US,www.csis.org,news,"November 24, 2025","DeepSeek, Huawei, Export Controls, and the Future of the U.S.-China AI Race","Photo: CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty Images Report by Gregory C. Allen Published March 7, 2025 Six months ago, few in the West aside from obsessive AI professionals had heard of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI research lab founded barely more than a year and a half ago. Today, DeepSeek is a global sensation attracting the attention of heads of state, global CEOs, top investors, and the general public. With the release of its R1 model on January 20, 2025—the same day as President Trump’s second inauguration—DeepSeek has cemented its reputation as the top frontier AI research lab in China and caused a reassessment of assumptions about the landscape of global AI competition. By January 27, DeepSeek’s iPhone app had overtaken OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app on Apple’s U.S. App Store. The stock prices of some U.S. tech companies briefly tumbled, including the AI chip designer Nvidia, which lost more than $600 billion off its valuation in a single day. (AI chips are also known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, and the terms are used interchangeably in this report.) ChatGPT has again overtaken DeepSeek in app store rankings, and Nvidia’s stock price has since mostly recovered . However, investor interest in Chinese tech companies has grown significantly and remains elevated. DeepSeek is now even reportedly seeking investment from venture capital firms. As a sector, AI is prone to overreactions and wild swings in perception. One might think that the story of DeepSeek is just another overblown AI hype cycle. However, the extraordinary attention focused on DeepSeek is justified, even if the conclusions some have drawn from its success are not. It would be a great mistake for U.S. policymakers to ignore DeepSeek or to suggest that its accomplishments are merely a combination of intellectual property theft and misleading Chinese propaganda. Policymakers need to understand that—even while DeepSeek has in some cases simply implemented innovations already known to U.S. AI companies—DeepSeek has also demonstrated genuine technological breakthroughs of its own. These facts deserve careful consideration as the second Trump administration sets its AI policy agenda. This paper provides an overview of DeepSeek’s origins and achievements, their geopolitical implications, and the key challenges facing U.S. and allied policymaking as a result. The paper pays particular attention to DeepSeek’s implications for the future of AI and semiconductor export control policy. It concludes that—while DeepSeek’s success does partly reflect failures of earlier implementations of U.S. export controls—these controls can continue to play a critical role in supporting the United States’ strategy for winning the AI race against China. Success is not guaranteed and will require two things: (1) Preventing large-scale AI chip smuggling and (2) Preventing the team of Huawei and SMIC from providing a viable Chinese AI chip alternative to the leading incumbent international team of Nvidia and TSMC. Both will be exceedingly difficult, and in both cases export controls can at best slow and disrupt Chinese efforts, not stop them. Regarding the second point, Chinese sources and leaders are expressing renewed optimism. At a meeting on February 17 between Chinese Community Party (CCP) Chairman Xi Jinping and Chinese technology executives (including DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng), Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei told Xi that his previous concerns about the lack of domestic advanced semiconductor production and the damaging impacts of U.S. export controls had eased because of recent breakthroughs by Huawei and its partners. Ren further said that he is leading a network of more than 2,000 Chinese companies who are collectively working to ensure that China achieves self-sufficiency of more than 70 percent across the entire semiconductor value chain by 2028. These predictions should be taken seriously. While China’s economy faces many challenges, Gerard DiPippo of RAND is correct to argue , Even if overall economic growth remains comparatively weak and many Chinese firms continue to struggle, China’s central and local governments will keep supporting high-tech industries and emerging stars like DeepSeek. . . . Western policymakers shouldn’t make the mistake of believing China is down and out, and they shouldn’t be surprised when China continues to catch up or make breakthroughs in critical and emerging technologies. What follows are a series of 21 key judgments regarding DeepSeek, Huawei, export controls, and the future of U.S.-China AI competition. Readers are advised to pay special attention to the discussion of Huawei and SMIC, as this report contains a great deal of new and previously private information regarding Huawei’s progress toward indigenizing China’s AI and semiconductor technology stack. DeepSeek is a subsidiary of High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund focused on algorithmic trading powered by deep learning. Deep learning is the core technology paradigm underlying the past two decades of rapid AI advancements. Cofounded in 2015 by Liang Wenfeng, who is also the founder and CEO of DeepSeek, High-Flyer was already ranked as the top Chinese hedge fund in 2019. DeepSeek’s heritage via High-Flyer in the algorithmic trading world helps to explain its success in frontier AI research and especially its success with its most recent model releases. Algorithmic trading firms frequently own and operate their own data center infrastructure, which they use to develop proprietary investment strategies powered by machine learning artificial intelligence . High-Flyer has admitted that its activities include “High-Frequency Trading,” though High-Flyer de-emphasizes this work since it is politically controversial (and was for a time banned) in China. High-frequency trading firms race against each other to be the fastest asset traders reacting to new market developments and are obsessively focused on optimizing and accelerating their computing infrastructure. These efforts routinely include intense research on developing proprietary and unorthodox data center engineering methods for improved speed and efficiency. Firms can justify making these expensive investments in computing and network infrastructure optimization because the success or failure of trades collectively worth billions of dollars depends upon reducing the time between learning of a fact and making a stock trade based on that new fact by mere nanoseconds (billionths of a second). High-Flyer is among the leaders of such firms in China and has long been among the most focused on both AI algorithms for trading and data center engineering. The Financial Times reported that, by mid-2022, High-Flyer had already acquired more than 10,000 Nvidia A100 chips (which at the time were the most advanced AI chips in the world) and spent more than 1.2 billion RMB (roughly $180 million at the time) to build two data centers. These infrastructure investments distinguished High-Flyer from most other Chinese companies: Only four other companies in China possessed such a large quantity of chips at the time, and all were major tech companies, not finance companies. In a 2023 interview, Liang said : We always wanted to carry out larger-scale experiments, so we’ve always aimed to deploy as much computational power as possible. . . . We wanted to find a paradigm that can fully describe the entire financial market. In another 2023 interview with a Chinese media outlet, Liang provided a timeline for High-Flyer’s AI chip compute reserves as a gradual “progression from one GPU in the beginning, to 100 GPUs in 2015, 1,000 GPUs in 2019.” He stated that, from the day of DeepSeek’s 2023 founding onward, High-Flyer had both the computational power and “ample R&D budgets” to support DeepSeek’s mission of “research and exploration” in pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI). DeepSeek’s heritage from High-Flyer’s machine learning research and intensive computing optimization techniques are evident in some of the strategies that it has pursued to develop its AI models. More broadly, the synergy of technical skills between the world of algorithmic trading and AI research is well known. For example, industry sources at leading U.S. AI labs told CSIS that they have also focused on recruiting talent, especially compute infrastructure engineers, with experience in the high-frequency trading industry. Both sectors pay such talented individuals handsomely. DeepSeek’s recent technological achievements (reflected in the DeepSeek-V2 , DeepSeek-V3 , DeepSeek-R1 , DeepSeek Math , and Native Sparse Attention technical papers) can most easily be understood through two basic facts: First, DeepSeek has demonstrated a suite of algorithmic and architectural improvements that significantly reduce the amount of computing power (and therefore financial investment) required for any AI model to reach and operate at a given level of performance. This is true for both the training stage (in which AI models are created) and the inference stage (in which their capabilities are used to serve internal or external customers). Second, DeepSeek has now developed AI models in China that are broadly comparable to the best U.S.-developed AI models introduced in mid-2024 (e.g., OpenAI’s o1 or Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet ). Of the two demonstrations, the fact that these advances came from China is more surprising than the fact that they happened at all. DeepSeek’s improvements in technical performance were consistent with preexisting trend lines of AI performance improvements. They represent expected performance breakthroughs, not shocking ones. To understand why, it is helpful to consider an analogy in the form of Moore’s Law. In economic terms , Moore’s Law essentially means that computer chips improve to be roughly twice as good in performance for the same amount of money roughly every two years. Though the nature of that performance improvement has changed, this trend has been consistently observed for almost six decades (with some caveats ). As Moore’s Law has been repeatedly validated since the 1960s, it has become steadily easier to confidently predict that computing performance per dollar will continue to double every two years. But, as the fortunes of Intel vividly demonstrate, that is not synonymous with being able to state with confidence which specific company or which specific technical innovations will deliver that improved performance. The same is true of AI today: It is easier to forecast the degree of AI performance growth than to forecast who will invent that performance growth or how. AI has its own versions of Moore’s Law that are driving exponential growth in both absolute performance and performance available at a given cost. At a high level, these sources of improvement can be grouped into three types: Epoch AI, an AI-focused nonprofit research institute, has estimated that, while the amount of human-generated training data will likely plateau in 2028, algorithmic and architectural improvements and increased computing resources have been improving at 3x per year and 4.6x per year respectively—for a combined multiplier effect of 13.8x per year. In short, AI performance is increasing at a rate far faster than the familiar (though still extraordinary) pace of exponential progress described by Moore’s Law. Even ignoring the possible remaining improvements from harvesting additional training data, a (highly oversimplified) back-of-the-envelope estimate of future performance based on the compute trends and algorithmic architectural trends would suggest that AI performance at the end of 2028 will be more than 36,000 times better than at the beginning of 2025, rather than just the four or eight times better that would be true if improvement were only occurring at the familiar pace of Moore’s Law. For those who only began paying attention to AI with the late 2022 launch of ChatGPT, this pace of progress can be both breathtaking and difficult to believe. However, for those familiar with the AI industry’s history over the past two decades, the fact that an AI model that requires a massive data center one year can run on a laptop or a single AI chip a few years later is well-known as a recurring , though still quite incredible, phenomenon. The dramatic reduction in cost-per-performance DeepSeek demonstrated is not a surprise to Western AI researchers. They have been leaders in driving—and benefitting from—the exact same trend for more than a decade. One might ask: “If that is the case, why are U.S. AI labs still building ever larger and more powerful data centers?” Put simply, such companies are reinvesting all efficiency gains toward improved overall performance. Dario Amodei, CEO of the U.S. AI lab Anthropic, put it this way : Because the value of having a more intelligent system is so high, this [reduced cost] shifting of the curve typically causes companies to spend more , not less, on training models: the gains in cost efficiency end up entirely devoted to training smarter models, limited only by the company’s financial resources. Moreover, AI researchers are clearly nowhere near the absolute ceiling of computational performance and efficiency. The human brain is a real-world existence proof of human-level intelligence that requires only 20 watts of electricity, compared to the megawatts or gigawatts contemplated for future AI data centers. Despite the many differences between human brains and machine intelligence, the existence of the brain hints at future intelligence efficiency possibilities in much the same way that bird wings inspired the Wright brothers. Thus, it is not at all surprising that somewhere on earth, an AI research lab managed to deliver the improved AI performance-per-dollar that DeepSeek’s technical papers demonstrate. The only surprise is that the research lab that discovered some of the relevant technical innovations is a Chinese one, and notably one whose technical team appears to have been educated and trained almost entirely in China, rather than at Western universities or Western companies. While Chinese researchers have been at or close to world class in many domains of AI research for many years, DeepSeek represents the first time that a Chinese AI lab has demonstrated breakthroughs at or near the absolute frontier of foundational AI research. Many of the techniques that DeepSeek demonstrated are now the new state-of-the-art. Of note, this is exactly what the Chinese government set as a goal in China’s 2017 official AI strategy : By 2025, China will achieve major breakthroughs in basic theories for AI, such that some technologies and applications achieve a world-leading level and AI becomes the main driving force for China’s industrial upgrading and economic transformation. In the first week after the publication of DeepSeek’s R1 paper, some commentators argued that DeepSeek’s results were fabricated as part of a Chinese propaganda effort or “psyop.” This is simply false. Researchers at U.S. universities have already reproduced some of the research results described in the DeepSeek V3 and R1 papers, and U.S. AI firms are already working on adapting DeepSeek’s novel techniques to utilize them in their own AI efforts. As will be discussed further in this paper, essentially all DeepSeek’s technical innovations relate to algorithmic and architectural improvements. DeepSeek did not have superior computing hardware, nor did they have access to uniquely important datasets (excluding synthetic data) that might have provided an advantage over Western researchers. The key technical innovations that DeepSeek demonstrated across the DeepSeek-V2 (May 2024), DeepSeek-V3 (December 2024), DeepSeek-R1 (January 2025), and other research papers are significant. Some of these innovations had already been independently discovered by U.S. firms (and not disclosed publicly), but others were genuinely new. Many media and policy commentators in the United States and China have argued that DeepSeek’s efficiency gains are evidence that U.S. export controls have failed to restrain China’s AI sector and that DeepSeek proves that huge numbers of cutting-edge U.S. AI chips are not required for developing and serving high-performance AI capabilities. There is some merit to aspects of the first claim, but the second is wrong. To begin, DeepSeek’s V3 research paper states that their models were trained on 2,788,000 GPU-hours using Nvidia H800 chips, which, at an estimated cost of 2 dollars per GPU-hour, equates to $5.576 million. The H800 is a degraded version of the H100 chip that Nvidia specifically developed for the Chinese market to comply with the U.S. export controls imposed on October 7, 2022 . In particular, those controls restricted the sale of chips that exceeded performance thresholds across two metrics: total processing power and interconnect speed. Government sources told CSIS that the U.S. government knew that these restrictions would prevent Nvidia from shipping its (at the time) market-leading A100 chip and upcoming H100 chips. They inferred that Chinese customers would be restricted to using the V100, which was first introduced in 2017 and has significantly lower performance than its successors. Additionally, the U.S. government assumed that, if Nvidia were to develop a new chip specifically for the Chinese market that exceeded export control performance thresholds in one metric but not the other, this would require the typical multiyear AI chip development timeline. What the U.S. government architects of the October 2022 export control policy did not realize, however, was that Nvidia had a mechanism for post-manufacturing modification of its existing chip products. Specifically, each Nvidia chip is designed for redundancy, recoverability, and defect tolerance to minimize the impact of manufacturing defects. Such defects are a significant concern in the advanced node semiconductor industry, and designing chips to mitigate their potential impact is near universal. Nvidia can blow one or more strategically placed electrical fuses on the chip so that a manufacturing defect would usually only reduce the chip’s performance or deactivate a redundant component, rather than rendering the entire chip nonfunctional. Industry sources confirmed to CSIS that Nvidia blew fuses on A100 chips to reduce their interconnect speed (but not their processing power) below the export control performance thresholds, thus creating the A800 product lines. In essence, the A100 was born with the capability to become an A800 if needed, via fuse settings. The H800, by contrast, did involve some minor Nvidia re-engineering and design optimization in the face of export controls. This allowed Nvidia to continue shipping large volumes of advanced AI chips (with performance near the global state of the art) to China without violating export controls and without taking multiple years to design new chips specifically for the Chinese market. According to reporting by The Information , the performance of the A800 and H800 chips was close enough to the performance of the originals that there was effectively no demand for large-scale AI chip smuggling to China during the period in which A800s and H800s were available. Why smuggle when the legally purchased chips are good enough? The Biden administration ultimately realized that continued sales of the A800 and H800 meant that their policy would not have the intended impact on China’s AI ecosystem. Former government officials told CSIS that this was clear internally by December 2022. However, it took the administration 12 months after their initial package of export controls to act. The U.S. government modified the export control performance thresholds in October 2023 to block exports of A800s, H800s, and any non-Nvidia chips with comparable performance to China. During the year-long period in which A800 and H800 chip exports to China were legal, an enormous number of them were sold to China. Precise sales figures are not available, but Nvidia’s disclosed sales to China between October 31, 2022, and October 31, 2023, exceeded 9 billion dollars. This does include revenue for chips that were not widely used in AI training or inference, however. See Table 1 for Nvidia’s quarterly revenue by billing locations. If DeepSeek were to admit that it used H100s in its data center to train its models, it would be confessing to activity illegal under U.S. law, since the H100 has never been legally available in China and cannot even legally be purchased by Chinese-firm subsidiaries outside of China. Thus, if DeepSeek did engage in illegal activity, it would have an incentive to conceal this fact. This raises the question of whether DeepSeek lied in its publications when it claimed to have used H800 chips exclusively. Industry analyst Ben Thompson has pointed to strong evidence that DeepSeek did in fact use H800s as it claimed: Many of DeepSeek’s algorithmic and architectural improvements are ideal for maximizing the effective use of computing resources under conditions of limited interconnect bandwidth. At a minimum, this strongly suggests that DeepSeek uses many H800s in its computing infrastructure and that a model with the performance of V3 can indeed be trained exclusively on H800s. This does not prove, however, that DeepSeek exclusively uses H800s in its overall computing infrastructure. Indeed, some reporting in Chinese news media claims that DeepSeek did train its slightly more recent R1 model on Nvidia H100 chips that are banned from China under U.S. export controls. The semiconductor consulting firm SemiAnalysis, citing anonymous industry sources, recently wrote that DeepSeek has a total of 50,000 Hopper generation GPUs, a category that includes H100s, H800s, and H20s. SemiAnalysis specifically claimed that it has evidence that High-Flyer’s/DeepSeek’s computing infrastructure includes at least 10,000 H100s, 10,000 H800s, 30,000 H20s, and 10,000 A100s as part of its total computing stack. SemiAnalysis further estimated that High-Flyer/DeepSeek spent $1.63 billion in GPU server capital expenditures alone (i.e., excluding other data center construction and operating costs). Nathan Lambert, a machine learning researcher at the Allen Institute of Artificial Intelligence, has correctly pointed out that Tracking the compute used for a project just off the final pretraining run is a very unhelpful way to estimate actual cost. It’s a very useful measure for understanding the actual utilization of the compute and the efficiency of the underlying learning , but assigning a cost to the model based on the market price for the GPUs used for the final run is deceptive. In this case, it is not DeepSeek that is being deceptive, however, since their paper was extremely clear about what was and was not included in the $5.6 million figure. It was only the final, successful pretraining run. It did not include the compute cost of the hundreds of experiments that were run beforehand to generate the insights necessary for that final run, nor did it include the compute costs associated with post-training fine-tuning or inference compute workloads. While there is no public evidence that large-scale Nvidia chip smuggling occurred prior to October 2023, industry sources told CSIS that, by early 2024, large-scale H100 chip smuggling operations were underway. In mid-2024, journalists at The Information interviewed participants in eight distinct H100 smuggling networks, each of which provided evidence that they had completed Chinese transactions worth more than $100 million. These networks continue to be active, with increasingly sophisticated techniques for evading detection. For example, a December 2024 investigation by The Information found that When notified of an upcoming inspection, smugglers have duplicated the serial numbers of the servers with Nvidia chips they’ve purchased from Supermicro [and already smuggled to China] and attached them to other servers they had access to. There is some evidence that governments are becoming more serious about cracking down on AI chip smuggling. Singapore was the billing location for 18 percent of Nvidia’s revenue in the most recently concluded fiscal year but the shipping location for only 2 percent of revenue. Officials in Singapore recently arrested three individuals accused of facilitating AI chip smuggling to China. The Singaporean government’s increased emphasis on cracking down on smuggling may reflect its concerns about being relegated to tier 2 status under the Biden administration’s AI Diffusion Framework . As with the introduction of Huawei’s Mate60 Pro 5G smartphone in August 2023, many commentators were quick to highlight how DeepSeek reflected the failure of U.S. export controls. This included Chinese state-owned media, one outlet of which, GlobalVision , broadcast that “DeepSeek and Huawei join forces! . . . breaking through U.S. tech restrictions is not impossible!” Angela Zhang, a professor at the Gould School of Law, went further, arguing : China’s achievements in efficiency are no accident. They are a direct response to the escalating export restrictions imposed by the US and its allies. By limiting China’s access to advanced AI chips, the US has inadvertently spurred its innovation. This argument is in one sense true: Chinese firms like DeepSeek prioritized innovation in efficiency—and particularly efficiency innovations that are useful given the limitations of the H800—because that was the most attractive AI research path available to them. However, this argument is deeply flawed for three reasons. First, every leading AI firm, including both U.S. and Chinese ones, is pursuing enhanced efficiency. As mentioned above, DeepSeek’s efficiency improvements represented a continuation of preexisting industry trends in AI computation efficiency improvements, not a drastic acceleration of them. Even before DeepSeek was founded, and even before the U.S. imposed export controls, DeepSeek’s parent company was obsessively focused on improving computing efficiency (though more focused on optimizing latency). It is strange to say that export controls caused AI firms to do something that they—both U.S. and Chinese—were already doing (and already had a massive financial incentive to do) before export controls were imposed. Second, the argument is flawed because it does not engage with the question of “how much further along might China be in the absence of export controls?” The largest AI computing cluster currently operating on Earth is xAI’s Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, which was recently upgraded to use 200,000 H100 chips . Given that leading Chinese firms were already producing more AI-related patents, publishing nearly as many highly cited research papers, and spending nearly as much on data center capital expenditures before the export controls went into effect, it is entirely possible that China would already be ahead of the United States in AI in the absence of export controls. Jimmy Goodrich, a non-resident senior associate at the Wadhwani AI Center, put it well when he said , “It’s been long known that DeepSeek has a really good team, and if they had access to even more compute, God knows how capable they would be.” Goodrich’s statement on DeepSeek applies to China as a whole. Third, this argument does not take account of the benefits of reallocating the supply of high-performance chips that would otherwise have gone to China. Nvidia, which is estimated to have 90 percent global market share in AI chips, is supply constrained, not demand constrained. For every Nvidia chip that TSMC has been able to manufacture since 2022, there are many customers willing to buy them. Larry Ellison, the cofounder of Oracle, colorfully described how Nvidia’s customers have to beg for greater chip allocation in September 2024 when he recounted a dinner between himself, xAI CEO Elon Musk, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang: I would describe the dinner as Oracle—me and Elon begging Jensen for GPUs, [saying] “Please take our money. Please take our money. By the way, I got dinner. No, no, take more of it. We need you to take more of our money please.” What this means is that, since the AI chip shortage began in 2022, all the chips that Nvidia would have sold to China in the absence of export controls would have come at the expense of customers elsewhere, which in this case is overwhelmingly the United States. In other words, eliminating the export controls would have not only helped China, it would have also hurt the United States, at least in terms of Nvidia chip allocation. For his part, DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng is under no illusions that the chip export controls have helped China or DeepSeek. In a July 2024 interview, he said , “We do not have financing plans in the short term. Money has never been the problem for us; bans on shipments of advanced chips are the problem.” Liang has also said in an interview with a Chinese media outlet that U.S. restrictions on AI chips mean that Chinese companies must use two to four times the computing power to achieve the same results, referring to the penalty of using the H800 instead of the H100 for large model training. Further evidence of the impact of U.S. export controls comes from the fact that DeepSeek experienced widespread outages and had to halt new user sign-ups in the wake of its massive user adoption growth. While DeepSeek claimed that the outages were the result of cyberattacks, the far more likely explanation is that they simply lacked sufficient computing capacity to serve their growing user base. There is a big difference between the amount of computing power required to serve an AI large language model to a small number of users and doing what OpenAI does, which is serve its AI models to 400 million active users every week. More recently, DeepSeek has once again reopened new user sign-ups, which likely reflects the company successfully purchasing or renting additional computing capacity. Nevertheless, the point remains: Compute capacity matters. In describing its goals toward creating AGI, a recent DeepSeek job advertisement said that “We believe AGI is the violent beauty of model x data x computing power.” Though a bit oversimplified, that formula is still essentially correct and helps explain why having larger computing resources is a useful advantage at any level of computational efficiency. All of DeepSeek’s innovations were algorithmic and architectural. DeepSeek appears to have described all or nearly all of them in great detail in its research papers. That means that U.S. AI labs are free to apply these same innovations in training and deploying their own AI models. Indeed, U.S. firms are already doing so . But while DeepSeek’s algorithmic innovations are replicable by U.S. firms, DeepSeek will struggle to replicate U.S. AI chip and compute advantages. In the absence of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) technology, China’s most advanced AI chip designer and logic chip manufacturer, Huawei and SMIC, respectively, will most likely remain stuck at 7 nanometers (nm) or perhaps a flawed 5 nm technology node for many years. The CEO of ASML, which is the sole firm in the world manufacturing EUV lithography machines, said “By banning the export of EUV, China will lag 10 to 15 years behind the West. That really has an effect.” By contrast, U.S. chip firms such as Nvidia will in coming years press forward past the 4 nm era into the 2 nm and beyond future, delivering chips that might be thousands or tens of thousands of times better performing integrated into data centers using tens or hundreds of times more chips. While there are still many ways in which the U.S. government could bungle export control implementation and enforcement—which will be discussed later in this paper—the greatest potential for impacts from the export controls are still well ahead in the future as the United States races forward and China’s progress continues to slow. Implemented properly, they offer the opportunity for a meaningful, though far from permanent, edge over China. Much of the initial commentary on DeepSeek suggested that demand for AI chips might plummet, as efficiency improvements meant that fewer chips were needed to achieve the same level of intelligence. While this is a generally accurate description of efficiency, it is a terrible description of how computing economics works. As mentioned above, Moore’s Law has driven a more than billionfold improvement in computing efficiency over the past seven decades. Does this mean that all of the world’s computing needs are handled by a single computer that costs only a fraction of a penny? Of course not. Instead, the increased efficiency has made applying digital computation throughout the economy far more attractive, and so more governments, businesses, and consumers have invested in more computation across countless applications and use cases. This is the essence of Jevon’s Paradox , which describes how increasing efficiency can increase aggregate demand. The same is obviously going to be true of increased AI computational efficiency. Indeed, after the DeepSeek revelations, the largest data center buyers in the world—Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon— announced that they were going to spend hundreds of billions of dollars in 2025 on AI chips and data centers, up by nearly 50 percent over the already record amount invested in 2024. Chinese firms such as Alibaba have announced that they too will make massive chip purchases in the wake of DeepSeek. Nor is this merely a long-term phenomenon. Even in the short term, rental prices for H100 chips hosted by Amazon’s cloud computing spiked upward in the wake of DeepSeek’s publication as customers worked to incorporate DeepSeek models into their operations. More recently, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that OpenAI would have to temporarily limit usage of its GPT 4.5 model because the company did not have sufficient GPUs to meet all of the demand. Moreover, there is almost certainly no “ceiling” for a desirable amount of intelligence and the computing required to power that intelligence. Miles Brundage, who previously led policy research at OpenAI, described it this way: To make a human-AI analogy, consider [Albert] Einstein or John von Neumann as the smartest possible person you could fit in a human brain. You would still want more of them. You’d want more copies. That’s basically what inference compute or test-time compute is—copying the smart thing. It’s better to have an hour of Einstein’s time than a minute, and I don’t see why that wouldn’t be true for AI. This again relates to how the most significant impacts of the export controls are likely in the future, as the evermore extremely scaled deployment of evermore powerful chips begins to bear fruit. It is the next few rounds of increasing AI computation—by tenfold, a hundredfold, a thousandfold—where China will be most severely blocked and the impact of the export controls will be most severely felt. Some Chinese AI researchers have made similar points. On February 13, 2025, Li Guojie, a scholar at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, told Chinese media outlet ChinaFund that DeepSeek’s success represents a step-change in Chinese AI capabilities but said that “due to the blockade of the U.S. government, China is currently unable to obtain the most advanced chip process technology.” Li went on to say [machine translation]: The success of DeepSeek does not deny the key role of computing power in the development of artificial intelligence. In fact, since there are much more equipment for reasoning than for training, the computing power required for reasoning [aka inference] will become the main requirement in the future. It is very important to improve the efficiency of the model through algorithm optimization. It is our basic choice to take the green development path of saving computing power, but computing power is definitely a necessary condition for solving artificial intelligence problems and cannot be ignored. On January 29, OpenAI told the New York Times that We know that groups in the P.R.C. are actively working to use methods, including what’s known as distillation, to replicate advanced U.S. A.I. models. . . . We are aware of and reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models. Distillation is a well-known technique that allows “the transfer of knowledge from a larger, more complex language model (the ‘teacher’) to a smaller, more efficient version (the ‘student’).” In short, the inputs and outputs from the teacher model are used as very high-quality synthetic training data by the student model. Distillation is utilized by every major U.S. AI lab to offer smaller, more efficient versions of its models that are faster and cheaper to serve to customers. For example, GPT-4o-mini is the distilled version of GPT-4o, and both were made by OpenAI. There are multiple types of distillation, however, and the more advanced types, which AI labs use to distill their own models, require access to the internals of the models. While a firm distilling its own models is clearly harmless, there is a strategic consideration if one firm can distill another firm’s models, incurring most or all of the benefits of acquiring a highly capable AI model while incurring far fewer of the costs of creating such a model. In the case of OpenAI and DeepSeek, the distillation evidence appears quite strong: DeepSeek’s initially released models, when asked by users “what model are you?,” will often respond , “I’m ChatGPT.” DeepSeek’s updated versions of the model, likely modified using fine-tuning techniques, no longer produce such responses, but this does not reduce the strength of the evidence that DeepSeek relied on distillation. Such unauthorized distillation would be a violation of OpenAI’s terms of service, but the law firm Fenwick has written that “whether remedies against such [a Terms of Service] breach would sufficiently protect teacher-model owner’s IP remains to be determined.” If OpenAI were to file a lawsuit against DeepSeek, for example, perhaps it would win in U.S. courts. But how would the size of judicial penalties compare to the strategic benefit for DeepSeek as a firm or for China as a country? And the access to judicial remedies is almost certainly limited to the United States and other countries with strong intellectual property protections. Even if DeepSeek were hypothetically clearly guilty of not only distillation but an even more extreme case of outright corporate espionage, Chinese courts would likely find OpenAI guilty of stealing IP from DeepSeek rather than the reverse. This is what happened to U.S. chipmaker Micron when it accused China’s Fujian Jinhua of stealing memory chip trade secrets and when U.S. prosecutors charged Fujian Jinhua with economic espionage. In retaliation, Jinhua sued Micron in a Chinese court for patent infringement in early 2018. The Fuzhou Intermediate People’s Court in Fujian province sided with the Chinese side and issued an injunction blocking Micron from selling 26 chip products in China. Similarly, when U.S. semiconductor equipment firm Veeco found that a Chinese competitor, Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment (AMEC), was using Veeco’s proprietary designs, Veeco secured a preliminary injunction in a U.S. court to stop a supplier from providing parts to AMEC. However, in response, AMEC filed a patent suit in China, and the Fujian High Court (the same province as above) acted with remarkable speed. On December 7, 2017—just weeks after AMEC’s filing—the court granted AMEC a preliminary injunction without even hearing Veeco’s defense. Thus, one should separate the questions of what is “fair” or “true” from what the strategic consequences are likely to be. Neither geopolitics nor business is a contest where first prize always goes to the most innovative. Many companies, including U.S. tech companies , have a perfectly viable business strategy of closely monitoring their innovative competitors and then either buying the competitor or replicating its innovation. Chinese firms can do the same, including in ways that both do and do not violate intellectual property. Thus, the meaningful strategic question for OpenAI and other U.S. AI firms is not whether DeepSeek is failing to play by the rules, it is whether U.S. firms have a mechanism for effectively preventing DeepSeek or any competitor from extracting the benefits of an AI lab’s investments without bearing the costs. What enduring sources of competitive advantages could the large U.S. AI labs secure if Chinese companies or other copycats (potentially even U.S. ones) can simply piggyback off their work to build cheaper and equivalently good models while incurring only a fraction of the costs? One possible answer comes in the form of Meta’s strategy, which is to invest in developing open-source AI models justified not by the direct benefits of increasing monthly subscriptions, but by the indirect benefits of enhancing their existing social media and advertising business lines. Among the worst outcomes for U.S. AI companies would be if the fundamentals of AI research and development were structurally similar to those of the global pharmaceutical industry. In 2023, the top 20 global pharmaceutical companies invested approximately $2.4 billion over 10 to 15 years into developing a typical new drug from start to finish. The costs of research and development dwarf those of drug manufacturing, marketing, and distribution, so the final price of the product must reflect the costs of research and development for pharmaceutical firms to have any hope of recovering their investments and earning a profit. To incentivize drug R&D, the U.S. government offers companies 20-year patents that allow them the exclusive right to sell their products in the United States at a monopoly premium to recover upfront R&D costs. However, once a patent expires, so-called generic manufacturers can reproduce and sell the same drug for a far lower price—avoiding the burden of R&D costs altogether. Generic manufacturers can thereafter compete by selling identical drugs while incurring only a tiny fraction of the costs faced by the original drug developer. In a world where there was no patent protection on new pharmaceuticals, investment in new drug discovery (and thus the pace of innovative new drugs) would be radically limited because governments and philanthropic actors might be the only ones willing to invest, and they would almost certainly do so at far lower levels than the current private sector does. Government and business-makers alike must now ask the question: What if frontier AI model research is structurally identical to that of the pharmaceutical industry, meaning extremely high upfront R&D costs and very low replication costs? The implications for AI investment and for U.S.-China AI competition could be significant. The U.S.-China AI race is very likely not one in which gentlemanly concepts of “fairness” matter. Chinese companies have systematically stolen American IP for years and will almost certainly continue to do so. Beyond Chinese firms, the Chinese government has a very clear history of either not enforcing or outright supporting Chinese firms that illegally violate U.S. patents in cases where the Chinese government has identified the industry as strategically significant. AI certainly falls into that category. Kai-Fu Lee, arguably the top venture capitalist in China’s AI sector, wrote in his 2018 book AI Superpowers that imitation does not have the same stigma in China that it does in the United States. He went further to argue that China’s unabashed willingness to copy innovation and even ignore intellectual property makes its companies more competitive, not less. In describing the post-2010 rise of hypercompetitive and cutthroat Chinese tech firms as “copycat gladiators,” Lee’s writing on this topic is worth quoting at length: Silicon Valley may have found the copying undignified and the tactics unsavory. In many cases, it was. But it was precisely this widespread cloning—the onslaught of thousands of mimicking competitors—that forced companies to innovate. Survival in the internet coliseum required relentlessly iterating products, controlling costs, executing flawlessly, generating positive PR [public relations], raising money at exaggerated valuations, and seeking ways to build a robust business ‘moat’ to keep the copycats out. Pure copycats never made for great companies, and they couldn’t survive inside this coliseum. But the trial-by-fire competitive landscape created when one is surrounded by ruthless copycats had the result of forging a generation of the most tenacious entrepreneurs on earth. As we enter the age of AI implementation, this cutthroat entrepreneurial environment will be one of China’s core assets in building a machine-learning-driven economy. Taking Lee’s argument one step further: If the future global competitive landscape for AI is one of ruthless copying in the absence of robust intellectual property protections, that is an environment where Chinese entrepreneurs ought to do extremely well, because it resembles the domestic Chinese tech ecosystem in which they grew up and thrived. Even over just the past three years, a diverse set of examples suggests that robustly protecting key knowledge in the AI field is likely to be extremely difficult: If you know which research dead ends to avoid (e.g., MCTS) and roughly know what research direction to pursue, replication is much easier. These algorithmic insights likely slowly leaked through SF party conversations and other channels. It probably takes a few months once you have the idea for [OpenAI’s reasoning AI model] o1 to replicate it. That’s how DeepSeek did it without much compute. While there is ongoing research into techniques to prevent model distillation, and AI companies will no doubt increase these efforts in the wake of DeepSeek, this remains an open question with significant implications. In an interview published in ChinaTalk , Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said , Like all problems in cybersecurity . . . [distillation is] going to be an ongoing issue. That’s why some companies have chosen to kind of hide the chain of thought in their reasoning models, because it makes it much harder to distill. Those can be jailbroken. But folks are working on antidotes to jailbreaking. We just released something today that makes it much harder to jailbreak models . Even in a case where distillation and more explicit cases of technological espionage are difficult or impossible to prevent, however, there will remain the issue inference computation, which involves applying more computational resources so that the model can “think” harder about the answer to a question or so that the model can be used more times and serve more users. One way of thinking about this is that the nature of competitive advantage in AI could be shifting from a secret that one keeps (i.e., the model weights ) toward an asset that one controls (i.e., massive data center compute infrastructure). This means that export controls—if implemented and enforced effectively—still have an opportunity to have a strategic impact. Nevertheless, the U.S. government and U.S. AI firms need to take a tough look at whether and how they can remain competitive in a world where China does not respect intellectual property and is committed to devoting enormous state resources to technical espionage in the AI and semiconductor sectors. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) at the U.S. Department of Commerce is the agency charged with adjudicating license applications and enforcing export controls, not just on semiconductors bound for China, but for all U.S. dual-use technology exports that might end up in Russia, Iran, North Korea, and many other restricted destinations. To implement its work overseeing trillions of dollars in economic activity and policing smuggling operations worldwide, BIS has fewer than 600 employees and a relatively paltry budget of just under $200 million. Semiconductors are just one technology category out of hundreds that this organization is responsible for enforcing. Reporting by The Information found at least eight Chinese AI chip–smuggling networks, with each engaging in transactions valued at more than $100 million. More recent reporting by the Wall Street Journal suggests that this smuggling now includes the latest generation of Nvidia Blackwell AI chips. China is betting that its network of smugglers and shell companies can find the leaks in the BIS export control enforcement barrier. As long as Congress continues to neglect BIS by providing grossly inadequate resources compared to the size and importance of its mission, China has a reasonable expectation of success. BIS needs not only more money, but also more skilled staff, more enforcement agents, and better enabling technology, especially in data analysis . Moreover, the Department of Commerce needs more help from the rest of the government, in particular the U.S. intelligence community. Declassified Central Intelligence Agency documents show that the intelligence community was deeply involved in assisting export control enforcement during the Cold War and delivered solid results by doing so. These are capabilities and priorities that have significantly atrophied in the post–Cold War era but urgently need to be restored. Recent efforts by the Trump administration to reduce government spending risk making a bad situation worse. On February 5, 2025, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi signed a Department of Justice memorandum that, among many other actions, disbanded the National Security Division’s Corporate Enforcement Unit, which was “created with the goal of investigating and prosecuting corporate actors involved in sanctions evasion, export control violations, and other national security-related economic crimes.” The memo did not provide any explanation for how the duties of the unit would be performed elsewhere in the Department of Justice, which could mean that this will be implemented as a straightforward reduction in U.S. government capacity to enforce export controls. Of all the choices available, the worst policy choice that the U.S. government could make is to regulate aggressively but with large loopholes and weak enforcement. Such an approach—which fairly describes the approach taken in the first Trump administration and large chunks of the Biden administration—incurs nearly all the costs of an aggressive export control policy but does so without providing any of the possible strategic benefits in terms of slowing Chinese progress in semiconductors and AI. As described above, the nature of AI geopolitical advantage appears to be moving away from software secrets that are difficult to protect and toward hardware chip and data center assets that are (hopefully) easier to protect. In this sense, DeepSeek is not in and of itself the most significant threat to U.S. leadership in AI. Instead, the greater challenge arises from the possibility of China having a domestic ecosystem for producing its own AI chips at large scale and integrating them into Chinese data center training, as well as running inference for DeepSeek and other AI models. As U.S. technology firms are planning hundreds of billions of dollars in AI data center infrastructure investments, it is worth remembering that—for those investments to be possible—companies like TSMC must manufacture enough AI chips to fill those data centers. In the case of companies such as Nvidia, their revenue growth in recent years is less than it would have otherwise been due to shortages of TSMC production capacity. The Biden administration took many steps designed to definitively cut China’s AI chip designers off from TSMC production capacity. Most recently, on January 15, the Commerce Department announced the final tranche of Biden administration export controls, often referred to as “the Foundry Rule.” The Foundry Rule moved advanced chip production to a white-list system that will likely make it impossible for Chinese AI firms to access TSMC capacity to produce chips above export control performance thresholds even when operating through complex shell company arrangements. However, as discussed below, TSMC manufactured a strategically significant quantity of chips on behalf of Huawei via shell companies prior to the rule going into effect. That effectively means that China’s long-term future in AI is closely tied to its ability to produce AI chips domestically. The Biden administration sought to hamstring China’s domestic production of advanced chips by restricting the sale of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, including from other countries. Historically, one of the biggest sources of competitive advantage for Nvidia has been its CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) software ecosystem. CUDA makes it much easier for programmers to write massively parallelized software (as all modern AI software is) and ensures backward and forward compatibility so that older chips can still run newer software and vice versa. Any customer who seeks to stop using Nvidia chips has to leave the CUDA ecosystem, which requires solving a lot of incredibly hard software problems for which CUDA already provides free answers. Those free answers reflect billions of dollars of investment in the CUDA platform by both Nvidia and its customers. DeepSeek stands out among AI model developers because it implemented software changes below the CUDA level. Most AI researchers rely on CUDA, a higher-level programming language for NVIDIA GPUs, because it simplifies the development process. However, CUDA does not allow fine-grained control over GPU operations at the level DeepSeek required. DeepSeek modified software instructions written in a language called PTX (Parallel Thread Execution). By programming directly in PTX, DeepSeek engineers were able to optimize how the GPU handled specific workloads, particularly in managing expert specialization in the Mixture-of-Experts model and improving memory efficiency. This is an “assembly-level” approach to GPU programming—one that is both extremely difficult and (at least historically) rarely attempted. The trade-off, however, was a major increase in performance efficiency, particularly for large-scale AI training tasks. This suggests that DeepSeek may have both the technical knowledge and the open-source community enthusiasm to finally start generating momentum around Huawei’s competitor to CUDA, which Huawei refers to as its Compute Architecture for Neural Networks (CANN). The greater maturity of the CUDA software ecosystem currently makes Nvidia chips more attractive, but this could change over the next few years. If it does, it would have major implications for Nvidia’s competitiveness both inside and outside of China. At present, the combination of Ascend chips (discussed more below) and CANN software appears far from being competitive to CUDA. A Financial Times report from September 2024 found that even Huawei employees found the product “difficult and unstable to use” and prone to crashing frequently. Industry sources told CSIS that DeepSeek’s more recent evaluation of CANN was very negative and that DeepSeek assessed that it would be years before the combination of Ascend chips and CANN-compatible software was a viable alternative. Still, this could change with time, effort, and investment. Huawei recently joined the open-source PyTorch foundation in an effort to increase Ascend and CANN compatibility of the PyTorch AI development framework. There is at least one meaningful precedent regarding the difficulty of leaving the Nvidia CUDA ecosystem, which is Google’s shift from TensorFlow on Nvidia GPUs to JAX on their proprietary chips, called TPUs. In this case, it took several years for JAX to mature and for a critical mass of software libraries to appear—even with heavy Google investment and the payoff opportunity in terms of both efficiency and competitive differentiation. Even by 2023, Google was still heavily investing to improve JAX (for example, addressing pain points like multi-host setup and memory efficiency) and encouraging its use through education (tutorials, conference workshops). For a company like DeepSeek, migrating all AI workloads from CUDA to CANN would likely be a multiyear project. Google’s internal shift took 2–3 years to bear significant fruit, and even then Google maintained support for both for a long while. Domestically producing large quantities of AI chips will require China to domestically replicate multiple segments of the AI chip value chain. The most important links are AI chip design, advanced node logic chip manufacturing, and advanced node high-bandwidth memory (HBM) manufacturing. Each of these will be addressed in turn. Like the United States, China has many different companies working on AI chip design, including Huawei, Cambricon, Biren, and more. However, Huawei is unambiguously in the strongest position with its Ascend AI chip product line. Industry sources also told CSIS that Huawei—due to its highly influential position with the Chinese government and its size as a customer—has the greatest leverage over SMIC. In other words, even if Huawei were not the best AI chip designer in China, it would still be the most important since it is in a position to restrict the share of SMIC manufacturing capacity that goes toward its domestic competitors. Huawei has been a player in the AI chip market for longer than is generally realized. Huawei had a 7 nm AI Accelerator chip planned for production at TSMC in 2020 . At the time, Huawei was preparing to capitalize the so-called 3-5-2 policy , in which the CCP’s Central Office ordered all government agencies and many state-owned enterprises to eliminate the use of all non-Chinese technology within three years. However, Huawei was unable to fulfill demand because of the first Trump administration’s updated 2020 entity listing , which temporarily cut Huawei’s Ascend and Kirin lines off from TSMC. In this instance, Nvidia was the beneficiary of these early U.S. export controls, which delivered a setback to Chinese efforts to eliminate dependence on U.S. AI chip technology. Today, Huawei’s Ascend product line is focused on the Ascend 910B and the Ascend 910C, the latter of which includes two Ascend 910B logic dies per integrated unit (meaning more real estate on each silicon wafer is required for manufacturing an Ascend 910C than a 910B). DeepSeek has reportedly evaluated the Ascend chips and found that they are unattractive for training AI models but that each Ascend 910C delivers roughly 60 percent of the performance of an Nvidia H100 for inferencing AI models. This matters greatly since more and more of the computing requirements for advanced AI models are expected to be devoted to inference in the coming years. Barclays, an investment bank, estimates that by 2026, 70 percent of AI compute demand will come from inference. In February 2024, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that utilization of its chips was “40 percent inference, 60 percent training,” compared to 90 percent training-focused in the 2016 timeframe. Chinese firms like Huawei have historically had two major options for manufacturing their AI chip designs: outsource production abroad to TSMC of Taiwan or produce chips domestically in partnership with SMIC. For a time, it seemed as though the 2020 entity listing of Huawei definitively cut the company off from accessing TSMC advanced node manufacturing capacity. The October 2022 and October 2023 export controls were supposed to have done the same for all advanced node AI chip designers in China. However, TSMC manufactured large quantities of Huawei Ascend 910B chips on behalf of Huawei shell companies and shipped the chips to China in violation of U.S. export controls. In an interview with the New York Times , an unnamed Taiwanese official acknowledged that these chips “ended up in the hands of Huawei.” Government officials told CSIS that TSMC manufactured more than 2 million Ascend 910B logic dies and that all of these are now with Huawei. If true, this is enough dies to make 1 million Ascend 910C units. However, the advanced packaging process by which two Ascend 910B dies and HBM are combined into a unified Ascend 910C chip also introduces defects that can compromise the functionality of the chip. Industry sources told CSIS that roughly 75 percent of the Ascend 910Cs currently survive the advanced packaging process. This is a strategically significant stockpile of AI chips. For comparison, Nvidia reportedly shipped 1 million H20 chips (which are inference specialized and targeted at the Chinese market) to China in 2024. Nvidia’s January 26 SEC filing states that it generated $17 billion in revenues from Chinese customers in the most recently ended fiscal year (which would obviously exclude revenues from chips later smuggled to China). Presumably, the vast majority of these revenues are from H20 sales. Even though Huawei likely has the more than 2 million Ascend 910B logic dies made by TSMC, there is a question as to whether it has enough HBM to integrate with those dies in manufacturing 1 million Ascend 910Cs. It seems likely that Huawei does, however, since the U.S. plan to restrict all advanced HBM sales to China on a country-wide basis was leaked to Bloomberg in August 2024 and did not go into effect until December of that year, giving Huawei ample time to legally acquire HBM chips as part of a stockpiling strategy. Industry sources told CSIS that Huawei has stockpiled enough HBM to meet their internal expectations for at least a full year’s worth of production, mostly in the form of purchases from Samsung of South Korea, potentially via shell companies, that occurred before the December controls went into effect. It is as though the U.S. government was having an internal debate about whether or not to have a surprise attack, and in the spirit of compromise, the slow interagency process settled on attacking without the surprise. This was an egregious failure with strategic consequences. With the adoption of the Foundry Rule , it will hopefully be impossible for Huawei or other Chinese AI chip designers to ever again access TSMC manufacturing capacity, even when using sophisticated shell company tactics. Huawei will instead be restricted to what Chinese domestic logic chip manufacturers can produce. However, there is also the potential risk that an existing chip design company on the Foundry Rule white list could be tempted by massive revenue opportunities to act as a pass-through to give Huawei access to TSMC. Guarding against this risk will require making clear to TSMC that the negative consequences of continuing to supply Huawei with advanced AI chips would be colossal compared to the revenue and profit opportunity. Similarly, Huawei may attempt similar tactics with other chip foundries such as Samsung or even Intel. The most advanced logic chip manufacturer in China is SMIC. SMIC’s SN2 facility in Shanghai is the sole facility in China with an active 7 nm logic chip production line and has been producing 7 nm chips since July 2021 , more than a year before the first tranche of the Biden administration’s semiconductor equipment export controls went into effect. SMIC and Huawei are now working to bring a 5 nm node into scaled production but must do so without access to EUV lithography equipment, since China has no local producer of EUV lithography machines and since export controls have prevented such machines from ever being exported to China. Industry sources told CSIS that, in early 2020, ASML was poised to ship EUV tools to China and that SMIC was planning to work with key research labs in Europe, such as the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (IMEC), to help develop their EUV-based manufacturing process. In December 2024, industry sources told CSIS that SMIC currently has enough immersion deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography equipment supplied by the Dutch company ASML to produce 85,000 FinFET wafers per month (WPM) across both SN1 (which focuses on 14 nm node production) and SN2 (which focuses on 7 nm and 5 nm production). This acquisition of lithography tools reportedly took effect before Dutch DUV lithography export controls went into effect in mid-2023. However, the bottleneck in expanding 7 nm (which in SMIC’s node naming system is called “N+2”) production capacity has not been lithography but rather U.S. tools for etching, deposition, inspection, and metrology. The shortage of inspection and metrology tools has also been an important factor preventing SMIC from improving its yield. SMIC acquired lithography equipment as a stockpiling measure in anticipation of future export controls by the Dutch government. Low production rate also has an impact on yield, since manufacturing technicians and engineers tend to improve their techniques based on experimentation and observed results from production. Thus, more production is helpful in accelerating the pace of learning and thus improving the yield. Based on the Ascend 910B die size of 665.61 mm², CSIS estimates that each 300-millimeter diameter silicon wafer produces roughly 80 chip dies. This is simply counting the number of small rectangles (chip dies) that can fit inside the large circle (the wafer). A source told CSIS that of these 80 chip dies: SMIC’s 20 percent yield when producing Ascend 910Bs is quite low, but it is not as low as it might seem. In 2020, when Nvidia moved its GPU production to TSMC’s 7 nm process, the defect-free yield rate was roughly 41.5 percent . Since manufacturing defects occur randomly on a defects per square centimeter of chip area basis, larger chips (such as AI chips) are more susceptible than smaller chips (such as smartphone application processors) to a high defect rate. Using TSMC during roughly the same time period and with roughly the same defect rate, Apple’s A12 processor enjoyed 90 percent+ yield. SMIC also makes the application processor for Huawei’s Mate smartphone line, and its yield when making these smaller chips is somewhere in the 50–70 percent range. However, a February 24, 2025 report by the Financial Times , citing two anonymous individuals, claims that SMIC’s AI chip yield has increased to roughly 40 percent. Industry sources told CSIS that the Financial Times report is not correct and that Huawei/SMIC’s true yield remains at 20 percent. One explanation for the discrepancy would be if the Financial Times’ sources were mistakenly including both the fully functional chips and the chips that are functional but with degraded performance when estimating yield. As mentioned above, SMIC’s shortage of deposition, etching, inspection, and metrology semiconductor manufacturing equipment also been an important factor preventing expanded production capacity of its SN2 facility. Some of this equipment is restricted on a country-wide basis, meaning that it cannot be legally sold anywhere in China. However, other types of this equipment were restricted only on an end-use and end-user basis. This means that the equipment can be sold to some customers in China but not others. In some cases, this even means that it can be sold to some facilities of a particular customer, but not others. In such cases, relocating the equipment from one facility to another would require a new export license in order to be legal. But SMIC’s production of 7 nm chips using U.S. equipment is already illegal , and both SMIC and other Chinese firms always have the option to choose illegal activity, particularly since such activity frequently enjoys the active support of the Chinese government. Industry sources told CSIS that SiEn, Pensun, and Huawei’s fab in Dongguan all were able to legally acquire the needed etching, deposition, and inspection/metrology equipment that SMIC needs for two reasons: (1) the equipment was not restricted on a country-wide basis to all of China and (2) the equipment was restricted on an end-use and end-user basis, but SiEn and Pensun told U.S. firms that it would exclusively be used for producing chips less advanced than 14 nm. These firms also denied any affiliation with Huawei. Government officials told CSIS that in such circumstances, the equipment can often be sold under a no-license required status. According to the sources, SiEn and Pensun, however, did not have sufficient customers providing demand for using all of the equipment they had purchased, and so some of it was never used operationally in their fabs. They purchased the equipment as a stockpiling move in anticipation of future export controls. The source described this as a “buy everything you can, while you can” strategy. The SMIC SN2 facility needed the equipment. Since SiEn and Pensun were not making economically productive use of the equipment, they were amenable to a sale. This sale was negotiated in Q4 of 2024 and completed in Q1 of 2025. The sources are under the impression that all of the desired equipment is currently either installed at SMIC SN2 or on-site awaiting installation. This equipment will eliminate the near-term U.S. equipment bottleneck facing SMIC for SN2 7 nm production. SMIC’s new 7 nm production bottleneck is the overall size of the facility. Prior public statements from SMIC indicated that the SN1 and SN2 facilities combined have a maximum capacity of 85,000 WPM and that SMIC intended to split production evenly between the two facilities, implying SMIC was targeting ~42,500 WPM of lithography capacity at SN2. Sources told CSIS that SMIC was targeting 50,000 WPM of 7 nm specifically by the end of 2025. It is unclear whether this means that 7 nm production will now also take place at SN1 or whether SMIC has figured out a production process and equipment configuration that allows them to squeeze more production capacity than expected into SN2. If, hypothetically, SMIC were to devote all 50,000 WPM to Ascend 910C manufacturing, this would imply producing 4 million Ascend 910B dies per month, of which 800,000 would be fully functional. 800,000 910B Ascend dies is enough to manufacture 400,000 910C chips, though the advanced packaging process would reduce yield further, and it is unclear how much HBM Huawei has on hand. SMIC is unlikely to devote all of its 7 nm capacity to Ascend chips. Huawei needs that 7 nm capacity for its chips for smartphones, laptops, data centers, and telecommunications equipment. Moreover, SMIC has other customers besides Huawei. Still, the point remains that Huawei is likely poised to dramatically expand Ascend production in the near future. Over time, SMIC’s 7 nm yield will likely improve significantly above 20 percent due to the additional equipment and the increased production rate. It will likely not match the best TSMC 7 nm yields for AI chips, however, since TSMC’s best 7 nm yields used EUV, and China has no credible near-term path for acquiring EUV technology. Over the mid and long term, however, Huawei is working aggressively to produce a domestic alternative to ASML EUV technology. Huawei currently has two semiconductor manufacturing equipment tool research facilities, one in Shanghai and one in Shenzhen. According to a report by Nikkei Asia, Huawei is investing $1.66 billion in the Shanghai facility alone and has hired a large number of chip industry veterans with experience working at companies like Applied Materials, Lam Research, KLA, ASML, TSMC, Intel, and Micron. Taylor Ogan, a venture capitalist based in Shenzhen, China, focused on investing in Chinese technology companies, described Huawei’s EUV efforts as follows: There are teams at Huawei in two different parts of China that are working around the clock. . . . They are literally cut off from their friends and family just because the work they are doing is so sensitive, and imagine how quickly they’re going to accelerate Chinese complete domestic chip development. . . . One of them is in Shenzhen. That’s the bigger [EUV lithography] breakthrough lab, and you can look on Google Earth. There was nothing there and now there is something there, and there are thousands of people working there. The other one is around Shanghai and that is more for the next chips in the next phones. So, yeah, the bigger lithography breakthroughs are [being worked on] in Shenzhen. . . . They’re working their asses off. . . . This is like some of the smartest people in the space, and they’re all Chinese. As mentioned above, these secretive efforts underway at Huawei are extremely likely to be benefitting from state-backed industrial espionage, including the cyberattacks on ASML and its partners . A high-quality recent analysis by Nicholas Welch, Lily Ottinger, and Jordan Schneider of ChinaTalk concludes that China’s current compute shortage has more to do with practical challenges and suboptimal deployment—many idle small and medium data centers rather than fewer fully-utilized superclusters—than it does with an absolute shortage of chips. A combination of recent Chinese government policy changes, such as “hand[ing] over their idle computing resources to cloud providers” and strategic moves by China’s largest tech companies to favor DeepSeek models even over their in-house ones, suggests that this could change in the near future. According to reporting by Caijing Magazine , the chips in China most likely to be underutilized are Huawei’s Ascends, which have benefitted in terms of government pressure to buy domestic but remain underutilized because of a lack of useful AI models that are Ascend-compatible. This could change if DeepSeek adapts its models to run on Ascends, which it is reportedly working toward for model inference, though not model training. As mentioned above, sources told CSIS that TSMC has supplied Huawei with enough chip dies to manufacture a million Ascend 910C chips, each of which has roughly 60 percent the performance of an Nvidia H100 when used for inference. With the help of Huawei and the Chinese government, DeepSeek could plausibly succeed in driving a reallocation of the Nvidia H800s and H100s already in China toward itself for construction of a new AI model training data center. This could then be augmented by an additional, much larger cluster of Huawei Ascend 910Cs (or Nvidia H20s) to be used for AI model inference. Such a combination is a plausible, perhaps even likely, path for China to continue making significant progress in its AI development. As discussed above, a million-chip cluster of Huawei Ascends would face the challenge of a shortage of AI models, software, and developer tools that are compatible with Huawei’s CANN software ecosystem. A second challenge is in integrating all of the chips as part of a single cluster where the whole is more than the sum of the parts. Financial Times reporter Eleanor Olcott interviewed one Beijing-based chip investor who said “The bottleneck at the moment isn’t getting the chips but figuring out how to make them work in a cluster. This is really complicated work.” Evidently the true attractiveness of the Huawei Ascend 910C chips is worse than the “60 percent of H100” figure might suggest. As discussed above, in the absence of export controls, it is plausible that Chinese firms would have already surpassed their U.S. competitors in developing and deploying frontier AI models. It is likewise plausible that China might have already succeeded in driving widespread adoption of the Huawei Ascend chips, just as Huawei’s smartphone division, bolstered by internal chip designs, was looking poised to overtake Apple’s iPhone in China prior to the introduction of effective export controls in 2020. The export controls have done much to slow and complicate China’s technological rise and march toward their longstanding objective of technological self-sufficiency. They are still having a significant effect even now and are poised to have even greater impact in the future as U.S. firms benefit from Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell chips and as China likely remains stuck at the 7 nm technology node until and unless they develop a domestic EUV lithography capability. However, China’s successes in substantial government investment, chip smuggling, exploiting gaps in U.S. export control coverage, completing in-country transfers of equipment, hiring talent with experience from leading international firms, reverse-engineering foreign technology, harnessing state-backed economic espionage, and producing genuine domestic innovation are a formidable combination. U.S. firms, working at maximum effort and with the benefit of all their own advantages, will still likely be the first to develop artificial general intelligence or artificial superintelligence. This should not, however, be taken for granted. At a meeting on February 17 between CCP Chairman Xi Jinping and Chinese technology executives, including DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng, Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei told Xi that his previous concerns about the lack of domestic advanced semiconductor production and the damaging impacts of U.S. export controls had eased because of recent breakthroughs by Huawei and its partners. It is possible that he is referring to the aforementioned domestic equipment transfer to SMIC’s facility. Ren further said that he is leading a network of more than 2,000 Chinese companies that are collectively working to ensure that China achieves self-sufficiency of more than 70 percent across the entire semiconductor value chain by 2028. These predictions should be taken seriously and have enormous strategic implications beyond just the AI sector. However, for AI, the key question remains the one that Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, has succinctly posed : “whether China will also be able to get millions of chips.” China’s success to date suggests that, at least for Huawei Ascend chips, the answer is that they will have millions of chips within the next year or two. Thankfully, these chips are, at present, dramatically lower performing than Nvidia ones for training advanced AI models; they are also supported by a much weaker software ecosystem with many complex issues that will likely take years to sort out. This is the time that the export controls have bought for the United States to win the race to AGI and then use that victory to try and build more durable strategic advantages. At this point, all the margin for sloppy implementation of export controls or tolerance of large-scale chip smuggling has already been consumed. There is no more time to waste. Gregory C.

Allen Published March 7, 2025 Six months ago, few in the West aside from obsessive AI professionals had heard of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI research lab founded barely more than a year and a half ago. Today, DeepSeek is a global sensation attracting the attention of heads of state, global CEOs, top investors, and the general public. With the release of its R1 model on January 20, 2025—the same day as President Trump’s second inauguration—DeepSeek has cemented its reputation as the top frontier AI research lab in China and caused a reassessment of assumptions about the landscape of global AI competition. By January 27, DeepSeek’s iPhone app had overtaken OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app on Apple’s U.S. App Store. The stock prices of some U.S. tech companies briefly tumbled, including the AI chip designer Nvidia, which lost more than $600 billion off its valuation in a single day. (AI chips are also known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, and the terms are used interchangeably in this report.) ChatGPT has again overtaken DeepSeek in app store rankings, and Nvidia’s stock price has since mostly recovered . However, investor interest in Chinese tech companies has grown significantly and remains elevated. DeepSeek is now even reportedly seeking investment from venture capital firms. As a sector, AI is prone to overreactions and wild swings in perception. One might think that the story of DeepSeek is just another overblown AI hype cycle. However, the extraordinary attention focused on DeepSeek is justified, even if the conclusions some have drawn from its success are not. It would be a great mistake for U.S. policymakers to ignore DeepSeek or to suggest that its accomplishments are merely a combination of intellectual property theft and misleading Chinese propaganda. Policymakers need to understand that—even while DeepSeek has in some cases simply implemented innovations already known to U.S. AI companies—DeepSeek has also demonstrated genuine technological breakthroughs of its own. These facts deserve careful consideration as the second Trump administration sets its AI policy agenda. This paper provides an overview of DeepSeek’s origins and achievements, their geopolitical implications, and the key challenges facing U.S. and allied policymaking as a result. The paper pays particular attention to DeepSeek’s implications for the future of AI and semiconductor export control policy. It concludes that—while DeepSeek’s success does partly reflect failures of earlier implementations of U.S. export controls—these controls can continue to play a critical role in supporting the United States’ strategy for winning the AI race against China. Success is not guaranteed and will require two things: (1) Preventing large-scale AI chip smuggling and (2) Preventing the team of Huawei and SMIC from providing a viable Chinese AI chip alternative to the leading incumbent international team of Nvidia and TSMC. Both will be exceedingly difficult, and in both cases export controls can at best slow and disrupt Chinese efforts, not stop them. Regarding the second point, Chinese sources and leaders are expressing renewed optimism. At a meeting on February 17 between Chinese Community Party (CCP) Chairman Xi Jinping and Chinese technology executives (including DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng), Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei told Xi that his previous concerns about the lack of domestic advanced semiconductor production and the damaging impacts of U.S. export controls had eased because of recent breakthroughs by Huawei and its partners. Ren further said that he is leading a network of more than 2,000 Chinese companies who are collectively working to ensure that China achieves self-sufficiency of more than 70 percent across the entire semiconductor value chain by 2028. These predictions should be taken seriously. While China’s economy faces many challenges, Gerard DiPippo of RAND is correct to argue , Even if overall economic growth remains comparatively weak and many Chinese firms continue to struggle, China’s central and local governments will keep supporting high-tech industries and emerging stars like DeepSeek. . . . Western policymakers shouldn’t make the mistake of believing China is down and out, and they shouldn’t be surprised when China continues to catch up or make breakthroughs in critical and emerging technologies. What follows are a series of 21 key judgments regarding DeepSeek, Huawei, export controls, and the future of U.S.-China AI competition. Readers are advised to pay special attention to the discussion of Huawei and SMIC, as this report contains a great deal of new and previously private information regarding Huawei’s progress toward indigenizing China’s AI and semiconductor technology stack. DeepSeek is a subsidiary of High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund focused on algorithmic trading powered by deep learning. Deep learning is the core technology paradigm underlying the past two decades of rapid AI advancements. Cofounded in 2015 by Liang Wenfeng, who is also the founder and CEO of DeepSeek, High-Flyer was already ranked as the top Chinese hedge fund in 2019. DeepSeek’s heritage via High-Flyer in the algorithmic trading world helps to explain its success in frontier AI research and especially its success with its most recent model releases. Algorithmic trading firms frequently own and operate their own data center infrastructure, which they use to develop proprietary investment strategies powered by machine learning artificial intelligence . High-Flyer has admitted that its activities include “High-Frequency Trading,” though High-Flyer de-emphasizes this work since it is politically controversial (and was for a time banned) in China. High-frequency trading firms race against each other to be the fastest asset traders reacting to new market developments and are obsessively focused on optimizing and accelerating their computing infrastructure. These efforts routinely include intense research on developing proprietary and unorthodox data center engineering methods for improved speed and efficiency. Firms can justify making these expensive investments in computing and network infrastructure optimization because the success or failure of trades collectively worth billions of dollars depends upon reducing the time between learning of a fact and making a stock trade based on that new fact by mere nanoseconds (billionths of a second). High-Flyer is among the leaders of such firms in China and has long been among the most focused on both AI algorithms for trading and data center engineering. The Financial Times reported that, by mid-2022, High-Flyer had already acquired more than 10,000 Nvidia A100 chips (which at the time were the most advanced AI chips in the world) and spent more than 1.2 billion RMB (roughly $180 million at the time) to build two data centers. These infrastructure investments distinguished High-Flyer from most other Chinese companies: Only four other companies in China possessed such a large quantity of chips at the time, and all were major tech companies, not finance companies. In a 2023 interview, Liang said : We always wanted to carry out larger-scale experiments, so we’ve always aimed to deploy as much computational power as possible. . . . We wanted to find a paradigm that can fully describe the entire financial market. In another 2023 interview with a Chinese media outlet, Liang provided a timeline for High-Flyer’s AI chip compute reserves as a gradual “progression from one GPU in the beginning, to 100 GPUs in 2015, 1,000 GPUs in 2019.” He stated that, from the day of DeepSeek’s 2023 founding onward, High-Flyer had both the computational power and “ample R&D budgets” to support DeepSeek’s mission of “research and exploration” in pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI). DeepSeek’s heritage from High-Flyer’s machine learning research and intensive computing optimization techniques are evident in some of the strategies that it has pursued to develop its AI models. More broadly, the synergy of technical skills between the world of algorithmic trading and AI research is well known. For example, industry sources at leading U.S. AI labs told CSIS that they have also focused on recruiting talent, especially compute infrastructure engineers, with experience in the high-frequency trading industry. Both sectors pay such talented individuals handsomely. DeepSeek’s recent technological achievements (reflected in the DeepSeek-V2 , DeepSeek-V3 , DeepSeek-R1 , DeepSeek Math , and Native Sparse Attention technical papers) can most easily be understood through two basic facts: First, DeepSeek has demonstrated a suite of algorithmic and architectural improvements that significantly reduce the amount of computing power (and therefore financial investment) required for any AI model to reach and operate at a given level of performance. This is true for both the training stage (in which AI models are created) and the inference stage (in which their capabilities are used to serve internal or external customers). Second, DeepSeek has now developed AI models in China that are broadly comparable to the best U.S.-developed AI models introduced in mid-2024 (e.g., OpenAI’s o1 or Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet ). Of the two demonstrations, the fact that these advances came from China is more surprising than the fact that they happened at all. DeepSeek’s improvements in technical performance were consistent with preexisting trend lines of AI performance improvements. They represent expected performance breakthroughs, not shocking ones. To understand why, it is helpful to consider an analogy in the form of Moore’s Law. In economic terms , Moore’s Law essentially means that computer chips improve to be roughly twice as good in performance for the same amount of money roughly every two years. Though the nature of that performance improvement has changed, this trend has been consistently observed for almost six decades (with some caveats ). As Moore’s Law has been repeatedly validated since the 1960s, it has become steadily easier to confidently predict that computing performance per dollar will continue to double every two years. But, as the fortunes of Intel vividly demonstrate, that is not synonymous with being able to state with confidence which specific company or which specific technical innovations will deliver that improved performance. The same is true of AI today: It is easier to forecast the degree of AI performance growth than to forecast who will invent that performance growth or how. AI has its own versions of Moore’s Law that are driving exponential growth in both absolute performance and performance available at a given cost. At a high level, these sources of improvement can be grouped into three types: Epoch AI, an AI-focused nonprofit research institute, has estimated that, while the amount of human-generated training data will likely plateau in 2028, algorithmic and architectural improvements and increased computing resources have been improving at 3x per year and 4.6x per year respectively—for a combined multiplier effect of 13.8x per year. In short, AI performance is increasing at a rate far faster than the familiar (though still extraordinary) pace of exponential progress described by Moore’s Law. Even ignoring the possible remaining improvements from harvesting additional training data, a (highly oversimplified) back-of-the-envelope estimate of future performance based on the compute trends and algorithmic architectural trends would suggest that AI performance at the end of 2028 will be more than 36,000 times better than at the beginning of 2025, rather than just the four or eight times better that would be true if improvement were only occurring at the familiar pace of Moore’s Law. For those who only began paying attention to AI with the late 2022 launch of ChatGPT, this pace of progress can be both breathtaking and difficult to believe. However, for those familiar with the AI industry’s history over the past two decades, the fact that an AI model that requires a massive data center one year can run on a laptop or a single AI chip a few years later is well-known as a recurring , though still quite incredible, phenomenon. The dramatic reduction in cost-per-performance DeepSeek demonstrated is not a surprise to Western AI researchers. They have been leaders in driving—and benefitting from—the exact same trend for more than a decade. One might ask: “If that is the case, why are U.S. AI labs still building ever larger and more powerful data centers?” Put simply, such companies are reinvesting all efficiency gains toward improved overall performance. Dario Amodei, CEO of the U.S. AI lab Anthropic, put it this way : Because the value of having a more intelligent system is so high, this [reduced cost] shifting of the curve typically causes companies to spend more , not less, on training models: the gains in cost efficiency end up entirely devoted to training smarter models, limited only by the company’s financial resources. Moreover, AI researchers are clearly nowhere near the absolute ceiling of computational performance and efficiency. The human brain is a real-world existence proof of human-level intelligence that requires only 20 watts of electricity, compared to the megawatts or gigawatts contemplated for future AI data centers. Despite the many differences between human brains and machine intelligence, the existence of the brain hints at future intelligence efficiency possibilities in much the same way that bird wings inspired the Wright brothers. Thus, it is not at all surprising that somewhere on earth, an AI research lab managed to deliver the improved AI performance-per-dollar that DeepSeek’s technical papers demonstrate. The only surprise is that the research lab that discovered some of the relevant technical innovations is a Chinese one, and notably one whose technical team appears to have been educated and trained almost entirely in China, rather than at Western universities or Western companies. While Chinese researchers have been at or close to world class in many domains of AI research for many years, DeepSeek represents the first time that a Chinese AI lab has demonstrated breakthroughs at or near the absolute frontier of foundational AI research. Many of the techniques that DeepSeek demonstrated are now the new state-of-the-art. Of note, this is exactly what the Chinese government set as a goal in China’s 2017 official AI strategy : By 2025, China will achieve major breakthroughs in basic theories for AI, such that some technologies and applications achieve a world-leading level and AI becomes the main driving force for China’s industrial upgrading and economic transformation. In the first week after the publication of DeepSeek’s R1 paper, some commentators argued that DeepSeek’s results were fabricated as part of a Chinese propaganda effort or “psyop.” This is simply false. Researchers at U.S. universities have already reproduced some of the research results described in the DeepSeek V3 and R1 papers, and U.S. AI firms are already working on adapting DeepSeek’s novel techniques to utilize them in their own AI efforts. As will be discussed further in this paper, essentially all DeepSeek’s technical innovations relate to algorithmic and architectural improvements. DeepSeek did not have superior computing hardware, nor did they have access to uniquely important datasets (excluding synthetic data) that might have provided an advantage over Western researchers. The key technical innovations that DeepSeek demonstrated across the DeepSeek-V2 (May 2024), DeepSeek-V3 (December 2024), DeepSeek-R1 (January 2025), and other research papers are significant. Some of these innovations had already been independently discovered by U.S. firms (and not disclosed publicly), but others were genuinely new. Many media and policy commentators in the United States and China have argued that DeepSeek’s efficiency gains are evidence that U.S. export controls have failed to restrain China’s AI sector and that DeepSeek proves that huge numbers of cutting-edge U.S. AI chips are not required for developing and serving high-performance AI capabilities. There is some merit to aspects of the first claim, but the second is wrong. To begin, DeepSeek’s V3 research paper states that their models were trained on 2,788,000 GPU-hours using Nvidia H800 chips, which, at an estimated cost of 2 dollars per GPU-hour, equates to $5.576 million. The H800 is a degraded version of the H100 chip that Nvidia specifically developed for the Chinese market to comply with the U.S. export controls imposed on October 7, 2022 . In particular, those controls restricted the sale of chips that exceeded performance thresholds across two metrics: total processing power and interconnect speed. Government sources told CSIS that the U.S. government knew that these restrictions would prevent Nvidia from shipping its (at the time) market-leading A100 chip and upcoming H100 chips. They inferred that Chinese customers would be restricted to using the V100, which was first introduced in 2017 and has significantly lower performance than its successors. Additionally, the U.S. government assumed that, if Nvidia were to develop a new chip specifically for the Chinese market that exceeded export control performance thresholds in one metric but not the other, this would require the typical multiyear AI chip development timeline. What the U.S. government architects of the October 2022 export control policy did not realize, however, was that Nvidia had a mechanism for post-manufacturing modification of its existing chip products. Specifically, each Nvidia chip is designed for redundancy, recoverability, and defect tolerance to minimize the impact of manufacturing defects. Such defects are a significant concern in the advanced node semiconductor industry, and designing chips to mitigate their potential impact is near universal. Nvidia can blow one or more strategically placed electrical fuses on the chip so that a manufacturing defect would usually only reduce the chip’s performance or deactivate a redundant component, rather than rendering the entire chip nonfunctional. Industry sources confirmed to CSIS that Nvidia blew fuses on A100 chips to reduce their interconnect speed (but not their processing power) below the export control performance thresholds, thus creating the A800 product lines. In essence, the A100 was born with the capability to become an A800 if needed, via fuse settings. The H800, by contrast, did involve some minor Nvidia re-engineering and design optimization in the face of export controls. This allowed Nvidia to continue shipping large volumes of advanced AI chips (with performance near the global state of the art) to China without violating export controls and without taking multiple years to design new chips specifically for the Chinese market. According to reporting by The Information , the performance of the A800 and H800 chips was close enough to the performance of the originals that there was effectively no demand for large-scale AI chip smuggling to China during the period in which A800s and H800s were available. Why smuggle when the legally purchased chips are good enough? The Biden administration ultimately realized that continued sales of the A800 and H800 meant that their policy would not have the intended impact on China’s AI ecosystem. Former government officials told CSIS that this was clear internally by December 2022. However, it took the administration 12 months after their initial package of export controls to act. The U.S. government modified the export control performance thresholds in October 2023 to block exports of A800s, H800s, and any non-Nvidia chips with comparable performance to China. During the year-long period in which A800 and H800 chip exports to China were legal, an enormous number of them were sold to China. Precise sales figures are not available, but Nvidia’s disclosed sales to China between October 31, 2022, and October 31, 2023, exceeded 9 billion dollars. This does include revenue for chips that were not widely used in AI training or inference, however. See Table 1 for Nvidia’s quarterly revenue by billing locations. If DeepSeek were to admit that it used H100s in its data center to train its models, it would be confessing to activity illegal under U.S. law, since the H100 has never been legally available in China and cannot even legally be purchased by Chinese-firm subsidiaries outside of China. Thus, if DeepSeek did engage in illegal activity, it would have an incentive to conceal this fact. This raises the question of whether DeepSeek lied in its publications when it claimed to have used H800 chips exclusively. Industry analyst Ben Thompson has pointed to strong evidence that DeepSeek did in fact use H800s as it claimed: Many of DeepSeek’s algorithmic and architectural improvements are ideal for maximizing the effective use of computing resources under conditions of limited interconnect bandwidth. At a minimum, this strongly suggests that DeepSeek uses many H800s in its computing infrastructure and that a model with the performance of V3 can indeed be trained exclusively on H800s. This does not prove, however, that DeepSeek exclusively uses H800s in its overall computing infrastructure. Indeed, some reporting in Chinese news media claims that DeepSeek did train its slightly more recent R1 model on Nvidia H100 chips that are banned from China under U.S. export controls. The semiconductor consulting firm SemiAnalysis, citing anonymous industry sources, recently wrote that DeepSeek has a total of 50,000 Hopper generation GPUs, a category that includes H100s, H800s, and H20s. SemiAnalysis specifically claimed that it has evidence that High-Flyer’s/DeepSeek’s computing infrastructure includes at least 10,000 H100s, 10,000 H800s, 30,000 H20s, and 10,000 A100s as part of its total computing stack. SemiAnalysis further estimated that High-Flyer/DeepSeek spent $1.63 billion in GPU server capital expenditures alone (i.e., excluding other data center construction and operating costs). Nathan Lambert, a machine learning researcher at the Allen Institute of Artificial Intelligence, has correctly pointed out that Tracking the compute used for a project just off the final pretraining run is a very unhelpful way to estimate actual cost. It’s a very useful measure for understanding the actual utilization of the compute and the efficiency of the underlying learning , but assigning a cost to the model based on the market price for the GPUs used for the final run is deceptive. In this case, it is not DeepSeek that is being deceptive, however, since their paper was extremely clear about what was and was not included in the $5.6 million figure. It was only the final, successful pretraining run. It did not include the compute cost of the hundreds of experiments that were run beforehand to generate the insights necessary for that final run, nor did it include the compute costs associated with post-training fine-tuning or inference compute workloads. While there is no public evidence that large-scale Nvidia chip smuggling occurred prior to October 2023, industry sources told CSIS that, by early 2024, large-scale H100 chip smuggling operations were underway. In mid-2024, journalists at The Information interviewed participants in eight distinct H100 smuggling networks, each of which provided evidence that they had completed Chinese transactions worth more than $100 million. These networks continue to be active, with increasingly sophisticated techniques for evading detection. For example, a December 2024 investigation by The Information found that When notified of an upcoming inspection, smugglers have duplicated the serial numbers of the servers with Nvidia chips they’ve purchased from Supermicro [and already smuggled to China] and attached them to other servers they had access to. There is some evidence that governments are becoming more serious about cracking down on AI chip smuggling. Singapore was the billing location for 18 percent of Nvidia’s revenue in the most recently concluded fiscal year but the shipping location for only 2 percent of revenue. Officials in Singapore recently arrested three individuals accused of facilitating AI chip smuggling to China. The Singaporean government’s increased emphasis on cracking down on smuggling may reflect its concerns about being relegated to tier 2 status under the Biden administration’s AI Diffusion Framework . As with the introduction of Huawei’s Mate60 Pro 5G smartphone in August 2023, many commentators were quick to highlight how DeepSeek reflected the failure of U.S. export controls. This included Chinese state-owned media, one outlet of which, GlobalVision , broadcast that “DeepSeek and Huawei join forces! . . . breaking through U.S. tech restrictions is not impossible!” Angela Zhang, a professor at the Gould School of Law, went further, arguing : China’s achievements in efficiency are no accident. They are a direct response to the escalating export restrictions imposed by the US and its allies. By limiting China’s access to advanced AI chips, the US has inadvertently spurred its innovation. This argument is in one sense true: Chinese firms like DeepSeek prioritized innovation in efficiency—and particularly efficiency innovations that are useful given the limitations of the H800—because that was the most attractive AI research path available to them. However, this argument is deeply flawed for three reasons. First, every leading AI firm, including both U.S. and Chinese ones, is pursuing enhanced efficiency. As mentioned above, DeepSeek’s efficiency improvements represented a continuation of preexisting industry trends in AI computation efficiency improvements, not a drastic acceleration of them. Even before DeepSeek was founded, and even before the U.S. imposed export controls, DeepSeek’s parent company was obsessively focused on improving computing efficiency (though more focused on optimizing latency). It is strange to say that export controls caused AI firms to do something that they—both U.S. and Chinese—were already doing (and already had a massive financial incentive to do) before export controls were imposed. Second, the argument is flawed because it does not engage with the question of “how much further along might China be in the absence of export controls?” The largest AI computing cluster currently operating on Earth is xAI’s Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, which was recently upgraded to use 200,000 H100 chips . Given that leading Chinese firms were already producing more AI-related patents, publishing nearly as many highly cited research papers, and spending nearly as much on data center capital expenditures before the export controls went into effect, it is entirely possible that China would already be ahead of the United States in AI in the absence of export controls. Jimmy Goodrich, a non-resident senior associate at the Wadhwani AI Center, put it well when he said , “It’s been long known that DeepSeek has a really good team, and if they had access to even more compute, God knows how capable they would be.” Goodrich’s statement on DeepSeek applies to China as a whole. Third, this argument does not take account of the benefits of reallocating the supply of high-performance chips that would otherwise have gone to China. Nvidia, which is estimated to have 90 percent global market share in AI chips, is supply constrained, not demand constrained. For every Nvidia chip that TSMC has been able to manufacture since 2022, there are many customers willing to buy them. Larry Ellison, the cofounder of Oracle, colorfully described how Nvidia’s customers have to beg for greater chip allocation in September 2024 when he recounted a dinner between himself, xAI CEO Elon Musk, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang: I would describe the dinner as Oracle—me and Elon begging Jensen for GPUs, [saying] “Please take our money. Please take our money. By the way, I got dinner. No, no, take more of it. We need you to take more of our money please.” What this means is that, since the AI chip shortage began in 2022, all the chips that Nvidia would have sold to China in the absence of export controls would have come at the expense of customers elsewhere, which in this case is overwhelmingly the United States. In other words, eliminating the export controls would have not only helped China, it would have also hurt the United States, at least in terms of Nvidia chip allocation. For his part, DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng is under no illusions that the chip export controls have helped China or DeepSeek. In a July 2024 interview, he said , “We do not have financing plans in the short term. Money has never been the problem for us; bans on shipments of advanced chips are the problem.” Liang has also said in an interview with a Chinese media outlet that U.S. restrictions on AI chips mean that Chinese companies must use two to four times the computing power to achieve the same results, referring to the penalty of using the H800 instead of the H100 for large model training. Further evidence of the impact of U.S. export controls comes from the fact that DeepSeek experienced widespread outages and had to halt new user sign-ups in the wake of its massive user adoption growth. While DeepSeek claimed that the outages were the result of cyberattacks, the far more likely explanation is that they simply lacked sufficient computing capacity to serve their growing user base. There is a big difference between the amount of computing power required to serve an AI large language model to a small number of users and doing what OpenAI does, which is serve its AI models to 400 million active users every week. More recently, DeepSeek has once again reopened new user sign-ups, which likely reflects the company successfully purchasing or renting additional computing capacity. Nevertheless, the point remains: Compute capacity matters. In describing its goals toward creating AGI, a recent DeepSeek job advertisement said that “We believe AGI is the violent beauty of model x data x computing power.” Though a bit oversimplified, that formula is still essentially correct and helps explain why having larger computing resources is a useful advantage at any level of computational efficiency. All of DeepSeek’s innovations were algorithmic and architectural. DeepSeek appears to have described all or nearly all of them in great detail in its research papers. That means that U.S. AI labs are free to apply these same innovations in training and deploying their own AI models. Indeed, U.S. firms are already doing so . But while DeepSeek’s algorithmic innovations are replicable by U.S. firms, DeepSeek will struggle to replicate U.S. AI chip and compute advantages. In the absence of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) technology, China’s most advanced AI chip designer and logic chip manufacturer, Huawei and SMIC, respectively, will most likely remain stuck at 7 nanometers (nm) or perhaps a flawed 5 nm technology node for many years. The CEO of ASML, which is the sole firm in the world manufacturing EUV lithography machines, said “By banning the export of EUV, China will lag 10 to 15 years behind the West. That really has an effect.” By contrast, U.S. chip firms such as Nvidia will in coming years press forward past the 4 nm era into the 2 nm and beyond future, delivering chips that might be thousands or tens of thousands of times better performing integrated into data centers using tens or hundreds of times more chips. While there are still many ways in which the U.S. government could bungle export control implementation and enforcement—which will be discussed later in this paper—the greatest potential for impacts from the export controls are still well ahead in the future as the United States races forward and China’s progress continues to slow. Implemented properly, they offer the opportunity for a meaningful, though far from permanent, edge over China. Much of the initial commentary on DeepSeek suggested that demand for AI chips might plummet, as efficiency improvements meant that fewer chips were needed to achieve the same level of intelligence. While this is a generally accurate description of efficiency, it is a terrible description of how computing economics works. As mentioned above, Moore’s Law has driven a more than billionfold improvement in computing efficiency over the past seven decades. Does this mean that all of the world’s computing needs are handled by a single computer that costs only a fraction of a penny? Of course not. Instead, the increased efficiency has made applying digital computation throughout the economy far more attractive, and so more governments, businesses, and consumers have invested in more computation across countless applications and use cases. This is the essence of Jevon’s Paradox , which describes how increasing efficiency can increase aggregate demand. The same is obviously going to be true of increased AI computational efficiency. Indeed, after the DeepSeek revelations, the largest data center buyers in the world—Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon— announced that they were going to spend hundreds of billions of dollars in 2025 on AI chips and data centers, up by nearly 50 percent over the already record amount invested in 2024. Chinese firms such as Alibaba have announced that they too will make massive chip purchases in the wake of DeepSeek. Nor is this merely a long-term phenomenon. Even in the short term, rental prices for H100 chips hosted by Amazon’s cloud computing spiked upward in the wake of DeepSeek’s publication as customers worked to incorporate DeepSeek models into their operations. More recently, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that OpenAI would have to temporarily limit usage of its GPT 4.5 model because the company did not have sufficient GPUs to meet all of the demand. Moreover, there is almost certainly no “ceiling” for a desirable amount of intelligence and the computing required to power that intelligence. Miles Brundage, who previously led policy research at OpenAI, described it this way: To make a human-AI analogy, consider [Albert] Einstein or John von Neumann as the smartest possible person you could fit in a human brain. You would still want more of them. You’d want more copies. That’s basically what inference compute or test-time compute is—copying the smart thing. It’s better to have an hour of Einstein’s time than a minute, and I don’t see why that wouldn’t be true for AI. This again relates to how the most significant impacts of the export controls are likely in the future, as the evermore extremely scaled deployment of evermore powerful chips begins to bear fruit. It is the next few rounds of increasing AI computation—by tenfold, a hundredfold, a thousandfold—where China will be most severely blocked and the impact of the export controls will be most severely felt. Some Chinese AI researchers have made similar points. On February 13, 2025, Li Guojie, a scholar at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, told Chinese media outlet ChinaFund that DeepSeek’s success represents a step-change in Chinese AI capabilities but said that “due to the blockade of the U.S. government, China is currently unable to obtain the most advanced chip process technology.” Li went on to say [machine translation]: The success of DeepSeek does not deny the key role of computing power in the development of artificial intelligence. In fact, since there are much more equipment for reasoning than for training, the computing power required for reasoning [aka inference] will become the main requirement in the future. It is very important to improve the efficiency of the model through algorithm optimization. It is our basic choice to take the green development path of saving computing power, but computing power is definitely a necessary condition for solving artificial intelligence problems and cannot be ignored. On January 29, OpenAI told the New York Times that We know that groups in the P.R.C. are actively working to use methods, including what’s known as distillation, to replicate advanced U.S. A.I. models. . . . We are aware of and reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models. Distillation is a well-known technique that allows “the transfer of knowledge from a larger, more complex language model (the ‘teacher’) to a smaller, more efficient version (the ‘student’).” In short, the inputs and outputs from the teacher model are used as very high-quality synthetic training data by the student model. Distillation is utilized by every major U.S. AI lab to offer smaller, more efficient versions of its models that are faster and cheaper to serve to customers. For example, GPT-4o-mini is the distilled version of GPT-4o, and both were made by OpenAI. There are multiple types of distillation, however, and the more advanced types, which AI labs use to distill their own models, require access to the internals of the models. While a firm distilling its own models is clearly harmless, there is a strategic consideration if one firm can distill another firm’s models, incurring most or all of the benefits of acquiring a highly capable AI model while incurring far fewer of the costs of creating such a model. In the case of OpenAI and DeepSeek, the distillation evidence appears quite strong: DeepSeek’s initially released models, when asked by users “what model are you?,” will often respond , “I’m ChatGPT.” DeepSeek’s updated versions of the model, likely modified using fine-tuning techniques, no longer produce such responses, but this does not reduce the strength of the evidence that DeepSeek relied on distillation. Such unauthorized distillation would be a violation of OpenAI’s terms of service, but the law firm Fenwick has written that “whether remedies against such [a Terms of Service] breach would sufficiently protect teacher-model owner’s IP remains to be determined.” If OpenAI were to file a lawsuit against DeepSeek, for example, perhaps it would win in U.S. courts. But how would the size of judicial penalties compare to the strategic benefit for DeepSeek as a firm or for China as a country? And the access to judicial remedies is almost certainly limited to the United States and other countries with strong intellectual property protections. Even if DeepSeek were hypothetically clearly guilty of not only distillation but an even more extreme case of outright corporate espionage, Chinese courts would likely find OpenAI guilty of stealing IP from DeepSeek rather than the reverse. This is what happened to U.S. chipmaker Micron when it accused China’s Fujian Jinhua of stealing memory chip trade secrets and when U.S. prosecutors charged Fujian Jinhua with economic espionage. In retaliation, Jinhua sued Micron in a Chinese court for patent infringement in early 2018. The Fuzhou Intermediate People’s Court in Fujian province sided with the Chinese side and issued an injunction blocking Micron from selling 26 chip products in China. Similarly, when U.S. semiconductor equipment firm Veeco found that a Chinese competitor, Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment (AMEC), was using Veeco’s proprietary designs, Veeco secured a preliminary injunction in a U.S. court to stop a supplier from providing parts to AMEC. However, in response, AMEC filed a patent suit in China, and the Fujian High Court (the same province as above) acted with remarkable speed. On December 7, 2017—just weeks after AMEC’s filing—the court granted AMEC a preliminary injunction without even hearing Veeco’s defense. Thus, one should separate the questions of what is “fair” or “true” from what the strategic consequences are likely to be. Neither geopolitics nor business is a contest where first prize always goes to the most innovative. Many companies, including U.S. tech companies , have a perfectly viable business strategy of closely monitoring their innovative competitors and then either buying the competitor or replicating its innovation. Chinese firms can do the same, including in ways that both do and do not violate intellectual property. Thus, the meaningful strategic question for OpenAI and other U.S. AI firms is not whether DeepSeek is failing to play by the rules, it is whether U.S. firms have a mechanism for effectively preventing DeepSeek or any competitor from extracting the benefits of an AI lab’s investments without bearing the costs. What enduring sources of competitive advantages could the large U.S. AI labs secure if Chinese companies or other copycats (potentially even U.S. ones) can simply piggyback off their work to build cheaper and equivalently good models while incurring only a fraction of the costs? One possible answer comes in the form of Meta’s strategy, which is to invest in developing open-source AI models justified not by the direct benefits of increasing monthly subscriptions, but by the indirect benefits of enhancing their existing social media and advertising business lines. Among the worst outcomes for U.S. AI companies would be if the fundamentals of AI research and development were structurally similar to those of the global pharmaceutical industry. In 2023, the top 20 global pharmaceutical companies invested approximately $2.4 billion over 10 to 15 years into developing a typical new drug from start to finish. The costs of research and development dwarf those of drug manufacturing, marketing, and distribution, so the final price of the product must reflect the costs of research and development for pharmaceutical firms to have any hope of recovering their investments and earning a profit. To incentivize drug R&D, the U.S. government offers companies 20-year patents that allow them the exclusive right to sell their products in the United States at a monopoly premium to recover upfront R&D costs. However, once a patent expires, so-called generic manufacturers can reproduce and sell the same drug for a far lower price—avoiding the burden of R&D costs altogether. Generic manufacturers can thereafter compete by selling identical drugs while incurring only a tiny fraction of the costs faced by the original drug developer. In a world where there was no patent protection on new pharmaceuticals, investment in new drug discovery (and thus the pace of innovative new drugs) would be radically limited because governments and philanthropic actors might be the only ones willing to invest, and they would almost certainly do so at far lower levels than the current private sector does. Government and business-makers alike must now ask the question: What if frontier AI model research is structurally identical to that of the pharmaceutical industry, meaning extremely high upfront R&D costs and very low replication costs? The implications for AI investment and for U.S.-China AI competition could be significant. The U.S.-China AI race is very likely not one in which gentlemanly concepts of “fairness” matter. Chinese companies have systematically stolen American IP for years and will almost certainly continue to do so. Beyond Chinese firms, the Chinese government has a very clear history of either not enforcing or outright supporting Chinese firms that illegally violate U.S. patents in cases where the Chinese government has identified the industry as strategically significant. AI certainly falls into that category. Kai-Fu Lee, arguably the top venture capitalist in China’s AI sector, wrote in his 2018 book AI Superpowers that imitation does not have the same stigma in China that it does in the United States. He went further to argue that China’s unabashed willingness to copy innovation and even ignore intellectual property makes its companies more competitive, not less. In describing the post-2010 rise of hypercompetitive and cutthroat Chinese tech firms as “copycat gladiators,” Lee’s writing on this topic is worth quoting at length: Silicon Valley may have found the copying undignified and the tactics unsavory. In many cases, it was. But it was precisely this widespread cloning—the onslaught of thousands of mimicking competitors—that forced companies to innovate. Survival in the internet coliseum required relentlessly iterating products, controlling costs, executing flawlessly, generating positive PR [public relations], raising money at exaggerated valuations, and seeking ways to build a robust business ‘moat’ to keep the copycats out. Pure copycats never made for great companies, and they couldn’t survive inside this coliseum. But the trial-by-fire competitive landscape created when one is surrounded by ruthless copycats had the result of forging a generation of the most tenacious entrepreneurs on earth. As we enter the age of AI implementation, this cutthroat entrepreneurial environment will be one of China’s core assets in building a machine-learning-driven economy. Taking Lee’s argument one step further: If the future global competitive landscape for AI is one of ruthless copying in the absence of robust intellectual property protections, that is an environment where Chinese entrepreneurs ought to do extremely well, because it resembles the domestic Chinese tech ecosystem in which they grew up and thrived. Even over just the past three years, a diverse set of examples suggests that robustly protecting key knowledge in the AI field is likely to be extremely difficult: If you know which research dead ends to avoid (e.g., MCTS) and roughly know what research direction to pursue, replication is much easier. These algorithmic insights likely slowly leaked through SF party conversations and other channels. It probably takes a few months once you have the idea for [OpenAI’s reasoning AI model] o1 to replicate it. That’s how DeepSeek did it without much compute. While there is ongoing research into techniques to prevent model distillation, and AI companies will no doubt increase these efforts in the wake of DeepSeek, this remains an open question with significant implications. In an interview published in ChinaTalk , Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said , Like all problems in cybersecurity . . . [distillation is] going to be an ongoing issue. That’s why some companies have chosen to kind of hide the chain of thought in their reasoning models, because it makes it much harder to distill. Those can be jailbroken. But folks are working on antidotes to jailbreaking. We just released something today that makes it much harder to jailbreak models . Even in a case where distillation and more explicit cases of technological espionage are difficult or impossible to prevent, however, there will remain the issue inference computation, which involves applying more computational resources so that the model can “think” harder about the answer to a question or so that the model can be used more times and serve more users. One way of thinking about this is that the nature of competitive advantage in AI could be shifting from a secret that one keeps (i.e., the model weights ) toward an asset that one controls (i.e., massive data center compute infrastructure). This means that export controls—if implemented and enforced effectively—still have an opportunity to have a strategic impact. Nevertheless, the U.S. government and U.S. AI firms need to take a tough look at whether and how they can remain competitive in a world where China does not respect intellectual property and is committed to devoting enormous state resources to technical espionage in the AI and semiconductor sectors. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) at the U.S. Department of Commerce is the agency charged with adjudicating license applications and enforcing export controls, not just on semiconductors bound for China, but for all U.S. dual-use technology exports that might end up in Russia, Iran, North Korea, and many other restricted destinations. To implement its work overseeing trillions of dollars in economic activity and policing smuggling operations worldwide, BIS has fewer than 600 employees and a relatively paltry budget of just under $200 million. Semiconductors are just one technology category out of hundreds that this organization is responsible for enforcing. Reporting by The Information found at least eight Chinese AI chip–smuggling networks, with each engaging in transactions valued at more than $100 million. More recent reporting by the Wall Street Journal suggests that this smuggling now includes the latest generation of Nvidia Blackwell AI chips. China is betting that its network of smugglers and shell companies can find the leaks in the BIS export control enforcement barrier. As long as Congress continues to neglect BIS by providing grossly inadequate resources compared to the size and importance of its mission, China has a reasonable expectation of success. BIS needs not only more money, but also more skilled staff, more enforcement agents, and better enabling technology, especially in data analysis . Moreover, the Department of Commerce needs more help from the rest of the government, in particular the U.S. intelligence community. Declassified Central Intelligence Agency documents show that the intelligence community was deeply involved in assisting export control enforcement during the Cold War and delivered solid results by doing so. These are capabilities and priorities that have significantly atrophied in the post–Cold War era but urgently need to be restored. Recent efforts by the Trump administration to reduce government spending risk making a bad situation worse. On February 5, 2025, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi signed a Department of Justice memorandum that, among many other actions, disbanded the National Security Division’s Corporate Enforcement Unit, which was “created with the goal of investigating and prosecuting corporate actors involved in sanctions evasion, export control violations, and other national security-related economic crimes.” The memo did not provide any explanation for how the duties of the unit would be performed elsewhere in the Department of Justice, which could mean that this will be implemented as a straightforward reduction in U.S. government capacity to enforce export controls. Of all the choices available, the worst policy choice that the U.S. government could make is to regulate aggressively but with large loopholes and weak enforcement. Such an approach—which fairly describes the approach taken in the first Trump administration and large chunks of the Biden administration—incurs nearly all the costs of an aggressive export control policy but does so without providing any of the possible strategic benefits in terms of slowing Chinese progress in semiconductors and AI. As described above, the nature of AI geopolitical advantage appears to be moving away from software secrets that are difficult to protect and toward hardware chip and data center assets that are (hopefully) easier to protect. In this sense, DeepSeek is not in and of itself the most significant threat to U.S. leadership in AI. Instead, the greater challenge arises from the possibility of China having a domestic ecosystem for producing its own AI chips at large scale and integrating them into Chinese data center training, as well as running inference for DeepSeek and other AI models. As U.S. technology firms are planning hundreds of billions of dollars in AI data center infrastructure investments, it is worth remembering that—for those investments to be possible—companies like TSMC must manufacture enough AI chips to fill those data centers. In the case of companies such as Nvidia, their revenue growth in recent years is less than it would have otherwise been due to shortages of TSMC production capacity. The Biden administration took many steps designed to definitively cut China’s AI chip designers off from TSMC production capacity. Most recently, on January 15, the Commerce Department announced the final tranche of Biden administration export controls, often referred to as “the Foundry Rule.” The Foundry Rule moved advanced chip production to a white-list system that will likely make it impossible for Chinese AI firms to access TSMC capacity to produce chips above export control performance thresholds even when operating through complex shell company arrangements. However, as discussed below, TSMC manufactured a strategically significant quantity of chips on behalf of Huawei via shell companies prior to the rule going into effect. That effectively means that China’s long-term future in AI is closely tied to its ability to produce AI chips domestically. The Biden administration sought to hamstring China’s domestic production of advanced chips by restricting the sale of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, including from other countries. Historically, one of the biggest sources of competitive advantage for Nvidia has been its CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) software ecosystem. CUDA makes it much easier for programmers to write massively parallelized software (as all modern AI software is) and ensures backward and forward compatibility so that older chips can still run newer software and vice versa. Any customer who seeks to stop using Nvidia chips has to leave the CUDA ecosystem, which requires solving a lot of incredibly hard software problems for which CUDA already provides free answers. Those free answers reflect billions of dollars of investment in the CUDA platform by both Nvidia and its customers. DeepSeek stands out among AI model developers because it implemented software changes below the CUDA level. Most AI researchers rely on CUDA, a higher-level programming language for NVIDIA GPUs, because it simplifies the development process. However, CUDA does not allow fine-grained control over GPU operations at the level DeepSeek required. DeepSeek modified software instructions written in a language called PTX (Parallel Thread Execution). By programming directly in PTX, DeepSeek engineers were able to optimize how the GPU handled specific workloads, particularly in managing expert specialization in the Mixture-of-Experts model and improving memory efficiency. This is an “assembly-level” approach to GPU programming—one that is both extremely difficult and (at least historically) rarely attempted. The trade-off, however, was a major increase in performance efficiency, particularly for large-scale AI training tasks. This suggests that DeepSeek may have both the technical knowledge and the open-source community enthusiasm to finally start generating momentum around Huawei’s competitor to CUDA, which Huawei refers to as its Compute Architecture for Neural Networks (CANN). The greater maturity of the CUDA software ecosystem currently makes Nvidia chips more attractive, but this could change over the next few years. If it does, it would have major implications for Nvidia’s competitiveness both inside and outside of China. At present, the combination of Ascend chips (discussed more below) and CANN software appears far from being competitive to CUDA. A Financial Times report from September 2024 found that even Huawei employees found the product “difficult and unstable to use” and prone to crashing frequently. Industry sources told CSIS that DeepSeek’s more recent evaluation of CANN was very negative and that DeepSeek assessed that it would be years before the combination of Ascend chips and CANN-compatible software was a viable alternative. Still, this could change with time, effort, and investment. Huawei recently joined the open-source PyTorch foundation in an effort to increase Ascend and CANN compatibility of the PyTorch AI development framework. There is at least one meaningful precedent regarding the difficulty of leaving the Nvidia CUDA ecosystem, which is Google’s shift from TensorFlow on Nvidia GPUs to JAX on their proprietary chips, called TPUs. In this case, it took several years for JAX to mature and for a critical mass of software libraries to appear—even with heavy Google investment and the payoff opportunity in terms of both efficiency and competitive differentiation. Even by 2023, Google was still heavily investing to improve JAX (for example, addressing pain points like multi-host setup and memory efficiency) and encouraging its use through education (tutorials, conference workshops). For a company like DeepSeek, migrating all AI workloads from CUDA to CANN would likely be a multiyear project. Google’s internal shift took 2–3 years to bear significant fruit, and even then Google maintained support for both for a long while. Domestically producing large quantities of AI chips will require China to domestically replicate multiple segments of the AI chip value chain. The most important links are AI chip design, advanced node logic chip manufacturing, and advanced node high-bandwidth memory (HBM) manufacturing. Each of these will be addressed in turn. Like the United States, China has many different companies working on AI chip design, including Huawei, Cambricon, Biren, and more. However, Huawei is unambiguously in the strongest position with its Ascend AI chip product line. Industry sources also told CSIS that Huawei—due to its highly influential position with the Chinese government and its size as a customer—has the greatest leverage over SMIC. In other words, even if Huawei were not the best AI chip designer in China, it would still be the most important since it is in a position to restrict the share of SMIC manufacturing capacity that goes toward its domestic competitors. Huawei has been a player in the AI chip market for longer than is generally realized. Huawei had a 7 nm AI Accelerator chip planned for production at TSMC in 2020 . At the time, Huawei was preparing to capitalize the so-called 3-5-2 policy , in which the CCP’s Central Office ordered all government agencies and many state-owned enterprises to eliminate the use of all non-Chinese technology within three years. However, Huawei was unable to fulfill demand because of the first Trump administration’s updated 2020 entity listing , which temporarily cut Huawei’s Ascend and Kirin lines off from TSMC. In this instance, Nvidia was the beneficiary of these early U.S. export controls, which delivered a setback to Chinese efforts to eliminate dependence on U.S. AI chip technology. Today, Huawei’s Ascend product line is focused on the Ascend 910B and the Ascend 910C, the latter of which includes two Ascend 910B logic dies per integrated unit (meaning more real estate on each silicon wafer is required for manufacturing an Ascend 910C than a 910B). DeepSeek has reportedly evaluated the Ascend chips and found that they are unattractive for training AI models but that each Ascend 910C delivers roughly 60 percent of the performance of an Nvidia H100 for inferencing AI models. This matters greatly since more and more of the computing requirements for advanced AI models are expected to be devoted to inference in the coming years. Barclays, an investment bank, estimates that by 2026, 70 percent of AI compute demand will come from inference. In February 2024, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that utilization of its chips was “40 percent inference, 60 percent training,” compared to 90 percent training-focused in the 2016 timeframe. Chinese firms like Huawei have historically had two major options for manufacturing their AI chip designs: outsource production abroad to TSMC of Taiwan or produce chips domestically in partnership with SMIC. For a time, it seemed as though the 2020 entity listing of Huawei definitively cut the company off from accessing TSMC advanced node manufacturing capacity. The October 2022 and October 2023 export controls were supposed to have done the same for all advanced node AI chip designers in China. However, TSMC manufactured large quantities of Huawei Ascend 910B chips on behalf of Huawei shell companies and shipped the chips to China in violation of U.S. export controls. In an interview with the New York Times , an unnamed Taiwanese official acknowledged that these chips “ended up in the hands of Huawei.” Government officials told CSIS that TSMC manufactured more than 2 million Ascend 910B logic dies and that all of these are now with Huawei. If true, this is enough dies to make 1 million Ascend 910C units. However, the advanced packaging process by which two Ascend 910B dies and HBM are combined into a unified Ascend 910C chip also introduces defects that can compromise the functionality of the chip. Industry sources told CSIS that roughly 75 percent of the Ascend 910Cs currently survive the advanced packaging process. This is a strategically significant stockpile of AI chips. For comparison, Nvidia reportedly shipped 1 million H20 chips (which are inference specialized and targeted at the Chinese market) to China in 2024. Nvidia’s January 26 SEC filing states that it generated $17 billion in revenues from Chinese customers in the most recently ended fiscal year (which would obviously exclude revenues from chips later smuggled to China). Presumably, the vast majority of these revenues are from H20 sales. Even though Huawei likely has the more than 2 million Ascend 910B logic dies made by TSMC, there is a question as to whether it has enough HBM to integrate with those dies in manufacturing 1 million Ascend 910Cs. It seems likely that Huawei does, however, since the U.S. plan to restrict all advanced HBM sales to China on a country-wide basis was leaked to Bloomberg in August 2024 and did not go into effect until December of that year, giving Huawei ample time to legally acquire HBM chips as part of a stockpiling strategy. Industry sources told CSIS that Huawei has stockpiled enough HBM to meet their internal expectations for at least a full year’s worth of production, mostly in the form of purchases from Samsung of South Korea, potentially via shell companies, that occurred before the December controls went into effect. It is as though the U.S. government was having an internal debate about whether or not to have a surprise attack, and in the spirit of compromise, the slow interagency process settled on attacking without the surprise. This was an egregious failure with strategic consequences. With the adoption of the Foundry Rule , it will hopefully be impossible for Huawei or other Chinese AI chip designers to ever again access TSMC manufacturing capacity, even when using sophisticated shell company tactics. Huawei will instead be restricted to what Chinese domestic logic chip manufacturers can produce. However, there is also the potential risk that an existing chip design company on the Foundry Rule white list could be tempted by massive revenue opportunities to act as a pass-through to give Huawei access to TSMC. Guarding against this risk will require making clear to TSMC that the negative consequences of continuing to supply Huawei with advanced AI chips would be colossal compared to the revenue and profit opportunity. Similarly, Huawei may attempt similar tactics with other chip foundries such as Samsung or even Intel. The most advanced logic chip manufacturer in China is SMIC. SMIC’s SN2 facility in Shanghai is the sole facility in China with an active 7 nm logic chip production line and has been producing 7 nm chips since July 2021 , more than a year before the first tranche of the Biden administration’s semiconductor equipment export controls went into effect. SMIC and Huawei are now working to bring a 5 nm node into scaled production but must do so without access to EUV lithography equipment, since China has no local producer of EUV lithography machines and since export controls have prevented such machines from ever being exported to China. Industry sources told CSIS that, in early 2020, ASML was poised to ship EUV tools to China and that SMIC was planning to work with key research labs in Europe, such as the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (IMEC), to help develop their EUV-based manufacturing process. In December 2024, industry sources told CSIS that SMIC currently has enough immersion deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography equipment supplied by the Dutch company ASML to produce 85,000 FinFET wafers per month (WPM) across both SN1 (which focuses on 14 nm node production) and SN2 (which focuses on 7 nm and 5 nm production). This acquisition of lithography tools reportedly took effect before Dutch DUV lithography export controls went into effect in mid-2023. However, the bottleneck in expanding 7 nm (which in SMIC’s node naming system is called “N+2”) production capacity has not been lithography but rather U.S. tools for etching, deposition, inspection, and metrology. The shortage of inspection and metrology tools has also been an important factor preventing SMIC from improving its yield. SMIC acquired lithography equipment as a stockpiling measure in anticipation of future export controls by the Dutch government. Low production rate also has an impact on yield, since manufacturing technicians and engineers tend to improve their techniques based on experimentation and observed results from production. Thus, more production is helpful in accelerating the pace of learning and thus improving the yield. Based on the Ascend 910B die size of 665.61 mm², CSIS estimates that each 300-millimeter diameter silicon wafer produces roughly 80 chip dies. This is simply counting the number of small rectangles (chip dies) that can fit inside the large circle (the wafer). A source told CSIS that of these 80 chip dies: SMIC’s 20 percent yield when producing Ascend 910Bs is quite low, but it is not as low as it might seem. In 2020, when Nvidia moved its GPU production to TSMC’s 7 nm process, the defect-free yield rate was roughly 41.5 percent . Since manufacturing defects occur randomly on a defects per square centimeter of chip area basis, larger chips (such as AI chips) are more susceptible than smaller chips (such as smartphone application processors) to a high defect rate. Using TSMC during roughly the same time period and with roughly the same defect rate, Apple’s A12 processor enjoyed 90 percent+ yield. SMIC also makes the application processor for Huawei’s Mate smartphone line, and its yield when making these smaller chips is somewhere in the 50–70 percent range. However, a February 24, 2025 report by the Financial Times , citing two anonymous individuals, claims that SMIC’s AI chip yield has increased to roughly 40 percent. Industry sources told CSIS that the Financial Times report is not correct and that Huawei/SMIC’s true yield remains at 20 percent. One explanation for the discrepancy would be if the Financial Times’ sources were mistakenly including both the fully functional chips and the chips that are functional but with degraded performance when estimating yield. As mentioned above, SMIC’s shortage of deposition, etching, inspection, and metrology semiconductor manufacturing equipment also been an important factor preventing expanded production capacity of its SN2 facility. Some of this equipment is restricted on a country-wide basis, meaning that it cannot be legally sold anywhere in China. However, other types of this equipment were restricted only on an end-use and end-user basis. This means that the equipment can be sold to some customers in China but not others. In some cases, this even means that it can be sold to some facilities of a particular customer, but not others. In such cases, relocating the equipment from one facility to another would require a new export license in order to be legal. But SMIC’s production of 7 nm chips using U.S. equipment is already illegal , and both SMIC and other Chinese firms always have the option to choose illegal activity, particularly since such activity frequently enjoys the active support of the Chinese government. Industry sources told CSIS that SiEn, Pensun, and Huawei’s fab in Dongguan all were able to legally acquire the needed etching, deposition, and inspection/metrology equipment that SMIC needs for two reasons: (1) the equipment was not restricted on a country-wide basis to all of China and (2) the equipment was restricted on an end-use and end-user basis, but SiEn and Pensun told U.S. firms that it would exclusively be used for producing chips less advanced than 14 nm. These firms also denied any affiliation with Huawei. Government officials told CSIS that in such circumstances, the equipment can often be sold under a no-license required status. According to the sources, SiEn and Pensun, however, did not have sufficient customers providing demand for using all of the equipment they had purchased, and so some of it was never used operationally in their fabs. They purchased the equipment as a stockpiling move in anticipation of future export controls. The source described this as a “buy everything you can, while you can” strategy. The SMIC SN2 facility needed the equipment. Since SiEn and Pensun were not making economically productive use of the equipment, they were amenable to a sale. This sale was negotiated in Q4 of 2024 and completed in Q1 of 2025. The sources are under the impression that all of the desired equipment is currently either installed at SMIC SN2 or on-site awaiting installation. This equipment will eliminate the near-term U.S. equipment bottleneck facing SMIC for SN2 7 nm production. SMIC’s new 7 nm production bottleneck is the overall size of the facility. Prior public statements from SMIC indicated that the SN1 and SN2 facilities combined have a maximum capacity of 85,000 WPM and that SMIC intended to split production evenly between the two facilities, implying SMIC was targeting ~42,500 WPM of lithography capacity at SN2. Sources told CSIS that SMIC was targeting 50,000 WPM of 7 nm specifically by the end of 2025. It is unclear whether this means that 7 nm production will now also take place at SN1 or whether SMIC has figured out a production process and equipment configuration that allows them to squeeze more production capacity than expected into SN2. If, hypothetically, SMIC were to devote all 50,000 WPM to Ascend 910C manufacturing, this would imply producing 4 million Ascend 910B dies per month, of which 800,000 would be fully functional. 800,000 910B Ascend dies is enough to manufacture 400,000 910C chips, though the advanced packaging process would reduce yield further, and it is unclear how much HBM Huawei has on hand. SMIC is unlikely to devote all of its 7 nm capacity to Ascend chips. Huawei needs that 7 nm capacity for its chips for smartphones, laptops, data centers, and telecommunications equipment. Moreover, SMIC has other customers besides Huawei. Still, the point remains that Huawei is likely poised to dramatically expand Ascend production in the near future. Over time, SMIC’s 7 nm yield will likely improve significantly above 20 percent due to the additional equipment and the increased production rate. It will likely not match the best TSMC 7 nm yields for AI chips, however, since TSMC’s best 7 nm yields used EUV, and China has no credible near-term path for acquiring EUV technology. Over the mid and long term, however, Huawei is working aggressively to produce a domestic alternative to ASML EUV technology. Huawei currently has two semiconductor manufacturing equipment tool research facilities, one in Shanghai and one in Shenzhen. According to a report by Nikkei Asia, Huawei is investing $1.66 billion in the Shanghai facility alone and has hired a large number of chip industry veterans with experience working at companies like Applied Materials, Lam Research, KLA, ASML, TSMC, Intel, and Micron. Taylor Ogan, a venture capitalist based in Shenzhen, China, focused on investing in Chinese technology companies, described Huawei’s EUV efforts as follows: There are teams at Huawei in two different parts of China that are working around the clock. . . . They are literally cut off from their friends and family just because the work they are doing is so sensitive, and imagine how quickly they’re going to accelerate Chinese complete domestic chip development. . . . One of them is in Shenzhen. That’s the bigger [EUV lithography] breakthrough lab, and you can look on Google Earth. There was nothing there and now there is something there, and there are thousands of people working there. The other one is around Shanghai and that is more for the next chips in the next phones. So, yeah, the bigger lithography breakthroughs are [being worked on] in Shenzhen. . . . They’re working their asses off. . . . This is like some of the smartest people in the space, and they’re all Chinese. As mentioned above, these secretive efforts underway at Huawei are extremely likely to be benefitting from state-backed industrial espionage, including the cyberattacks on ASML and its partners . A high-quality recent analysis by Nicholas Welch, Lily Ottinger, and Jordan Schneider of ChinaTalk concludes that China’s current compute shortage has more to do with practical challenges and suboptimal deployment—many idle small and medium data centers rather than fewer fully-utilized superclusters—than it does with an absolute shortage of chips. A combination of recent Chinese government policy changes, such as “hand[ing] over their idle computing resources to cloud providers” and strategic moves by China’s largest tech companies to favor DeepSeek models even over their in-house ones, suggests that this could change in the near future. According to reporting by Caijing Magazine , the chips in China most likely to be underutilized are Huawei’s Ascends, which have benefitted in terms of government pressure to buy domestic but remain underutilized because of a lack of useful AI models that are Ascend-compatible. This could change if DeepSeek adapts its models to run on Ascends, which it is reportedly working toward for model inference, though not model training. As mentioned above, sources told CSIS that TSMC has supplied Huawei with enough chip dies to manufacture a million Ascend 910C chips, each of which has roughly 60 percent the performance of an Nvidia H100 when used for inference. With the help of Huawei and the Chinese government, DeepSeek could plausibly succeed in driving a reallocation of the Nvidia H800s and H100s already in China toward itself for construction of a new AI model training data center. This could then be augmented by an additional, much larger cluster of Huawei Ascend 910Cs (or Nvidia H20s) to be used for AI model inference. Such a combination is a plausible, perhaps even likely, path for China to continue making significant progress in its AI development. As discussed above, a million-chip cluster of Huawei Ascends would face the challenge of a shortage of AI models, software, and developer tools that are compatible with Huawei’s CANN software ecosystem. A second challenge is in integrating all of the chips as part of a single cluster where the whole is more than the sum of the parts. Financial Times reporter Eleanor Olcott interviewed one Beijing-based chip investor who said “The bottleneck at the moment isn’t getting the chips but figuring out how to make them work in a cluster. This is really complicated work.” Evidently the true attractiveness of the Huawei Ascend 910C chips is worse than the “60 percent of H100” figure might suggest. As discussed above, in the absence of export controls, it is plausible that Chinese firms would have already surpassed their U.S. competitors in developing and deploying frontier AI models. It is likewise plausible that China might have already succeeded in driving widespread adoption of the Huawei Ascend chips, just as Huawei’s smartphone division, bolstered by internal chip designs, was looking poised to overtake Apple’s iPhone in China prior to the introduction of effective export controls in 2020. The export controls have done much to slow and complicate China’s technological rise and march toward their longstanding objective of technological self-sufficiency. They are still having a significant effect even now and are poised to have even greater impact in the future as U.S. firms benefit from Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell chips and as China likely remains stuck at the 7 nm technology node until and unless they develop a domestic EUV lithography capability. However, China’s successes in substantial government investment, chip smuggling, exploiting gaps in U.S. export control coverage, completing in-country transfers of equipment, hiring talent with experience from leading international firms, reverse-engineering foreign technology, harnessing state-backed economic espionage, and producing genuine domestic innovation are a formidable combination. U.S. firms, working at maximum effort and with the benefit of all their own advantages, will still likely be the first to develop artificial general intelligence or artificial superintelligence. This should not, however, be taken for granted. At a meeting on February 17 between CCP Chairman Xi Jinping and Chinese technology executives, including DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng, Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei told Xi that his previous concerns about the lack of domestic advanced semiconductor production and the damaging impacts of U.S. export controls had eased because of recent breakthroughs by Huawei and its partners. It is possible that he is referring to the aforementioned domestic equipment transfer to SMIC’s facility. Ren further said that he is leading a network of more than 2,000 Chinese companies that are collectively working to ensure that China achieves self-sufficiency of more than 70 percent across the entire semiconductor value chain by 2028. These predictions should be taken seriously and have enormous strategic implications beyond just the AI sector. However, for AI, the key question remains the one that Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, has succinctly posed : “whether China will also be able to get millions of chips.” China’s success to date suggests that, at least for Huawei Ascend chips, the answer is that they will have millions of chips within the next year or two. Thankfully, these chips are, at present, dramatically lower performing than Nvidia ones for training advanced AI models; they are also supported by a much weaker software ecosystem with many complex issues that will likely take years to sort out. This is the time that the export controls have bought for the United States to win the race to AGI and then use that victory to try and build more durable strategic advantages. At this point, all the margin for sloppy implementation of export controls or tolerance of large-scale chip smuggling has already been consumed. There is no more time to waste. Gregory C.

Allen Published March 7 , 2025 Six months ago , few in the West aside from obsessive AI professionals had heard of DeepSeek , a Chinese AI research lab founded barely more than a year and a half ago . Today , DeepSeek is a global sensation attracting the attention of heads of state , global CEOs , top investors , and the general public . With the release of its R1 model on January 20 , 2025—the same day as President Trump ’ s second inauguration—DeepSeek has cemented its reputation as the top frontier AI research lab in China and caused a reassessment of assumptions about the landscape of global AI competition . By January 27 , DeepSeek ’ s iPhone app had overtaken OpenAI ’ s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app on Apple ’ s U.S. App Store . The stock prices of some U.S. tech companies briefly tumbled , including the AI chip designer Nvidia , which lost more than $ 600 billion off its valuation in a single day . ( AI chips are also known as graphics processing units , or GPUs , and the terms are used interchangeably in this report . ) ChatGPT has again overtaken DeepSeek in app store rankings , and Nvidia ’ s stock price has since mostly recovered . However , investor interest in Chinese tech companies has grown significantly and remains elevated . DeepSeek is now even reportedly seeking investment from venture capital firms . As a sector , AI is prone to overreactions and wild swings in perception . One might think that the story of DeepSeek is just another overblown AI hype cycle . However , the extraordinary attention focused on DeepSeek is justified , even if the conclusions some have drawn from its success are not . It would be a great mistake for U.S. policymakers to ignore DeepSeek or to suggest that its accomplishments are merely a combination of intellectual property theft and misleading Chinese propaganda . Policymakers need to understand that—even while DeepSeek has in some cases simply implemented innovations already known to U.S. AI companies—DeepSeek has also demonstrated genuine technological breakthroughs of its own . These facts deserve careful consideration as the second Trump administration sets its AI policy agenda . This paper provides an overview of DeepSeek ’ s origins and achievements , their geopolitical implications , and the key challenges facing U.S. and allied policymaking as a result . The paper pays particular attention to DeepSeek ’ s implications for the future of AI and semiconductor export control policy . It concludes that—while DeepSeek ’ s success does partly reflect failures of earlier implementations of U.S. export controls—these controls can continue to play a critical role in supporting the United States ’ strategy for winning the AI race against China . Success is not guaranteed and will require two things : ( 1 ) Preventing large-scale AI chip smuggling and ( 2 ) Preventing the team of Huawei and SMIC from providing a viable Chinese AI chip alternative to the leading incumbent international team of Nvidia and TSMC . Both will be exceedingly difficult , and in both cases export controls can at best slow and disrupt Chinese efforts , not stop them . Regarding the second point , Chinese sources and leaders are expressing renewed optimism . At a meeting on February 17 between Chinese Community Party ( CCP ) Chairman Xi Jinping and Chinese technology executives ( including DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng ) , Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei told Xi that his previous concerns about the lack of domestic advanced semiconductor production and the damaging impacts of U.S. export controls had eased because of recent breakthroughs by Huawei and its partners . Ren further said that he is leading a network of more than 2,000 Chinese companies who are collectively working to ensure that China achieves self-sufficiency of more than 70 percent across the entire semiconductor value chain by 2028 . These predictions should be taken seriously . While China ’ s economy faces many challenges , Gerard DiPippo of RAND is correct to argue , Even if overall economic growth remains comparatively weak and many Chinese firms continue to struggle , China ’ s central and local governments will keep supporting high-tech industries and emerging stars like DeepSeek . . . . Western policymakers shouldn ’ t make the mistake of believing China is down and out , and they shouldn ’ t be surprised when China continues to catch up or make breakthroughs in critical and emerging technologies . What follows are a series of 21 key judgments regarding DeepSeek , Huawei , export controls , and the future of U.S.-China AI competition . Readers are advised to pay special attention to the discussion of Huawei and SMIC , as this report contains a great deal of new and previously private information regarding Huawei ’ s progress toward indigenizing China ’ s AI and semiconductor technology stack . DeepSeek is a subsidiary of High-Flyer Capital Management , a Chinese quantitative hedge fund focused on algorithmic trading powered by deep learning . Deep learning is the core technology paradigm underlying the past two decades of rapid AI advancements . Cofounded in 2015 by Liang Wenfeng , who is also the founder and CEO of DeepSeek , High-Flyer was already ranked as the top Chinese hedge fund in 2019 . DeepSeek ’ s heritage via High-Flyer in the algorithmic trading world helps to explain its success in frontier AI research and especially its success with its most recent model releases . Algorithmic trading firms frequently own and operate their own data center infrastructure , which they use to develop proprietary investment strategies powered by machine learning artificial intelligence . High-Flyer has admitted that its activities include “ High-Frequency Trading , ” though High-Flyer de-emphasizes this work since it is politically controversial ( and was for a time banned ) in China . High-frequency trading firms race against each other to be the fastest asset traders reacting to new market developments and are obsessively focused on optimizing and accelerating their computing infrastructure . These efforts routinely include intense research on developing proprietary and unorthodox data center engineering methods for improved speed and efficiency . Firms can justify making these expensive investments in computing and network infrastructure optimization because the success or failure of trades collectively worth billions of dollars depends upon reducing the time between learning of a fact and making a stock trade based on that new fact by mere nanoseconds ( billionths of a second ) . High-Flyer is among the leaders of such firms in China and has long been among the most focused on both AI algorithms for trading and data center engineering . The Financial Times reported that , by mid-2022 , High-Flyer had already acquired more than 10,000 Nvidia A100 chips ( which at the time were the most advanced AI chips in the world ) and spent more than 1.2 billion RMB ( roughly $ 180 million at the time ) to build two data centers . These infrastructure investments distinguished High-Flyer from most other Chinese companies : Only four other companies in China possessed such a large quantity of chips at the time , and all were major tech companies , not finance companies . In a 2023 interview , Liang said : We always wanted to carry out larger-scale experiments , so we ’ ve always aimed to deploy as much computational power as possible . . . . We wanted to find a paradigm that can fully describe the entire financial market . In another 2023 interview with a Chinese media outlet , Liang provided a timeline for High-Flyer ’ s AI chip compute reserves as a gradual “ progression from one GPU in the beginning , to 100 GPUs in 2015 , 1,000 GPUs in 2019. ” He stated that , from the day of DeepSeek ’ s 2023 founding onward , High-Flyer had both the computational power and “ ample R & D budgets ” to support DeepSeek ’ s mission of “ research and exploration ” in pursuit of artificial general intelligence ( AGI ) . DeepSeek ’ s heritage from High-Flyer ’ s machine learning research and intensive computing optimization techniques are evident in some of the strategies that it has pursued to develop its AI models . More broadly , the synergy of technical skills between the world of algorithmic trading and AI research is well known . For example , industry sources at leading U.S. AI labs told CSIS that they have also focused on recruiting talent , especially compute infrastructure engineers , with experience in the high-frequency trading industry . Both sectors pay such talented individuals handsomely . DeepSeek ’ s recent technological achievements ( reflected in the DeepSeek-V2 , DeepSeek-V3 , DeepSeek-R1 , DeepSeek Math , and Native Sparse Attention technical papers ) can most easily be understood through two basic facts : First , DeepSeek has demonstrated a suite of algorithmic and architectural improvements that significantly reduce the amount of computing power ( and therefore financial investment ) required for any AI model to reach and operate at a given level of performance . This is true for both the training stage ( in which AI models are created ) and the inference stage ( in which their capabilities are used to serve internal or external customers ) . Second , DeepSeek has now developed AI models in China that are broadly comparable to the best U.S.-developed AI models introduced in mid-2024 ( e.g. , OpenAI ’ s o1 or Anthropic ’ s Claude 3.5 Sonnet ) . Of the two demonstrations , the fact that these advances came from China is more surprising than the fact that they happened at all . DeepSeek ’ s improvements in technical performance were consistent with preexisting trend lines of AI performance improvements . They represent expected performance breakthroughs , not shocking ones . To understand why , it is helpful to consider an analogy in the form of Moore ’ s Law . In economic terms , Moore ’ s Law essentially means that computer chips improve to be roughly twice as good in performance for the same amount of money roughly every two years . Though the nature of that performance improvement has changed , this trend has been consistently observed for almost six decades ( with some caveats ) . As Moore ’ s Law has been repeatedly validated since the 1960s , it has become steadily easier to confidently predict that computing performance per dollar will continue to double every two years . But , as the fortunes of Intel vividly demonstrate , that is not synonymous with being able to state with confidence which specific company or which specific technical innovations will deliver that improved performance . The same is true of AI today : It is easier to forecast the degree of AI performance growth than to forecast who will invent that performance growth or how . AI has its own versions of Moore ’ s Law that are driving exponential growth in both absolute performance and performance available at a given cost . At a high level , these sources of improvement can be grouped into three types : Epoch AI , an AI-focused nonprofit research institute , has estimated that , while the amount of human-generated training data will likely plateau in 2028 , algorithmic and architectural improvements and increased computing resources have been improving at 3x per year and 4.6x per year respectively—for a combined multiplier effect of 13.8x per year . In short , AI performance is increasing at a rate far faster than the familiar ( though still extraordinary ) pace of exponential progress described by Moore ’ s Law . Even ignoring the possible remaining improvements from harvesting additional training data , a ( highly oversimplified ) back-of-the-envelope estimate of future performance based on the compute trends and algorithmic architectural trends would suggest that AI performance at the end of 2028 will be more than 36,000 times better than at the beginning of 2025 , rather than just the four or eight times better that would be true if improvement were only occurring at the familiar pace of Moore ’ s Law . For those who only began paying attention to AI with the late 2022 launch of ChatGPT , this pace of progress can be both breathtaking and difficult to believe . However , for those familiar with the AI industry ’ s history over the past two decades , the fact that an AI model that requires a massive data center one year can run on a laptop or a single AI chip a few years later is well-known as a recurring , though still quite incredible , phenomenon . The dramatic reduction in cost-per-performance DeepSeek demonstrated is not a surprise to Western AI researchers . They have been leaders in driving—and benefitting from—the exact same trend for more than a decade . One might ask : “ If that is the case , why are U.S. AI labs still building ever larger and more powerful data centers ? ” Put simply , such companies are reinvesting all efficiency gains toward improved overall performance . Dario Amodei , CEO of the U.S. AI lab Anthropic , put it this way : Because the value of having a more intelligent system is so high , this [ reduced cost ] shifting of the curve typically causes companies to spend more , not less , on training models : the gains in cost efficiency end up entirely devoted to training smarter models , limited only by the company ’ s financial resources . Moreover , AI researchers are clearly nowhere near the absolute ceiling of computational performance and efficiency . The human brain is a real-world existence proof of human-level intelligence that requires only 20 watts of electricity , compared to the megawatts or gigawatts contemplated for future AI data centers . Despite the many differences between human brains and machine intelligence , the existence of the brain hints at future intelligence efficiency possibilities in much the same way that bird wings inspired the Wright brothers . Thus , it is not at all surprising that somewhere on earth , an AI research lab managed to deliver the improved AI performance-per-dollar that DeepSeek ’ s technical papers demonstrate . The only surprise is that the research lab that discovered some of the relevant technical innovations is a Chinese one , and notably one whose technical team appears to have been educated and trained almost entirely in China , rather than at Western universities or Western companies . While Chinese researchers have been at or close to world class in many domains of AI research for many years , DeepSeek represents the first time that a Chinese AI lab has demonstrated breakthroughs at or near the absolute frontier of foundational AI research . Many of the techniques that DeepSeek demonstrated are now the new state-of-the-art . Of note , this is exactly what the Chinese government set as a goal in China ’ s 2017 official AI strategy : By 2025 , China will achieve major breakthroughs in basic theories for AI , such that some technologies and applications achieve a world-leading level and AI becomes the main driving force for China ’ s industrial upgrading and economic transformation . In the first week after the publication of DeepSeek ’ s R1 paper , some commentators argued that DeepSeek ’ s results were fabricated as part of a Chinese propaganda effort or “ psyop. ” This is simply false . Researchers at U.S. universities have already reproduced some of the research results described in the DeepSeek V3 and R1 papers , and U.S. AI firms are already working on adapting DeepSeek ’ s novel techniques to utilize them in their own AI efforts . As will be discussed further in this paper , essentially all DeepSeek ’ s technical innovations relate to algorithmic and architectural improvements . DeepSeek did not have superior computing hardware , nor did they have access to uniquely important datasets ( excluding synthetic data ) that might have provided an advantage over Western researchers . The key technical innovations that DeepSeek demonstrated across the DeepSeek-V2 ( May 2024 ) , DeepSeek-V3 ( December 2024 ) , DeepSeek-R1 ( January 2025 ) , and other research papers are significant . Some of these innovations had already been independently discovered by U.S. firms ( and not disclosed publicly ) , but others were genuinely new . Many media and policy commentators in the United States and China have argued that DeepSeek ’ s efficiency gains are evidence that U.S. export controls have failed to restrain China ’ s AI sector and that DeepSeek proves that huge numbers of cutting-edge U.S. AI chips are not required for developing and serving high-performance AI capabilities . There is some merit to aspects of the first claim , but the second is wrong . To begin , DeepSeek ’ s V3 research paper states that their models were trained on 2,788,000 GPU-hours using Nvidia H800 chips , which , at an estimated cost of 2 dollars per GPU-hour , equates to $ 5.576 million . The H800 is a degraded version of the H100 chip that Nvidia specifically developed for the Chinese market to comply with the U.S. export controls imposed on October 7 , 2022 . In particular , those controls restricted the sale of chips that exceeded performance thresholds across two metrics : total processing power and interconnect speed . Government sources told CSIS that the U.S. government knew that these restrictions would prevent Nvidia from shipping its ( at the time ) market-leading A100 chip and upcoming H100 chips . They inferred that Chinese customers would be restricted to using the V100 , which was first introduced in 2017 and has significantly lower performance than its successors . Additionally , the U.S. government assumed that , if Nvidia were to develop a new chip specifically for the Chinese market that exceeded export control performance thresholds in one metric but not the other , this would require the typical multiyear AI chip development timeline . What the U.S. government architects of the October 2022 export control policy did not realize , however , was that Nvidia had a mechanism for post-manufacturing modification of its existing chip products . Specifically , each Nvidia chip is designed for redundancy , recoverability , and defect tolerance to minimize the impact of manufacturing defects . Such defects are a significant concern in the advanced node semiconductor industry , and designing chips to mitigate their potential impact is near universal . Nvidia can blow one or more strategically placed electrical fuses on the chip so that a manufacturing defect would usually only reduce the chip ’ s performance or deactivate a redundant component , rather than rendering the entire chip nonfunctional . Industry sources confirmed to CSIS that Nvidia blew fuses on A100 chips to reduce their interconnect speed ( but not their processing power ) below the export control performance thresholds , thus creating the A800 product lines . In essence , the A100 was born with the capability to become an A800 if needed , via fuse settings . The H800 , by contrast , did involve some minor Nvidia re-engineering and design optimization in the face of export controls . This allowed Nvidia to continue shipping large volumes of advanced AI chips ( with performance near the global state of the art ) to China without violating export controls and without taking multiple years to design new chips specifically for the Chinese market . According to reporting by The Information , the performance of the A800 and H800 chips was close enough to the performance of the originals that there was effectively no demand for large-scale AI chip smuggling to China during the period in which A800s and H800s were available . Why smuggle when the legally purchased chips are good enough ? The Biden administration ultimately realized that continued sales of the A800 and H800 meant that their policy would not have the intended impact on China ’ s AI ecosystem . Former government officials told CSIS that this was clear internally by December 2022 . However , it took the administration 12 months after their initial package of export controls to act . The U.S. government modified the export control performance thresholds in October 2023 to block exports of A800s , H800s , and any non-Nvidia chips with comparable performance to China . During the year-long period in which A800 and H800 chip exports to China were legal , an enormous number of them were sold to China . Precise sales figures are not available , but Nvidia ’ s disclosed sales to China between October 31 , 2022 , and October 31 , 2023 , exceeded 9 billion dollars . This does include revenue for chips that were not widely used in AI training or inference , however . See Table 1 for Nvidia ’ s quarterly revenue by billing locations . If DeepSeek were to admit that it used H100s in its data center to train its models , it would be confessing to activity illegal under U.S. law , since the H100 has never been legally available in China and can not even legally be purchased by Chinese-firm subsidiaries outside of China . Thus , if DeepSeek did engage in illegal activity , it would have an incentive to conceal this fact . This raises the question of whether DeepSeek lied in its publications when it claimed to have used H800 chips exclusively . Industry analyst Ben Thompson has pointed to strong evidence that DeepSeek did in fact use H800s as it claimed : Many of DeepSeek ’ s algorithmic and architectural improvements are ideal for maximizing the effective use of computing resources under conditions of limited interconnect bandwidth . At a minimum , this strongly suggests that DeepSeek uses many H800s in its computing infrastructure and that a model with the performance of V3 can indeed be trained exclusively on H800s . This does not prove , however , that DeepSeek exclusively uses H800s in its overall computing infrastructure . Indeed , some reporting in Chinese news media claims that DeepSeek did train its slightly more recent R1 model on Nvidia H100 chips that are banned from China under U.S. export controls . The semiconductor consulting firm SemiAnalysis , citing anonymous industry sources , recently wrote that DeepSeek has a total of 50,000 Hopper generation GPUs , a category that includes H100s , H800s , and H20s . SemiAnalysis specifically claimed that it has evidence that High-Flyer ’ s/DeepSeek ’ s computing infrastructure includes at least 10,000 H100s , 10,000 H800s , 30,000 H20s , and 10,000 A100s as part of its total computing stack . SemiAnalysis further estimated that High-Flyer/DeepSeek spent $ 1.63 billion in GPU server capital expenditures alone ( i.e. , excluding other data center construction and operating costs ) . Nathan Lambert , a machine learning researcher at the Allen Institute of Artificial Intelligence , has correctly pointed out that Tracking the compute used for a project just off the final pretraining run is a very unhelpful way to estimate actual cost . It ’ s a very useful measure for understanding the actual utilization of the compute and the efficiency of the underlying learning , but assigning a cost to the model based on the market price for the GPUs used for the final run is deceptive . In this case , it is not DeepSeek that is being deceptive , however , since their paper was extremely clear about what was and was not included in the $ 5.6 million figure . It was only the final , successful pretraining run . It did not include the compute cost of the hundreds of experiments that were run beforehand to generate the insights necessary for that final run , nor did it include the compute costs associated with post-training fine-tuning or inference compute workloads . While there is no public evidence that large-scale Nvidia chip smuggling occurred prior to October 2023 , industry sources told CSIS that , by early 2024 , large-scale H100 chip smuggling operations were underway . In mid-2024 , journalists at The Information interviewed participants in eight distinct H100 smuggling networks , each of which provided evidence that they had completed Chinese transactions worth more than $ 100 million . These networks continue to be active , with increasingly sophisticated techniques for evading detection . For example , a December 2024 investigation by The Information found that When notified of an upcoming inspection , smugglers have duplicated the serial numbers of the servers with Nvidia chips they ’ ve purchased from Supermicro [ and already smuggled to China ] and attached them to other servers they had access to . There is some evidence that governments are becoming more serious about cracking down on AI chip smuggling . Singapore was the billing location for 18 percent of Nvidia ’ s revenue in the most recently concluded fiscal year but the shipping location for only 2 percent of revenue . Officials in Singapore recently arrested three individuals accused of facilitating AI chip smuggling to China . The Singaporean government ’ s increased emphasis on cracking down on smuggling may reflect its concerns about being relegated to tier 2 status under the Biden administration ’ s AI Diffusion Framework . As with the introduction of Huawei ’ s Mate60 Pro 5G smartphone in August 2023 , many commentators were quick to highlight how DeepSeek reflected the failure of U.S. export controls . This included Chinese state-owned media , one outlet of which , GlobalVision , broadcast that “ DeepSeek and Huawei join forces ! . . . breaking through U.S. tech restrictions is not impossible ! ” Angela Zhang , a professor at the Gould School of Law , went further , arguing : China ’ s achievements in efficiency are no accident . They are a direct response to the escalating export restrictions imposed by the US and its allies . By limiting China ’ s access to advanced AI chips , the US has inadvertently spurred its innovation . This argument is in one sense true : Chinese firms like DeepSeek prioritized innovation in efficiency—and particularly efficiency innovations that are useful given the limitations of the H800—because that was the most attractive AI research path available to them . However , this argument is deeply flawed for three reasons . First , every leading AI firm , including both U.S. and Chinese ones , is pursuing enhanced efficiency . As mentioned above , DeepSeek ’ s efficiency improvements represented a continuation of preexisting industry trends in AI computation efficiency improvements , not a drastic acceleration of them . Even before DeepSeek was founded , and even before the U.S. imposed export controls , DeepSeek ’ s parent company was obsessively focused on improving computing efficiency ( though more focused on optimizing latency ) . It is strange to say that export controls caused AI firms to do something that they—both U.S. and Chinese—were already doing ( and already had a massive financial incentive to do ) before export controls were imposed . Second , the argument is flawed because it does not engage with the question of “ how much further along might China be in the absence of export controls ? ” The largest AI computing cluster currently operating on Earth is xAI ’ s Colossus supercomputer in Memphis , Tennessee , which was recently upgraded to use 200,000 H100 chips . Given that leading Chinese firms were already producing more AI-related patents , publishing nearly as many highly cited research papers , and spending nearly as much on data center capital expenditures before the export controls went into effect , it is entirely possible that China would already be ahead of the United States in AI in the absence of export controls . Jimmy Goodrich , a non-resident senior associate at the Wadhwani AI Center , put it well when he said , “ It ’ s been long known that DeepSeek has a really good team , and if they had access to even more compute , God knows how capable they would be. ” Goodrich ’ s statement on DeepSeek applies to China as a whole . Third , this argument does not take account of the benefits of reallocating the supply of high-performance chips that would otherwise have gone to China . Nvidia , which is estimated to have 90 percent global market share in AI chips , is supply constrained , not demand constrained . For every Nvidia chip that TSMC has been able to manufacture since 2022 , there are many customers willing to buy them . Larry Ellison , the cofounder of Oracle , colorfully described how Nvidia ’ s customers have to beg for greater chip allocation in September 2024 when he recounted a dinner between himself , xAI CEO Elon Musk , and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang : I would describe the dinner as Oracle—me and Elon begging Jensen for GPUs , [ saying ] “ Please take our money . Please take our money . By the way , I got dinner . No , no , take more of it . We need you to take more of our money please. ” What this means is that , since the AI chip shortage began in 2022 , all the chips that Nvidia would have sold to China in the absence of export controls would have come at the expense of customers elsewhere , which in this case is overwhelmingly the United States . In other words , eliminating the export controls would have not only helped China , it would have also hurt the United States , at least in terms of Nvidia chip allocation . For his part , DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng is under no illusions that the chip export controls have helped China or DeepSeek . In a July 2024 interview , he said , “ We do not have financing plans in the short term . Money has never been the problem for us ; bans on shipments of advanced chips are the problem. ” Liang has also said in an interview with a Chinese media outlet that U.S. restrictions on AI chips mean that Chinese companies must use two to four times the computing power to achieve the same results , referring to the penalty of using the H800 instead of the H100 for large model training . Further evidence of the impact of U.S. export controls comes from the fact that DeepSeek experienced widespread outages and had to halt new user sign-ups in the wake of its massive user adoption growth . While DeepSeek claimed that the outages were the result of cyberattacks , the far more likely explanation is that they simply lacked sufficient computing capacity to serve their growing user base . There is a big difference between the amount of computing power required to serve an AI large language model to a small number of users and doing what OpenAI does , which is serve its AI models to 400 million active users every week . More recently , DeepSeek has once again reopened new user sign-ups , which likely reflects the company successfully purchasing or renting additional computing capacity . Nevertheless , the point remains : Compute capacity matters . In describing its goals toward creating AGI , a recent DeepSeek job advertisement said that “ We believe AGI is the violent beauty of model x data x computing power. ” Though a bit oversimplified , that formula is still essentially correct and helps explain why having larger computing resources is a useful advantage at any level of computational efficiency . All of DeepSeek ’ s innovations were algorithmic and architectural . DeepSeek appears to have described all or nearly all of them in great detail in its research papers . That means that U.S. AI labs are free to apply these same innovations in training and deploying their own AI models . Indeed , U.S. firms are already doing so . But while DeepSeek ’ s algorithmic innovations are replicable by U.S. firms , DeepSeek will struggle to replicate U.S. AI chip and compute advantages . In the absence of extreme ultraviolet lithography ( EUV ) technology , China ’ s most advanced AI chip designer and logic chip manufacturer , Huawei and SMIC , respectively , will most likely remain stuck at 7 nanometers ( nm ) or perhaps a flawed 5 nm technology node for many years . The CEO of ASML , which is the sole firm in the world manufacturing EUV lithography machines , said “ By banning the export of EUV , China will lag 10 to 15 years behind the West . That really has an effect. ” By contrast , U.S. chip firms such as Nvidia will in coming years press forward past the 4 nm era into the 2 nm and beyond future , delivering chips that might be thousands or tens of thousands of times better performing integrated into data centers using tens or hundreds of times more chips . While there are still many ways in which the U.S. government could bungle export control implementation and enforcement—which will be discussed later in this paper—the greatest potential for impacts from the export controls are still well ahead in the future as the United States races forward and China ’ s progress continues to slow . Implemented properly , they offer the opportunity for a meaningful , though far from permanent , edge over China . Much of the initial commentary on DeepSeek suggested that demand for AI chips might plummet , as efficiency improvements meant that fewer chips were needed to achieve the same level of intelligence . While this is a generally accurate description of efficiency , it is a terrible description of how computing economics works . As mentioned above , Moore ’ s Law has driven a more than billionfold improvement in computing efficiency over the past seven decades . Does this mean that all of the world ’ s computing needs are handled by a single computer that costs only a fraction of a penny ? Of course not . Instead , the increased efficiency has made applying digital computation throughout the economy far more attractive , and so more governments , businesses , and consumers have invested in more computation across countless applications and use cases . This is the essence of Jevon ’ s Paradox , which describes how increasing efficiency can increase aggregate demand . The same is obviously going to be true of increased AI computational efficiency . Indeed , after the DeepSeek revelations , the largest data center buyers in the world—Microsoft , Google , Meta , and Amazon— announced that they were going to spend hundreds of billions of dollars in 2025 on AI chips and data centers , up by nearly 50 percent over the already record amount invested in 2024 . Chinese firms such as Alibaba have announced that they too will make massive chip purchases in the wake of DeepSeek . Nor is this merely a long-term phenomenon . Even in the short term , rental prices for H100 chips hosted by Amazon ’ s cloud computing spiked upward in the wake of DeepSeek ’ s publication as customers worked to incorporate DeepSeek models into their operations . More recently , OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that OpenAI would have to temporarily limit usage of its GPT 4.5 model because the company did not have sufficient GPUs to meet all of the demand . Moreover , there is almost certainly no “ ceiling ” for a desirable amount of intelligence and the computing required to power that intelligence . Miles Brundage , who previously led policy research at OpenAI , described it this way : To make a human-AI analogy , consider [ Albert ] Einstein or John von Neumann as the smartest possible person you could fit in a human brain . You would still want more of them . You ’ d want more copies . That ’ s basically what inference compute or test-time compute is—copying the smart thing . It ’ s better to have an hour of Einstein ’ s time than a minute , and I don ’ t see why that wouldn ’ t be true for AI . This again relates to how the most significant impacts of the export controls are likely in the future , as the evermore extremely scaled deployment of evermore powerful chips begins to bear fruit . It is the next few rounds of increasing AI computation—by tenfold , a hundredfold , a thousandfold—where China will be most severely blocked and the impact of the export controls will be most severely felt . Some Chinese AI researchers have made similar points . On February 13 , 2025 , Li Guojie , a scholar at the Chinese Academy of Engineering , told Chinese media outlet ChinaFund that DeepSeek ’ s success represents a step-change in Chinese AI capabilities but said that “ due to the blockade of the U.S. government , China is currently unable to obtain the most advanced chip process technology. ” Li went on to say [ machine translation ] : The success of DeepSeek does not deny the key role of computing power in the development of artificial intelligence . In fact , since there are much more equipment for reasoning than for training , the computing power required for reasoning [ aka inference ] will become the main requirement in the future . It is very important to improve the efficiency of the model through algorithm optimization . It is our basic choice to take the green development path of saving computing power , but computing power is definitely a necessary condition for solving artificial intelligence problems and can not be ignored . On January 29 , OpenAI told the New York Times that We know that groups in the P.R.C . are actively working to use methods , including what ’ s known as distillation , to replicate advanced U.S. A.I . models . . . . We are aware of and reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models . Distillation is a well-known technique that allows “ the transfer of knowledge from a larger , more complex language model ( the ‘ teacher ’ ) to a smaller , more efficient version ( the ‘ student ’ ) . ” In short , the inputs and outputs from the teacher model are used as very high-quality synthetic training data by the student model . Distillation is utilized by every major U.S. AI lab to offer smaller , more efficient versions of its models that are faster and cheaper to serve to customers . For example , GPT-4o-mini is the distilled version of GPT-4o , and both were made by OpenAI . There are multiple types of distillation , however , and the more advanced types , which AI labs use to distill their own models , require access to the internals of the models . While a firm distilling its own models is clearly harmless , there is a strategic consideration if one firm can distill another firm ’ s models , incurring most or all of the benefits of acquiring a highly capable AI model while incurring far fewer of the costs of creating such a model . In the case of OpenAI and DeepSeek , the distillation evidence appears quite strong : DeepSeek ’ s initially released models , when asked by users “ what model are you ? , ” will often respond , “ I ’ m ChatGPT. ” DeepSeek ’ s updated versions of the model , likely modified using fine-tuning techniques , no longer produce such responses , but this does not reduce the strength of the evidence that DeepSeek relied on distillation . Such unauthorized distillation would be a violation of OpenAI ’ s terms of service , but the law firm Fenwick has written that “ whether remedies against such [ a Terms of Service ] breach would sufficiently protect teacher-model owner ’ s IP remains to be determined. ” If OpenAI were to file a lawsuit against DeepSeek , for example , perhaps it would win in U.S. courts . But how would the size of judicial penalties compare to the strategic benefit for DeepSeek as a firm or for China as a country ? And the access to judicial remedies is almost certainly limited to the United States and other countries with strong intellectual property protections . Even if DeepSeek were hypothetically clearly guilty of not only distillation but an even more extreme case of outright corporate espionage , Chinese courts would likely find OpenAI guilty of stealing IP from DeepSeek rather than the reverse . This is what happened to U.S. chipmaker Micron when it accused China ’ s Fujian Jinhua of stealing memory chip trade secrets and when U.S. prosecutors charged Fujian Jinhua with economic espionage . In retaliation , Jinhua sued Micron in a Chinese court for patent infringement in early 2018 . The Fuzhou Intermediate People ’ s Court in Fujian province sided with the Chinese side and issued an injunction blocking Micron from selling 26 chip products in China . Similarly , when U.S. semiconductor equipment firm Veeco found that a Chinese competitor , Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment ( AMEC ) , was using Veeco ’ s proprietary designs , Veeco secured a preliminary injunction in a U.S. court to stop a supplier from providing parts to AMEC . However , in response , AMEC filed a patent suit in China , and the Fujian High Court ( the same province as above ) acted with remarkable speed . On December 7 , 2017—just weeks after AMEC ’ s filing—the court granted AMEC a preliminary injunction without even hearing Veeco ’ s defense . Thus , one should separate the questions of what is “ fair ” or “ true ” from what the strategic consequences are likely to be . Neither geopolitics nor business is a contest where first prize always goes to the most innovative . Many companies , including U.S. tech companies , have a perfectly viable business strategy of closely monitoring their innovative competitors and then either buying the competitor or replicating its innovation . Chinese firms can do the same , including in ways that both do and do not violate intellectual property . Thus , the meaningful strategic question for OpenAI and other U.S. AI firms is not whether DeepSeek is failing to play by the rules , it is whether U.S. firms have a mechanism for effectively preventing DeepSeek or any competitor from extracting the benefits of an AI lab ’ s investments without bearing the costs . What enduring sources of competitive advantages could the large U.S. AI labs secure if Chinese companies or other copycats ( potentially even U.S. ones ) can simply piggyback off their work to build cheaper and equivalently good models while incurring only a fraction of the costs ? One possible answer comes in the form of Meta ’ s strategy , which is to invest in developing open-source AI models justified not by the direct benefits of increasing monthly subscriptions , but by the indirect benefits of enhancing their existing social media and advertising business lines . Among the worst outcomes for U.S. AI companies would be if the fundamentals of AI research and development were structurally similar to those of the global pharmaceutical industry . In 2023 , the top 20 global pharmaceutical companies invested approximately $ 2.4 billion over 10 to 15 years into developing a typical new drug from start to finish . The costs of research and development dwarf those of drug manufacturing , marketing , and distribution , so the final price of the product must reflect the costs of research and development for pharmaceutical firms to have any hope of recovering their investments and earning a profit . To incentivize drug R & D , the U.S. government offers companies 20-year patents that allow them the exclusive right to sell their products in the United States at a monopoly premium to recover upfront R & D costs . However , once a patent expires , so-called generic manufacturers can reproduce and sell the same drug for a far lower price—avoiding the burden of R & D costs altogether . Generic manufacturers can thereafter compete by selling identical drugs while incurring only a tiny fraction of the costs faced by the original drug developer . In a world where there was no patent protection on new pharmaceuticals , investment in new drug discovery ( and thus the pace of innovative new drugs ) would be radically limited because governments and philanthropic actors might be the only ones willing to invest , and they would almost certainly do so at far lower levels than the current private sector does . Government and business-makers alike must now ask the question : What if frontier AI model research is structurally identical to that of the pharmaceutical industry , meaning extremely high upfront R & D costs and very low replication costs ? The implications for AI investment and for U.S.-China AI competition could be significant . The U.S.-China AI race is very likely not one in which gentlemanly concepts of “ fairness ” matter . Chinese companies have systematically stolen American IP for years and will almost certainly continue to do so . Beyond Chinese firms , the Chinese government has a very clear history of either not enforcing or outright supporting Chinese firms that illegally violate U.S. patents in cases where the Chinese government has identified the industry as strategically significant . AI certainly falls into that category . Kai-Fu Lee , arguably the top venture capitalist in China ’ s AI sector , wrote in his 2018 book AI Superpowers that imitation does not have the same stigma in China that it does in the United States . He went further to argue that China ’ s unabashed willingness to copy innovation and even ignore intellectual property makes its companies more competitive , not less . In describing the post-2010 rise of hypercompetitive and cutthroat Chinese tech firms as “ copycat gladiators , ” Lee ’ s writing on this topic is worth quoting at length : Silicon Valley may have found the copying undignified and the tactics unsavory . In many cases , it was . But it was precisely this widespread cloning—the onslaught of thousands of mimicking competitors—that forced companies to innovate . Survival in the internet coliseum required relentlessly iterating products , controlling costs , executing flawlessly , generating positive PR [ public relations ] , raising money at exaggerated valuations , and seeking ways to build a robust business ‘ moat ’ to keep the copycats out . Pure copycats never made for great companies , and they couldn ’ t survive inside this coliseum . But the trial-by-fire competitive landscape created when one is surrounded by ruthless copycats had the result of forging a generation of the most tenacious entrepreneurs on earth . As we enter the age of AI implementation , this cutthroat entrepreneurial environment will be one of China ’ s core assets in building a machine-learning-driven economy . Taking Lee ’ s argument one step further : If the future global competitive landscape for AI is one of ruthless copying in the absence of robust intellectual property protections , that is an environment where Chinese entrepreneurs ought to do extremely well , because it resembles the domestic Chinese tech ecosystem in which they grew up and thrived . Even over just the past three years , a diverse set of examples suggests that robustly protecting key knowledge in the AI field is likely to be extremely difficult : If you know which research dead ends to avoid ( e.g. , MCTS ) and roughly know what research direction to pursue , replication is much easier . These algorithmic insights likely slowly leaked through SF party conversations and other channels . It probably takes a few months once you have the idea for [ OpenAI ’ s reasoning AI model ] o1 to replicate it . That ’ s how DeepSeek did it without much compute . While there is ongoing research into techniques to prevent model distillation , and AI companies will no doubt increase these efforts in the wake of DeepSeek , this remains an open question with significant implications . In an interview published in ChinaTalk , Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said , Like all problems in cybersecurity . . . [ distillation is ] going to be an ongoing issue . That ’ s why some companies have chosen to kind of hide the chain of thought in their reasoning models , because it makes it much harder to distill . Those can be jailbroken . But folks are working on antidotes to jailbreaking . We just released something today that makes it much harder to jailbreak models . Even in a case where distillation and more explicit cases of technological espionage are difficult or impossible to prevent , however , there will remain the issue inference computation , which involves applying more computational resources so that the model can “ think ” harder about the answer to a question or so that the model can be used more times and serve more users . One way of thinking about this is that the nature of competitive advantage in AI could be shifting from a secret that one keeps ( i.e. , the model weights ) toward an asset that one controls ( i.e. , massive data center compute infrastructure ) . This means that export controls—if implemented and enforced effectively—still have an opportunity to have a strategic impact . Nevertheless , the U.S. government and U.S. AI firms need to take a tough look at whether and how they can remain competitive in a world where China does not respect intellectual property and is committed to devoting enormous state resources to technical espionage in the AI and semiconductor sectors . The Bureau of Industry and Security ( BIS ) at the U.S. Department of Commerce is the agency charged with adjudicating license applications and enforcing export controls , not just on semiconductors bound for China , but for all U.S. dual-use technology exports that might end up in Russia , Iran , North Korea , and many other restricted destinations . To implement its work overseeing trillions of dollars in economic activity and policing smuggling operations worldwide , BIS has fewer than 600 employees and a relatively paltry budget of just under $ 200 million . Semiconductors are just one technology category out of hundreds that this organization is responsible for enforcing . Reporting by The Information found at least eight Chinese AI chip–smuggling networks , with each engaging in transactions valued at more than $ 100 million . More recent reporting by the Wall Street Journal suggests that this smuggling now includes the latest generation of Nvidia Blackwell AI chips . China is betting that its network of smugglers and shell companies can find the leaks in the BIS export control enforcement barrier . As long as Congress continues to neglect BIS by providing grossly inadequate resources compared to the size and importance of its mission , China has a reasonable expectation of success . BIS needs not only more money , but also more skilled staff , more enforcement agents , and better enabling technology , especially in data analysis . Moreover , the Department of Commerce needs more help from the rest of the government , in particular the U.S. intelligence community . Declassified Central Intelligence Agency documents show that the intelligence community was deeply involved in assisting export control enforcement during the Cold War and delivered solid results by doing so . These are capabilities and priorities that have significantly atrophied in the post–Cold War era but urgently need to be restored . Recent efforts by the Trump administration to reduce government spending risk making a bad situation worse . On February 5 , 2025 , U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi signed a Department of Justice memorandum that , among many other actions , disbanded the National Security Division ’ s Corporate Enforcement Unit , which was “ created with the goal of investigating and prosecuting corporate actors involved in sanctions evasion , export control violations , and other national security-related economic crimes. ” The memo did not provide any explanation for how the duties of the unit would be performed elsewhere in the Department of Justice , which could mean that this will be implemented as a straightforward reduction in U.S. government capacity to enforce export controls . Of all the choices available , the worst policy choice that the U.S. government could make is to regulate aggressively but with large loopholes and weak enforcement . Such an approach—which fairly describes the approach taken in the first Trump administration and large chunks of the Biden administration—incurs nearly all the costs of an aggressive export control policy but does so without providing any of the possible strategic benefits in terms of slowing Chinese progress in semiconductors and AI . As described above , the nature of AI geopolitical advantage appears to be moving away from software secrets that are difficult to protect and toward hardware chip and data center assets that are ( hopefully ) easier to protect . In this sense , DeepSeek is not in and of itself the most significant threat to U.S. leadership in AI . Instead , the greater challenge arises from the possibility of China having a domestic ecosystem for producing its own AI chips at large scale and integrating them into Chinese data center training , as well as running inference for DeepSeek and other AI models . As U.S. technology firms are planning hundreds of billions of dollars in AI data center infrastructure investments , it is worth remembering that—for those investments to be possible—companies like TSMC must manufacture enough AI chips to fill those data centers . In the case of companies such as Nvidia , their revenue growth in recent years is less than it would have otherwise been due to shortages of TSMC production capacity . The Biden administration took many steps designed to definitively cut China ’ s AI chip designers off from TSMC production capacity . Most recently , on January 15 , the Commerce Department announced the final tranche of Biden administration export controls , often referred to as “ the Foundry Rule. ” The Foundry Rule moved advanced chip production to a white-list system that will likely make it impossible for Chinese AI firms to access TSMC capacity to produce chips above export control performance thresholds even when operating through complex shell company arrangements . However , as discussed below , TSMC manufactured a strategically significant quantity of chips on behalf of Huawei via shell companies prior to the rule going into effect . That effectively means that China ’ s long-term future in AI is closely tied to its ability to produce AI chips domestically . The Biden administration sought to hamstring China ’ s domestic production of advanced chips by restricting the sale of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment , including from other countries . Historically , one of the biggest sources of competitive advantage for Nvidia has been its CUDA ( Compute Unified Device Architecture ) software ecosystem . CUDA makes it much easier for programmers to write massively parallelized software ( as all modern AI software is ) and ensures backward and forward compatibility so that older chips can still run newer software and vice versa . Any customer who seeks to stop using Nvidia chips has to leave the CUDA ecosystem , which requires solving a lot of incredibly hard software problems for which CUDA already provides free answers . Those free answers reflect billions of dollars of investment in the CUDA platform by both Nvidia and its customers . DeepSeek stands out among AI model developers because it implemented software changes below the CUDA level . Most AI researchers rely on CUDA , a higher-level programming language for NVIDIA GPUs , because it simplifies the development process . However , CUDA does not allow fine-grained control over GPU operations at the level DeepSeek required . DeepSeek modified software instructions written in a language called PTX ( Parallel Thread Execution ) . By programming directly in PTX , DeepSeek engineers were able to optimize how the GPU handled specific workloads , particularly in managing expert specialization in the Mixture-of-Experts model and improving memory efficiency . This is an “ assembly-level ” approach to GPU programming—one that is both extremely difficult and ( at least historically ) rarely attempted . The trade-off , however , was a major increase in performance efficiency , particularly for large-scale AI training tasks . This suggests that DeepSeek may have both the technical knowledge and the open-source community enthusiasm to finally start generating momentum around Huawei ’ s competitor to CUDA , which Huawei refers to as its Compute Architecture for Neural Networks ( CANN ) . The greater maturity of the CUDA software ecosystem currently makes Nvidia chips more attractive , but this could change over the next few years . If it does , it would have major implications for Nvidia ’ s competitiveness both inside and outside of China . At present , the combination of Ascend chips ( discussed more below ) and CANN software appears far from being competitive to CUDA . A Financial Times report from September 2024 found that even Huawei employees found the product “ difficult and unstable to use ” and prone to crashing frequently . Industry sources told CSIS that DeepSeek ’ s more recent evaluation of CANN was very negative and that DeepSeek assessed that it would be years before the combination of Ascend chips and CANN-compatible software was a viable alternative . Still , this could change with time , effort , and investment . Huawei recently joined the open-source PyTorch foundation in an effort to increase Ascend and CANN compatibility of the PyTorch AI development framework . There is at least one meaningful precedent regarding the difficulty of leaving the Nvidia CUDA ecosystem , which is Google ’ s shift from TensorFlow on Nvidia GPUs to JAX on their proprietary chips , called TPUs . In this case , it took several years for JAX to mature and for a critical mass of software libraries to appear—even with heavy Google investment and the payoff opportunity in terms of both efficiency and competitive differentiation . Even by 2023 , Google was still heavily investing to improve JAX ( for example , addressing pain points like multi-host setup and memory efficiency ) and encouraging its use through education ( tutorials , conference workshops ) . For a company like DeepSeek , migrating all AI workloads from CUDA to CANN would likely be a multiyear project . Google ’ s internal shift took 2–3 years to bear significant fruit , and even then Google maintained support for both for a long while . Domestically producing large quantities of AI chips will require China to domestically replicate multiple segments of the AI chip value chain . The most important links are AI chip design , advanced node logic chip manufacturing , and advanced node high-bandwidth memory ( HBM ) manufacturing . Each of these will be addressed in turn . Like the United States , China has many different companies working on AI chip design , including Huawei , Cambricon , Biren , and more . However , Huawei is unambiguously in the strongest position with its Ascend AI chip product line . Industry sources also told CSIS that Huawei—due to its highly influential position with the Chinese government and its size as a customer—has the greatest leverage over SMIC . In other words , even if Huawei were not the best AI chip designer in China , it would still be the most important since it is in a position to restrict the share of SMIC manufacturing capacity that goes toward its domestic competitors . Huawei has been a player in the AI chip market for longer than is generally realized . Huawei had a 7 nm AI Accelerator chip planned for production at TSMC in 2020 . At the time , Huawei was preparing to capitalize the so-called 3-5-2 policy , in which the CCP ’ s Central Office ordered all government agencies and many state-owned enterprises to eliminate the use of all non-Chinese technology within three years . However , Huawei was unable to fulfill demand because of the first Trump administration ’ s updated 2020 entity listing , which temporarily cut Huawei ’ s Ascend and Kirin lines off from TSMC . In this instance , Nvidia was the beneficiary of these early U.S. export controls , which delivered a setback to Chinese efforts to eliminate dependence on U.S. AI chip technology . Today , Huawei ’ s Ascend product line is focused on the Ascend 910B and the Ascend 910C , the latter of which includes two Ascend 910B logic dies per integrated unit ( meaning more real estate on each silicon wafer is required for manufacturing an Ascend 910C than a 910B ) . DeepSeek has reportedly evaluated the Ascend chips and found that they are unattractive for training AI models but that each Ascend 910C delivers roughly 60 percent of the performance of an Nvidia H100 for inferencing AI models . This matters greatly since more and more of the computing requirements for advanced AI models are expected to be devoted to inference in the coming years . Barclays , an investment bank , estimates that by 2026 , 70 percent of AI compute demand will come from inference . In February 2024 , Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that utilization of its chips was “ 40 percent inference , 60 percent training , ” compared to 90 percent training-focused in the 2016 timeframe . Chinese firms like Huawei have historically had two major options for manufacturing their AI chip designs : outsource production abroad to TSMC of Taiwan or produce chips domestically in partnership with SMIC . For a time , it seemed as though the 2020 entity listing of Huawei definitively cut the company off from accessing TSMC advanced node manufacturing capacity . The October 2022 and October 2023 export controls were supposed to have done the same for all advanced node AI chip designers in China . However , TSMC manufactured large quantities of Huawei Ascend 910B chips on behalf of Huawei shell companies and shipped the chips to China in violation of U.S. export controls . In an interview with the New York Times , an unnamed Taiwanese official acknowledged that these chips “ ended up in the hands of Huawei. ” Government officials told CSIS that TSMC manufactured more than 2 million Ascend 910B logic dies and that all of these are now with Huawei . If true , this is enough dies to make 1 million Ascend 910C units . However , the advanced packaging process by which two Ascend 910B dies and HBM are combined into a unified Ascend 910C chip also introduces defects that can compromise the functionality of the chip . Industry sources told CSIS that roughly 75 percent of the Ascend 910Cs currently survive the advanced packaging process . This is a strategically significant stockpile of AI chips . For comparison , Nvidia reportedly shipped 1 million H20 chips ( which are inference specialized and targeted at the Chinese market ) to China in 2024 . Nvidia ’ s January 26 SEC filing states that it generated $ 17 billion in revenues from Chinese customers in the most recently ended fiscal year ( which would obviously exclude revenues from chips later smuggled to China ) . Presumably , the vast majority of these revenues are from H20 sales . Even though Huawei likely has the more than 2 million Ascend 910B logic dies made by TSMC , there is a question as to whether it has enough HBM to integrate with those dies in manufacturing 1 million Ascend 910Cs . It seems likely that Huawei does , however , since the U.S. plan to restrict all advanced HBM sales to China on a country-wide basis was leaked to Bloomberg in August 2024 and did not go into effect until December of that year , giving Huawei ample time to legally acquire HBM chips as part of a stockpiling strategy . Industry sources told CSIS that Huawei has stockpiled enough HBM to meet their internal expectations for at least a full year ’ s worth of production , mostly in the form of purchases from Samsung of South Korea , potentially via shell companies , that occurred before the December controls went into effect . It is as though the U.S. government was having an internal debate about whether or not to have a surprise attack , and in the spirit of compromise , the slow interagency process settled on attacking without the surprise . This was an egregious failure with strategic consequences . With the adoption of the Foundry Rule , it will hopefully be impossible for Huawei or other Chinese AI chip designers to ever again access TSMC manufacturing capacity , even when using sophisticated shell company tactics . Huawei will instead be restricted to what Chinese domestic logic chip manufacturers can produce . However , there is also the potential risk that an existing chip design company on the Foundry Rule white list could be tempted by massive revenue opportunities to act as a pass-through to give Huawei access to TSMC . Guarding against this risk will require making clear to TSMC that the negative consequences of continuing to supply Huawei with advanced AI chips would be colossal compared to the revenue and profit opportunity . Similarly , Huawei may attempt similar tactics with other chip foundries such as Samsung or even Intel . The most advanced logic chip manufacturer in China is SMIC . SMIC ’ s SN2 facility in Shanghai is the sole facility in China with an active 7 nm logic chip production line and has been producing 7 nm chips since July 2021 , more than a year before the first tranche of the Biden administration ’ s semiconductor equipment export controls went into effect . SMIC and Huawei are now working to bring a 5 nm node into scaled production but must do so without access to EUV lithography equipment , since China has no local producer of EUV lithography machines and since export controls have prevented such machines from ever being exported to China . Industry sources told CSIS that , in early 2020 , ASML was poised to ship EUV tools to China and that SMIC was planning to work with key research labs in Europe , such as the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre ( IMEC ) , to help develop their EUV-based manufacturing process . In December 2024 , industry sources told CSIS that SMIC currently has enough immersion deep ultraviolet ( DUV ) lithography equipment supplied by the Dutch company ASML to produce 85,000 FinFET wafers per month ( WPM ) across both SN1 ( which focuses on 14 nm node production ) and SN2 ( which focuses on 7 nm and 5 nm production ) . This acquisition of lithography tools reportedly took effect before Dutch DUV lithography export controls went into effect in mid-2023 . However , the bottleneck in expanding 7 nm ( which in SMIC ’ s node naming system is called “ N+2 ” ) production capacity has not been lithography but rather U.S. tools for etching , deposition , inspection , and metrology . The shortage of inspection and metrology tools has also been an important factor preventing SMIC from improving its yield . SMIC acquired lithography equipment as a stockpiling measure in anticipation of future export controls by the Dutch government . Low production rate also has an impact on yield , since manufacturing technicians and engineers tend to improve their techniques based on experimentation and observed results from production . Thus , more production is helpful in accelerating the pace of learning and thus improving the yield . Based on the Ascend 910B die size of 665.61 mm² , CSIS estimates that each 300-millimeter diameter silicon wafer produces roughly 80 chip dies . This is simply counting the number of small rectangles ( chip dies ) that can fit inside the large circle ( the wafer ) . A source told CSIS that of these 80 chip dies : SMIC ’ s 20 percent yield when producing Ascend 910Bs is quite low , but it is not as low as it might seem . In 2020 , when Nvidia moved its GPU production to TSMC ’ s 7 nm process , the defect-free yield rate was roughly 41.5 percent . Since manufacturing defects occur randomly on a defects per square centimeter of chip area basis , larger chips ( such as AI chips ) are more susceptible than smaller chips ( such as smartphone application processors ) to a high defect rate . Using TSMC during roughly the same time period and with roughly the same defect rate , Apple ’ s A12 processor enjoyed 90 percent+ yield . SMIC also makes the application processor for Huawei ’ s Mate smartphone line , and its yield when making these smaller chips is somewhere in the 50–70 percent range . However , a February 24 , 2025 report by the Financial Times , citing two anonymous individuals , claims that SMIC ’ s AI chip yield has increased to roughly 40 percent . Industry sources told CSIS that the Financial Times report is not correct and that Huawei/SMIC ’ s true yield remains at 20 percent . One explanation for the discrepancy would be if the Financial Times ’ sources were mistakenly including both the fully functional chips and the chips that are functional but with degraded performance when estimating yield . As mentioned above , SMIC ’ s shortage of deposition , etching , inspection , and metrology semiconductor manufacturing equipment also been an important factor preventing expanded production capacity of its SN2 facility . Some of this equipment is restricted on a country-wide basis , meaning that it can not be legally sold anywhere in China . However , other types of this equipment were restricted only on an end-use and end-user basis . This means that the equipment can be sold to some customers in China but not others . In some cases , this even means that it can be sold to some facilities of a particular customer , but not others . In such cases , relocating the equipment from one facility to another would require a new export license in order to be legal . But SMIC ’ s production of 7 nm chips using U.S. equipment is already illegal , and both SMIC and other Chinese firms always have the option to choose illegal activity , particularly since such activity frequently enjoys the active support of the Chinese government . Industry sources told CSIS that SiEn , Pensun , and Huawei ’ s fab in Dongguan all were able to legally acquire the needed etching , deposition , and inspection/metrology equipment that SMIC needs for two reasons : ( 1 ) the equipment was not restricted on a country-wide basis to all of China and ( 2 ) the equipment was restricted on an end-use and end-user basis , but SiEn and Pensun told U.S. firms that it would exclusively be used for producing chips less advanced than 14 nm . These firms also denied any affiliation with Huawei . Government officials told CSIS that in such circumstances , the equipment can often be sold under a no-license required status . According to the sources , SiEn and Pensun , however , did not have sufficient customers providing demand for using all of the equipment they had purchased , and so some of it was never used operationally in their fabs . They purchased the equipment as a stockpiling move in anticipation of future export controls . The source described this as a “ buy everything you can , while you can ” strategy . The SMIC SN2 facility needed the equipment . Since SiEn and Pensun were not making economically productive use of the equipment , they were amenable to a sale . This sale was negotiated in Q4 of 2024 and completed in Q1 of 2025 . The sources are under the impression that all of the desired equipment is currently either installed at SMIC SN2 or on-site awaiting installation . This equipment will eliminate the near-term U.S. equipment bottleneck facing SMIC for SN2 7 nm production . SMIC ’ s new 7 nm production bottleneck is the overall size of the facility . Prior public statements from SMIC indicated that the SN1 and SN2 facilities combined have a maximum capacity of 85,000 WPM and that SMIC intended to split production evenly between the two facilities , implying SMIC was targeting ~42,500 WPM of lithography capacity at SN2 . Sources told CSIS that SMIC was targeting 50,000 WPM of 7 nm specifically by the end of 2025 . It is unclear whether this means that 7 nm production will now also take place at SN1 or whether SMIC has figured out a production process and equipment configuration that allows them to squeeze more production capacity than expected into SN2 . If , hypothetically , SMIC were to devote all 50,000 WPM to Ascend 910C manufacturing , this would imply producing 4 million Ascend 910B dies per month , of which 800,000 would be fully functional . 800,000 910B Ascend dies is enough to manufacture 400,000 910C chips , though the advanced packaging process would reduce yield further , and it is unclear how much HBM Huawei has on hand . SMIC is unlikely to devote all of its 7 nm capacity to Ascend chips . Huawei needs that 7 nm capacity for its chips for smartphones , laptops , data centers , and telecommunications equipment . Moreover , SMIC has other customers besides Huawei . Still , the point remains that Huawei is likely poised to dramatically expand Ascend production in the near future . Over time , SMIC ’ s 7 nm yield will likely improve significantly above 20 percent due to the additional equipment and the increased production rate . It will likely not match the best TSMC 7 nm yields for AI chips , however , since TSMC ’ s best 7 nm yields used EUV , and China has no credible near-term path for acquiring EUV technology . Over the mid and long term , however , Huawei is working aggressively to produce a domestic alternative to ASML EUV technology . Huawei currently has two semiconductor manufacturing equipment tool research facilities , one in Shanghai and one in Shenzhen . According to a report by Nikkei Asia , Huawei is investing $ 1.66 billion in the Shanghai facility alone and has hired a large number of chip industry veterans with experience working at companies like Applied Materials , Lam Research , KLA , ASML , TSMC , Intel , and Micron . Taylor Ogan , a venture capitalist based in Shenzhen , China , focused on investing in Chinese technology companies , described Huawei ’ s EUV efforts as follows : There are teams at Huawei in two different parts of China that are working around the clock . . . . They are literally cut off from their friends and family just because the work they are doing is so sensitive , and imagine how quickly they ’ re going to accelerate Chinese complete domestic chip development . . . . One of them is in Shenzhen . That ’ s the bigger [ EUV lithography ] breakthrough lab , and you can look on Google Earth . There was nothing there and now there is something there , and there are thousands of people working there . The other one is around Shanghai and that is more for the next chips in the next phones . So , yeah , the bigger lithography breakthroughs are [ being worked on ] in Shenzhen . . . . They ’ re working their asses off . . . . This is like some of the smartest people in the space , and they ’ re all Chinese . As mentioned above , these secretive efforts underway at Huawei are extremely likely to be benefitting from state-backed industrial espionage , including the cyberattacks on ASML and its partners . A high-quality recent analysis by Nicholas Welch , Lily Ottinger , and Jordan Schneider of ChinaTalk concludes that China ’ s current compute shortage has more to do with practical challenges and suboptimal deployment—many idle small and medium data centers rather than fewer fully-utilized superclusters—than it does with an absolute shortage of chips . A combination of recent Chinese government policy changes , such as “ hand [ ing ] over their idle computing resources to cloud providers ” and strategic moves by China ’ s largest tech companies to favor DeepSeek models even over their in-house ones , suggests that this could change in the near future . According to reporting by Caijing Magazine , the chips in China most likely to be underutilized are Huawei ’ s Ascends , which have benefitted in terms of government pressure to buy domestic but remain underutilized because of a lack of useful AI models that are Ascend-compatible . This could change if DeepSeek adapts its models to run on Ascends , which it is reportedly working toward for model inference , though not model training . As mentioned above , sources told CSIS that TSMC has supplied Huawei with enough chip dies to manufacture a million Ascend 910C chips , each of which has roughly 60 percent the performance of an Nvidia H100 when used for inference . With the help of Huawei and the Chinese government , DeepSeek could plausibly succeed in driving a reallocation of the Nvidia H800s and H100s already in China toward itself for construction of a new AI model training data center . This could then be augmented by an additional , much larger cluster of Huawei Ascend 910Cs ( or Nvidia H20s ) to be used for AI model inference . Such a combination is a plausible , perhaps even likely , path for China to continue making significant progress in its AI development . As discussed above , a million-chip cluster of Huawei Ascends would face the challenge of a shortage of AI models , software , and developer tools that are compatible with Huawei ’ s CANN software ecosystem . A second challenge is in integrating all of the chips as part of a single cluster where the whole is more than the sum of the parts . Financial Times reporter Eleanor Olcott interviewed one Beijing-based chip investor who said “ The bottleneck at the moment isn ’ t getting the chips but figuring out how to make them work in a cluster . This is really complicated work. ” Evidently the true attractiveness of the Huawei Ascend 910C chips is worse than the “ 60 percent of H100 ” figure might suggest . As discussed above , in the absence of export controls , it is plausible that Chinese firms would have already surpassed their U.S. competitors in developing and deploying frontier AI models . It is likewise plausible that China might have already succeeded in driving widespread adoption of the Huawei Ascend chips , just as Huawei ’ s smartphone division , bolstered by internal chip designs , was looking poised to overtake Apple ’ s iPhone in China prior to the introduction of effective export controls in 2020 . The export controls have done much to slow and complicate China ’ s technological rise and march toward their longstanding objective of technological self-sufficiency . They are still having a significant effect even now and are poised to have even greater impact in the future as U.S. firms benefit from Nvidia ’ s next-generation Blackwell chips and as China likely remains stuck at the 7 nm technology node until and unless they develop a domestic EUV lithography capability . However , China ’ s successes in substantial government investment , chip smuggling , exploiting gaps in U.S. export control coverage , completing in-country transfers of equipment , hiring talent with experience from leading international firms , reverse-engineering foreign technology , harnessing state-backed economic espionage , and producing genuine domestic innovation are a formidable combination . U.S. firms , working at maximum effort and with the benefit of all their own advantages , will still likely be the first to develop artificial general intelligence or artificial superintelligence . This should not , however , be taken for granted . At a meeting on February 17 between CCP Chairman Xi Jinping and Chinese technology executives , including DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng , Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei told Xi that his previous concerns about the lack of domestic advanced semiconductor production and the damaging impacts of U.S. export controls had eased because of recent breakthroughs by Huawei and its partners . It is possible that he is referring to the aforementioned domestic equipment transfer to SMIC ’ s facility . Ren further said that he is leading a network of more than 2,000 Chinese companies that are collectively working to ensure that China achieves self-sufficiency of more than 70 percent across the entire semiconductor value chain by 2028 . These predictions should be taken seriously and have enormous strategic implications beyond just the AI sector . However , for AI , the key question remains the one that Dario Amodei , CEO of Anthropic , has succinctly posed : “ whether China will also be able to get millions of chips. ” China ’ s success to date suggests that , at least for Huawei Ascend chips , the answer is that they will have millions of chips within the next year or two . Thankfully , these chips are , at present , dramatically lower performing than Nvidia ones for training advanced AI models ; they are also supported by a much weaker software ecosystem with many complex issues that will likely take years to sort out . This is the time that the export controls have bought for the United States to win the race to AGI and then use that victory to try and build more durable strategic advantages . At this point , all the margin for sloppy implementation of export controls or tolerance of large-scale chip smuggling has already been consumed . There is no more time to waste . Gregory C.

US,www.csis.org,news,"November 24, 2025",Did U.S. Semiconductor Export Controls Harm Innovation?,"Photo: I-Hwa Cheng/Bloomberg via Getty Images Commentary by Andreas Schumacher Published November 5, 2024 In recent years, the United States has enacted a series of targeted sanctions and export controls aimed at curtailing China’s progress in advanced semiconductor technologies. These measures, implemented over the course of the last two administrations, have sparked a debate regarding their effectiveness and potential impact on innovation. Critics argue that such controls could stifle technological progress . This report analyzes research and development (R&D) expenditure, patent filings, and earnings call transcripts from 30 leading semiconductor companies based in the United States and allied nations since 2017. The findings indicate that there is no substantial evidence to date to support the notion that recent U.S. semiconductor controls have hindered these companies’ innovative capabilities. Moreover, the data suggests that by some metrics, companies impacted by the October 2022 controls, on average, even outperformed a comparable group not affected by these controls: the impacted companies exhibited a higher increase in R&D spending and patent filings. This seemingly counterintuitive outcome might be attributable to the companies’ advantageous exposure to the rapidly growing market for artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductors, which has fueled their growth and innovation efforts. These findings offer three recommendations to policymakers: The Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls established export controls for semiconductor transistors as early as the mid-1950s . During this period, early integrated circuits were primarily manufactured for the U.S. military and NASA, thus placing the early semiconductor industry under stringent export controls. The perception of semiconductors as dual-use goods evolved with the advent of the consumer electronics industry and the development of a global industry. Semiconductors began to be increasingly regarded as commercial goods. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, export controls on telecom items and computers were maintained, yet a priority was blocking the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. While some semiconductor export controls were maintained on a narrow band of military-spec semiconductors, the prevailing industry sentiment was driven by the exponential growth of consumer microelectronics. In September 2022, U.S. national security advisor Jake Sullivan reaffirmed the national security imperative of maintaining technological superiority for advanced logic and memory chips. His speech, however, marked one significant policy shift by declaring the need to maintain “as large of a lead as possible” in these critical technologies, rather than a sliding-scale approach. In line with previous policy , those controls were to protect only a “ small yard with a high fence .” As a result, in October 2022, and with further refinements in October 2023, the United States implemented new export controls aimed at restricting China’s access to advanced semiconductor technology. These controls included limitations on the most advanced AI chip sales and the export of some chip-making equipment. For industry observers in the United States, allied nations, and China, the onset of this new period had arguably begun three years earlier, in May 2019, when, under President Trump’s administration, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) placed severe restrictions on technology exports to Huawei and its affiliates. These moves signaled a more aggressive stance on limiting technological transfers to potential adversaries, setting the stage for the subsequent policies implemented under the Biden administration. The debate over just how large a yard and high a fence national security requires, and whether controls risk harming the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem without advancing national security remains active and largely anecdotal. Study Found No Impact of Recent U.S. Semiconductor Export Controls on Innovation Evaluating a company’s capacity for innovation from the outside is more difficult than assessing its revenues or market capitalization[1]. Nonetheless, both quantitative and qualitative indicators are available: R&D spending lays the groundwork for innovation, while patent filings correlate with the development of innovative products. Moreover, significant changes in a company’s innovative capacity would also need to be communicated to investors. This study focused on the 30 semiconductor companies that, as of September 30, 2024, constituted the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. The analysis relied on public financial data and a detailed, manual review of the company’s earnings call transcripts. Based on statements by the company in earnings calls, either proactively or in response to analysts’ questions, companies were classified into one of three groups: Two companies were affected by both the 2019 Listing and the 2022 Controls and were included in both groups. Figure 1 provides an overview of the population. The study then compared cumulative absolute R&D spending (in reporting currency) and the number of patent filings in the two years before and after the implementation of the respective controls. A normalized, non-weighted average was calculated for each group to mitigate quarterly fluctuations and prevent the largest companies from skewing results. The outcome is summarized in Figure 2: In the two years following the 2019 Listing, both impacted and non-impacted companies increased their R&D spending by approximately 30 percent compared to the two years prior to the controls. Similarly, patent filings rose by 21 percent and 12 percent, respectively. Accepting R&D spending and patent filings as proxies for a company’s innovative capacity, the data for the 2019 Listing therefore does not indicate a decline in the impacted companies’ innovativeness—either in absolute terms or relative to non-impacted peers. This qualitative finding is further supported by a manual analysis of the impacted companies’ quarterly earnings call transcripts over the post–2019 Listing period: the vast majority of company management remained optimistic about innovation, frequently announcing expanded R&D spending. Not a single instance was found when company management reported declining innovation as a result of the controls. The 2022 Controls present an even more pronounced and surprising picture. Impacted companies increased their R&D spending by 68 percent compared to a 27 percent increase among non-impacted peers. A patent analysis for this period is not yet possible due to an 18-month lag between patent filing and publication. As with the 2019 Listing, the quantitative findings for the 2022 Controls are corroborated by earnings call statements: company management consistently conveyed a positive and confident outlook on their R&D efforts to the capital markets. Finally, while the companies’ revenue development in reaction to the two specific events was not a focus of this study – corporate revenues and profits, while a precondition, do not necessarily have to be invested in innovation – the qualitative results are the same. A financial analyst with a narrow focus on companies’ financial performance and earnings calls may not find the results of this analysis surprising. However, it might be unexpected for policymakers and offer new aspects for academic research on export controls. For instance, a comprehensive analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York of U.S. export controls since 1997 across all industries identified negative abnormal stock returns, a reduction in bank lending, and declines in profitability and employment as consequences. To make sense of this more focused study’s findings, a closer look at the semiconductor industry’s situation during the relevant time period and the specific nature of the most recent export controls might help. Four explanations are possible: These factors—and how they will develop over time—provide important hints as to whether future export control restrictions will have material collateral effects or not. Innovation is the lifeblood of the semiconductor industry. The industry, and by extension national security as well as commercial applications, have benefited like few others from international cooperation and access to global markets. Semiconductor innovation is key to a digitalized and decarbonized future. The full, long-term impact of limiting market access and diverging technological spheres on semiconductor companies remains to be fully understood. A comprehensive net assessment of technology ecosystems must not only be analytically rigorous but also consider respective government actions to promote domestic industries. Part of this comprehensive assessment should explore secondary effects, such as whether a market share loss (“design-out”) of U.S. and allied semiconductor companies is indirectly caused by export controls or simply a result of China’s concurrent efforts to establish domestic supply chains for critical technologies. The findings of this study should not be interpreted as an endorsement for policymakers to indiscriminately expand export controls. The implications of such measures necessitate careful consideration and strategic implementation to avoid unintended consequences. In invoking export controls, the government should continue to focus on clear, narrowly defined national security rationales and transparently communicate those to market participants. This is especially important since barriers that would affect commercial success and innovation in the semiconductor industry also impact progress towards shared global responsibilities such as electrification and decarbonization: the national security prerogative should be made clear, and the trade-offs need to be at least understood if not accepted. Understanding the market dynamics and competitive situation of affected industries is paramount to target controls, and also to conceive, if needed, supportive industrial policy. Given the breadth of responsibilities of export control agencies in the U.S. and allied countries, governments need to staff them sufficiently , and ensure direct, regular information exchange with industry participants. For these exchanges to be impactful and fact-based, the governments should conduct regular economic impact analyses of their export controls and build an independent knowledge base of market and competitive dynamics. Multilateral export controls are more effective than unilateral controls, and the United States should continue to work with allies on an aligned approach, preferably in a suitable overall framework. In addition to being more effective, a multilateral approach also ensures a level playing field among U.S. and allied companies.

This seemingly counterintuitive outcome might be attributable to the companies ’ advantageous exposure to the rapidly growing market for artificial intelligence ( AI ) semiconductors , which has fueled their growth and innovation efforts . These findings offer three recommendations to policymakers : The Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls established export controls for semiconductor transistors as early as the mid-1950s . During this period , early integrated circuits were primarily manufactured for the U.S. military and NASA , thus placing the early semiconductor industry under stringent export controls . The perception of semiconductors as dual-use goods evolved with the advent of the consumer electronics industry and the development of a global industry . Semiconductors began to be increasingly regarded as commercial goods . Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union , export controls on telecom items and computers were maintained , yet a priority was blocking the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . While some semiconductor export controls were maintained on a narrow band of military-spec semiconductors , the prevailing industry sentiment was driven by the exponential growth of consumer microelectronics . In September 2022 , U.S. national security advisor Jake Sullivan reaffirmed the national security imperative of maintaining technological superiority for advanced logic and memory chips . His speech , however , marked one significant policy shift by declaring the need to maintain “ as large of a lead as possible ” in these critical technologies , rather than a sliding-scale approach . In line with previous policy , those controls were to protect only a “ small yard with a high fence . ” As a result , in October 2022 , and with further refinements in October 2023 , the United States implemented new export controls aimed at restricting China ’ s access to advanced semiconductor technology . These controls included limitations on the most advanced AI chip sales and the export of some chip-making equipment . For industry observers in the United States , allied nations , and China , the onset of this new period had arguably begun three years earlier , in May 2019 , when , under President Trump ’ s administration , the U.S. Department of Commerce ’ s Bureau of Industry and Security ( BIS ) placed severe restrictions on technology exports to Huawei and its affiliates . These moves signaled a more aggressive stance on limiting technological transfers to potential adversaries , setting the stage for the subsequent policies implemented under the Biden administration . The debate over just how large a yard and high a fence national security requires , and whether controls risk harming the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem without advancing national security remains active and largely anecdotal . Study Found No Impact of Recent U.S. Semiconductor Export Controls on Innovation Evaluating a company ’ s capacity for innovation from the outside is more difficult than assessing its revenues or market capitalization [ 1 ] . Nonetheless , both quantitative and qualitative indicators are available : R & D spending lays the groundwork for innovation , while patent filings correlate with the development of innovative products . Moreover , significant changes in a company ’ s innovative capacity would also need to be communicated to investors . This study focused on the 30 semiconductor companies that , as of September 30 , 2024 , constituted the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index . The analysis relied on public financial data and a detailed , manual review of the company ’ s earnings call transcripts . Based on statements by the company in earnings calls , either proactively or in response to analysts ’ questions , companies were classified into one of three groups : Two companies were affected by both the 2019 Listing and the 2022 Controls and were included in both groups . Figure 1 provides an overview of the population . The study then compared cumulative absolute R & D spending ( in reporting currency ) and the number of patent filings in the two years before and after the implementation of the respective controls . A normalized , non-weighted average was calculated for each group to mitigate quarterly fluctuations and prevent the largest companies from skewing results . The outcome is summarized in Figure 2 : In the two years following the 2019 Listing , both impacted and non-impacted companies increased their R & D spending by approximately 30 percent compared to the two years prior to the controls . Similarly , patent filings rose by 21 percent and 12 percent , respectively . Accepting R & D spending and patent filings as proxies for a company ’ s innovative capacity , the data for the 2019 Listing therefore does not indicate a decline in the impacted companies ’ innovativeness—either in absolute terms or relative to non-impacted peers . This qualitative finding is further supported by a manual analysis of the impacted companies ’ quarterly earnings call transcripts over the post–2019 Listing period : the vast majority of company management remained optimistic about innovation , frequently announcing expanded R & D spending . Not a single instance was found when company management reported declining innovation as a result of the controls . The 2022 Controls present an even more pronounced and surprising picture . Impacted companies increased their R & D spending by 68 percent compared to a 27 percent increase among non-impacted peers . A patent analysis for this period is not yet possible due to an 18-month lag between patent filing and publication . As with the 2019 Listing , the quantitative findings for the 2022 Controls are corroborated by earnings call statements : company management consistently conveyed a positive and confident outlook on their R & D efforts to the capital markets . Finally , while the companies ’ revenue development in reaction to the two specific events was not a focus of this study – corporate revenues and profits , while a precondition , do not necessarily have to be invested in innovation – the qualitative results are the same . A financial analyst with a narrow focus on companies ’ financial performance and earnings calls may not find the results of this analysis surprising . However , it might be unexpected for policymakers and offer new aspects for academic research on export controls . For instance , a comprehensive analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York of U.S. export controls since 1997 across all industries identified negative abnormal stock returns , a reduction in bank lending , and declines in profitability and employment as consequences . To make sense of this more focused study ’ s findings , a closer look at the semiconductor industry ’ s situation during the relevant time period and the specific nature of the most recent export controls might help . Four explanations are possible : These factors—and how they will develop over time—provide important hints as to whether future export control restrictions will have material collateral effects or not . Innovation is the lifeblood of the semiconductor industry . The industry , and by extension national security as well as commercial applications , have benefited like few others from international cooperation and access to global markets . Semiconductor innovation is key to a digitalized and decarbonized future . The full , long-term impact of limiting market access and diverging technological spheres on semiconductor companies remains to be fully understood . A comprehensive net assessment of technology ecosystems must not only be analytically rigorous but also consider respective government actions to promote domestic industries . Part of this comprehensive assessment should explore secondary effects , such as whether a market share loss ( “ design-out ” ) of U.S. and allied semiconductor companies is indirectly caused by export controls or simply a result of China ’ s concurrent efforts to establish domestic supply chains for critical technologies . The findings of this study should not be interpreted as an endorsement for policymakers to indiscriminately expand export controls . The implications of such measures necessitate careful consideration and strategic implementation to avoid unintended consequences . In invoking export controls , the government should continue to focus on clear , narrowly defined national security rationales and transparently communicate those to market participants . This is especially important since barriers that would affect commercial success and innovation in the semiconductor industry also impact progress towards shared global responsibilities such as electrification and decarbonization : the national security prerogative should be made clear , and the trade-offs need to be at least understood if not accepted . Understanding the market dynamics and competitive situation of affected industries is paramount to target controls , and also to conceive , if needed , supportive industrial policy . Given the breadth of responsibilities of export control agencies in the U.S. and allied countries , governments need to staff them sufficiently , and ensure direct , regular information exchange with industry participants . For these exchanges to be impactful and fact-based , the governments should conduct regular economic impact analyses of their export controls and build an independent knowledge base of market and competitive dynamics . Multilateral export controls are more effective than unilateral controls , and the United States should continue to work with allies on an aligned approach , preferably in a suitable overall framework . In addition to being more effective , a multilateral approach also ensures a level playing field among U.S. and allied companies .

US,www.csis.org,news,"November 24, 2025",The True Impact of Allied Export Controls on the U.S. and Chinese Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment Industries,"Photo: PonyWang via Getty Images Report by Gregory C. Allen Published November 26, 2024 There is a fierce debate in the United States and among its allies about the impacts of export controls, and nowhere is that debate more heated than in the semiconductor equipment manufacturing industry. Too often, however, this debate occurs without any grounding in real-world data or relevant historical Chinese policy context. This paper seeks to provide some of that grounding through a combination of Chinese policy document analysis and new financial and market share data for leading semiconductor equipment firms in China, the United States, Japan, and the Netherlands. What follows are a set of 10 key judgments based on the author’s analysis. 1. China’s ambitions for eliminating dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturing equipment started long before America’s expanded usage of technology export controls. The first and most important argument among critics of U.S. export controls is that they weaken U.S. technology leadership by incentivizing China to eliminate U.S. technology from its semiconductor supply chain. However, reducing dependence on foreign semiconductor and semiconductor manufacturing equipment suppliers was official Chinese policy before the Trump administration’s April 2018 export controls restricting sales of U.S.-designed chips to ZTE, a Chinese telecommunications firm, launched the new era of semiconductor export controls. “ The Roadmap of Major Technical Domains for Made in China 2025 ,” which was published in September 2015 and covered semiconductors and other sectors, included goals such as “replacement of imports with Chinese-made products basically achieved in key industries” by 2025. It set specific targets and deadlines for the degree of market share that Chinese companies were supposed to reach and by what date. Targets for the semiconductor manufacturing equipment sector include the following: As the Made in China 2025 technical document roadmap stated , “meeting domestic market demand, improving the self-sufficiency rate of integrated circuit products, meeting national security needs, and occupying the strategic product market have always been the greatest demand and driving force for the development of the integrated circuit industry.” Even earlier policies, though less well resourced, sought to dramatically reduce use of foreign semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. For example, the 2006 “Medium Long Range Plan for the Development of Science and Technology” explicitly called for self-sufficiency in semiconductor technologies and initiated so-called “mega projects” to drive toward that goal. For more than a decade, China’s government has provided lavish subsidies in the form of tax breaks, free land, government grants, and equity infusions to a number of Chinese semiconductor equipment companies. Naura, one of China’s leading domestic semiconductor manufacturing equipment companies received $1.3 billion in state support in 2021, even before the imposition of the Biden administration’s export controls. AMEC, another leading Chinese semiconductor equipment company, received a similar equity investment from the “Big Fund” in 2015. Simply put, China’s goal of semiconductor equipment industry localization and robust policy support predated any modern effort to impose meaningful export controls on China’s chip fabrication capabilities. 2. There is not a simple relationship between export controls and China’s rate of technological progress. China’s greatest progress came in sectors with no export controls. A September 2024 analysis by Bernstein Research , an equity research firm, included a review of China’s semiconductor self-sufficiency goals from the 2015 roadmap and found that “China has made impressive progress and likely will beat the ‘Made in China 2025’ targets for integrated circuit (IC) Design and Manufacturing, but may miss the goals for IC equipment and Materials.” As the Bernstein analysis shows, the rate of China’s progress toward self-sufficiency is best predicted by the market and technological complexities of each semiconductor market segment, not by the extent to which export controls were applied. It is certainly not the case that the segments in which China has made the most progress—or even devoted the most resources—are the areas in which the United States has applied export controls most forcefully. That there is not a simple relationship between export controls and China’s technological progress should be obvious given that China has made rapid progress in other technological domains—such as solar cells and electric vehicles (EVs)—where the United States applied no export controls and in some cases actively supported the rise of a Chinese supply chain. The United States applied no export controls in the case of the equipment used to manufacture silicon solar cells, yet today China dominates both production of solar cells and production of the equipment used to make them. This equipment is in many ways similar to (though less sophisticated than) the equipment used to make and process silicon wafers for semiconductors. In fact, one Chinese company, Naura, is a domestic leader in both manufacturing equipment for both solar cells and semiconductors. The biggest difference in Chinese outcomes between those two industries is not the presence or absence of export controls but the far greater technological complexity of producing semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The EV maker Tesla made a major push into Chinese manufacturing in late 2018, launching deep partnerships with many local Chinese suppliers, such as battery-maker CATL. As a November 2024 commentary in a major Chinese state-run newspaper stated : ""Tesla’s rapid growth in sales, fueled by its technological and branding advantages and backed by China’s massive consumer market, has driven the rapid development of upstream and downstream supply chains. Today, the localization rate of parts for Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory exceeds 95%, with more than 60 suppliers integrated into Tesla’s global supply chain."" The Chinese EV supply chain, which Tesla helped dramatically increase in both scale and technological sophistication, is now also supplying Tesla’s competitors . Defections of Tesla-trained skilled employees are also a challenge. An April 2024 New York Times report claimed that most of Tesla’s early Chinese employees now work at competing Chinese firms. In a January Tesla earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said “The Chinese car companies are the most competitive car companies in the world. . . . Frankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other companies in the world.” The point here is not to suggest with unwarranted certainty that export controls would have definitively prevented China’s rise in the solar and EV industries. Rather, it is to caution the reader against relying too heavily on cursory anecdotal evidence to reach conclusions about when export controls do or do not work and what the counterfactual outcome would have been if export controls were or were not applied. Much depends upon the state of the global market landscape, the complexity of the controlled technology, the current technological sophistication of the targeted country, the design of the export control regulations, and the robustness of the controls’ implementation and enforcement. Only a detailed analysis can hope to reach anything approaching insight. 3. Semiconductor export controls—as implemented thus far—have in different ways and at different times both helped and hindered Chinese firms. Just as foreign firms have supported Chinese competitor growth in solar cells and EVs in the absence of export controls, so have they done in semiconductor manufacturing. The major semiconductor manufacturing equipment providers all have major service businesses, where, among other things, they train customer companies on how to get the most out of their equipment. Prior to the October 2022 changes in U.S. export controls, this could include assisting with the facility planning, installation, repairs, and operational troubleshooting of equipment as part of advanced chip manufacturing operations. Industry sources told CSIS that this sometimes included contract research and development (R&D) of advanced node semiconductor process technology on behalf of or in partnership with Chinese clients. At least as of November 2024, this is still legal in the case of providing support to Chinese legacy chip manufacturing operations. By contrast, earlier U.S. export controls meaningfully reversed progress in some segments of the Chinese semiconductor sector, such as NAND memory manufacturing and smartphone chip design , though the durability of those setbacks, even if temporary, will depend on many factors. More recent export controls have also made life harder in many ways for Chinese semiconductor equipment firms, who can no longer legally obtain U.S. subcomponents or technical expertise. Thus, it is simply wrong to say that export controls always, in isolation, accelerate Chinese technological indigenization and that making it easier for U.S. firms to export will always slow Chinese indigenization. At the same time, it is unambiguously the case that the United States’ use of semiconductor export controls, beginning with ZTE in April 2018, made a massive impression on both political and corporate leaders in China. Speeches at the time by Chinese leadership, including General Secretary Xi Jinping , indicate that ZTE was viewed as a turning point and justified China’s aggressive pursuit of “self-reliance” in science and technology. Pony Ma, the chairman of Tencent, one of China’s largest technology firms, said in May 2018, “The recent ZTE incident made us see clearly that no matter how advanced our mobile payment is, without mobile devices, without microchips and operating systems, we can’t compete competently.” The evidence goes beyond talk to specific actions. China made significant changes to its semiconductor policy in the years following ZTE, and China’s central government directed local governments to “do everything in their power” to promote the semiconductor sector. Some Chinese companies also took drastic measures to respond after ZTE. For example, Nikkei Asia reported that Yangtze Memory Technologies Corporation (YMTC)—one of China’s most advanced semiconductor manufacturers—began a full-blown de-Americanization campaign in 2019 involving the full-time work of more than 800 staff (both YMTC and its suppliers). This included the establishment of multiple new major partnerships with domestic Chinese equipment producers. Of note, at the time when YMTC began this de-Americanization initiative, no significant U.S. export controls applied to the company. YMTC began their work based on fear of future controls, not the reality of current ones. Combined, this provides strong evidence that the export controls did increase the desire of both the Chinese government and Chinese companies to increase the capabilities of local semiconductor equipment providers, but that is not the same thing as saying that export controls caused accelerated indigenization, which depends upon more than just desire. 4. The Biden administration’s 2022 export controls strengthened a policy approach to semiconductor equipment controls that began in 2019 during the first Trump administration. As with chip export controls, the first Trump administration launched the U.S. government’s modern approach to semiconductor manufacturing equipment export controls. According to reporting by Reuters , the U.S. government successfully persuaded the Dutch government in July 2019 to cancel the export license of EUV lithography equipment to SMIC, China’s most advanced logic chip foundry. In December 2020, SMIC was added to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Entity List, prohibiting the company from buying certain kinds of U.S. equipment, specifically, “items uniquely required for production of semiconductors at advanced technology nodes (10 nanometers and below, including extreme ultraviolet technology).” In October 2022, the Biden administration significantly expanded U.S. export controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment, including not only Entity List and end-use restrictions but also some country-wide export controls that applied to China as a whole (including a use of the U.S. persons rule). Just as importantly, the Biden administration made some of these controls more multilateral in nature, engaging Japan and the Netherlands to overhaul their export control policies for advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Even though these controls did not entirely align with U.S. controls, this was important to ensure that Dutch and Japanese companies did not provide China with alternative sources for the items that the United States was no longer willing to sell. 5. Chinese semiconductor equipment firms started very small but have grown rapidly. However, this rapid growth occurred both before and after export controls and took place during a period of massive Chinese equipment demand growth. China’s domestic semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry has long been both small and technologically inferior to the global state of the art. To understand the growth trajectory of the Chinese semiconductor manufacturing equipment sector, CSIS gathered market data on how China’s global semiconductor manufacturing equipment market share has changed over time across both supply and demand (see Table 1). China has grown as both a supplier and as a buyer of semiconductor manufacturing equipment over the past 15 years. And while Chinese firms have in aggregate increased China’s share of global supply, they remain quite small in comparison to foreign firms, providing only 3.2 percent of the equipment (by dollar value) globally and 9.6 percent of the equipment purchased by customers operating in China in 2023 (see Figure 1). Some industry sources, such as the research firm Sanford Bernstein, estimate that the Chinese domestic market share captured by Chinese equipment providers (aka Chinese self-sufficiency) is 15 percent. Whether the true figure is closer to 9.6 percent or 15 percent, the equipment that Chinese firms sell remains almost exclusively confined to legacy nodes and remains far behind the global state of the art. However, industry sources have told CSIS that Chinese equipment has grown in competitiveness compared with the legacy node equipment sold by leading global suppliers. Until the Biden administration’s October 2022 export controls , it was generally legal to sell critical subcomponents or expert consulting services to Chinese equipment firms, assisting with their growth in both sales and technological knowhow. In addition to voluntary foreign support, Chinese firms have benefitted from industrial espionage that has included state-backed cyberattacks on equipment companies. Chinese equipment firms have also benefitted from hundreds of billions of dollars in government investments, tax credits, and subsidies. 6. R&D expenditures by Chinese semiconductor firms have grown explosively, though the rate of growth has decreased somewhat since 2021. Using public financial filings, CSIS has collected R&D expenditure data from the eight largest publicly traded Chinese semiconductor equipment firms (see Figure 3). As the above data shows, the Chinese semiconductor equipment industry started out with comparatively low R&D expenditure but has shown extraordinary growth since the beginning of the Made in China 2025 policy era in 2015. Relative growth rates of R&D have slowed in the industry over the past two years, but growth in absolute terms remains very high. This data is not consistent with a simple story of “export controls caused a boom in the Chinese semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry” and instead shows that annual growth rates were very high both before and after the United States began imposing export controls. One plausible interpretation of the data is that U.S. and Dutch export controls in the 2018–2020 period increased desire among both the Chinese government and Chinese equipment customers in strengthening the local equipment industry, but they did so without making it more difficult for Chinese firms to obtain help—even from U.S. experts and equipment subcomponent providers. The export controls of 2022 and 2023 may have further increased interest among the Chinese government and customers, but such interest and ability to productively absorb additional investment was already nearly maxed out. However, the export controls of 2022 and 2023 also took extensive steps (e.g., extensive application of the Foreign Direct Product Rule and the U.S. persons rule, multilateralization of the controls) to make it more difficult for Chinese firms to obtain foreign help in advancing the reliability and competitiveness of their technology. Thus, the pace of revenue and R&D expenditure growth among Chinese equipment providers slowed somewhat (while remaining high in absolute terms). Again, this is a plausible interpretation that is consistent with the available data, but the available data is not sufficient in and of itself to definitively state that this is the correct interpretation. Another plausible interpretation for slowing pace of growth—discussed in the next section—is that Chinese customers for semiconductor manufacturing equipment dramatically accelerated equipment purchases in an effort to stockpile equipment in anticipation of future export controls and that this surge of foreign imports stockpiling temporarily reduced demand growth for domestic equipment (while not changing China’s long-term commitment to end reliance on imports). There are some limitations in the R&D data, as not all of the companies are exclusively focused on the semiconductor equipment industry. Naura, for example, has lithium battery and photovoltaic business units which industry sources told CSIS are responsible for about 18 percent of the firm’s revenue (and presumably comprised a comparable share of its R&D for at least some period), but these are not broken out in the firm’s public financial reporting. Additionally, there are important Chinese semiconductor equipment firms that are not included in this analysis, such as Shanghai Microelectronics Equipment (SMEE) and Huawei’s recently established semiconductor equipment subsidiaries, because they do report such data publicly. The absence of Huawei’s semiconductor equipment subsidiaries, in particular, could be an important missing source of data. Huawei’s private investment in R&D and the semiconductor equipment that it produces for its own secret network of chip manufacturers would not be captured in any of the data sources used in this report. In October 2023, the Dutch newspaper NRC , citing anonymous ASML employees, reported that an employee who stole significant semiconductor manufacturing equipment technology secrets moved to China and now works for Huawei. This suggests that Huawei is making a significant investment in lithography equipment, as does a 2022 Huawei patent filed under the name “Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography.” While these complications mean that the specific R&D values as presented have an error bar, the overall trajectory characterized is likely close to the reality of the Chinese semiconductor equipment industry as a whole. 7. In the 2016–2024 period, leading U.S. and international semiconductor equipment firms continued to demonstrate strong Chinese revenue growth after imposition of increasingly strict export controls. The top three U.S. semiconductor manufacturing equipment providers are Applied Materials, Lam Research, and KLA Corporation. Together with ASML of the Netherlands and Tokyo Electron and Advantest of Japan, they comprise the six largest semiconductor equipment providers in the world by revenue. In their financial reports, these firms report the share of their revenue derived from China (not including Taiwan). CSIS extracted and aggregated this data to show that these firms have grown revenue in China both before and after the United States began imposing export controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment. For the top three U.S. providers, Chinese revenue growth outperformed growth in the rest of the world every year in the 2016–2024E period. Similarly, ASML, the Dutch lithography equipment firm, also saw dramatic growth in sales of equipment to China that exceeded growth in the rest of the world. Finally, the same is true of Tokyo Electron and Advantest, the two leading Japanese equipment providers. Both saw superior performance in China compared with the rest of the world. The most likely explanation for this is that Chinese firms have shifted their purchases of international equipment earlier so that they occurred prior to expected future export controls (which the U.S. government has maintained since 2022 will be updated annually). Just as Huawei built up a U.S. chip stockpile equivalent to multiple years of demand during a period prior to U.S. export control loopholes being closed, Chinese semiconductor manufacturers have acquired a stockpile of U.S. and other foreign equipment in anticipation of strengthened export controls coming in the near future. This “pulling demand forward” interpretation is the one that many executives in the semiconductor equipment industry have evidently reached. In July 2024, both the CEO of ASML and the CEO of ASM said during investor earnings calls that Chinese semiconductor manufacturers would likely decrease purchases of equipment soon, as they have struggled to “digest” all of the accelerated purchases of equipment and spare parts that they have made, effectively confirming that many tools that have been sold to China are still likely awaiting installation and remain unused. Similarly, in August 2024, a Lam Research executive likewise described “inventory stocking” behavior among Chinese customers over the past several years. 8. Export controls changed the composition of equipment demand both technologically (decreasing the technological sophistication of demand in China) and geographically (shifting more demand outside of China) but likely did not change the overall demand trajectory. Decades before the Trump administration’s April 2018 export controls on ZTE ushered in the modern era of semiconductor export controls, the U.S. policy goal for exports of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China was already to restrict sales of advanced equipment to trusted U.S. allies and partners while allowing the sale of older, less advanced equipment to China. A 2002 U.S. government policy review of semiconductor technology exports to China stated this explicitly. Neither the Trump administration nor the Biden administration fundamentally changed this approach at a high level. Both administrations continued to allow the sale of legacy equipment, though they increased restrictions on sales of advanced equipment exports. In the case of the Biden administration, it also communicated an intent to end the “sliding scale” approach that allowed the sophistication of equipment exports to China to advance, but on a multiyear delay from the global state of the art. As such, China has continued to be a large and growing market for equipment exports even after the more recent export controls, but Chinese firms have changed their focus from a rush to compete at the most advanced semiconductor technological nodes to maximizing both domestic self-sufficiency and global leadership in legacy chip production. China was likely to pursue a massive expansion of chip production capacity regardless of U.S. actions, but the export controls helped ensure that this capacity did not drive the U.S. and allies toward a strategic dependence on China for the most technologically advanced chips, such as those that power AI systems or high-end smartphones. Moreover, the overall demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment fundamentally depends on the overall demand for manufactured chips. As the demand for advanced chips grows, that demand will translate into demand for advanced equipment. And if China is not in a position to purchase advanced equipment, then the purchase and production will instead take place outside of China. The chief financial officer of ASML, Roger Dassen, said this explicitly during ASML’s July 2024 earnings call with investment analysts: "". . . the way we look at the demand for our tools is not from a specific geography. In this case, China. We look at—and that's the way we model our sales medium term and long term. We look at what is the global demand for wafers and whether those wafers are being produced in country X or country Y, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. And I think that is very important to recognize in looking at your model. We don't have a specific China element in our models. It is the global demand for wafers that drives our modeling."" Accordingly, U.S. and allied controls did not so much destroy demand as change its composition. China is buying fewer advanced tools than it would have otherwise and is instead purchasing more legacy tools. The advanced tools that would have been sold to China have instead been sold to places like the United States, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and Europe. Likewise, given that many foreign players are wary of investing in legacy nodes due to fears of Chinese overcapacity, the tools are being largely sold to China for those production lines, not elsewhere. Chinese firms are also likely attempting to use many “node-agnostic” or “backwards compatible” equipment tools not subject to a control to bolster their advanced node efforts. 9. Increased application of semiconductor equipment export controls coincided with and likely caused U.S. equipment firms to ensure that sales to China did not ship from the United States and/or were manufactured outside the United States. CSIS has produced an estimate of the Chinese semiconductor equipment revenue of each of the top three U.S. semiconductor equipment companies by taking their topline revenue from China and subtracting the share reported as services and non-semiconductor equipment businesses (e.g., display, printed circuit board inspection). This figure would include any semiconductor manufacturing equipment sales to China from these three firms shipped from any of their facilities worldwide, whether those facilities are in the United States or elsewhere. U.S. trade data provided by the International Trade Commission (ITC) reports the dollar value of all U.S. exports based on six-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes. The NAICS Code for “Semiconductor Machinery Manufacturing” is 333242 , which covers all front-end semiconductor manufacturing equipment. CSIS collected ITC trade data for all U.S. exports of 333242 goods to China. This figure includes any semiconductor manufacturing equipment sales made from U.S. soil, whether those sales are made by U.S.-owned or internationally owned firms. In practice, the top three U.S. semiconductor manufacturing equipment companies—Applied Materials, Lam Research, and KLA Corporation—tend to dominate 333242 exports to nearly all countries. Based on these two datasets, one could see that U.S. equipment sales to China by U.S. firms have increasingly become exported from non-U.S. countries since 2016 and especially after 2019 (see Figure 7). From 2016 to 2020, the ratio of sales to exports grew 34 percent, from 1.1 to 1.5. However, from 2021 to 2024, the ratio nearly doubled, from 1.6 to 3.1. In other words, exports to China and sales to China used to be nearly identical, but sales overwhelmingly outgrew exports in the post-2020 period, the same period when the United States adopted significantly stricter export controls. Industry sources told CSIS that much of the change was originally due to U.S. firms seeking to legally avoid export controls that—in the absence of strict usage of the Foreign Direct Product Rule—only applied to exports from U.S. soil. This interpretation is consistent with the remarks of KLA CEO Rick Wallace, who discussed how some versions of U.S. semiconductor equipment export controls did not apply to U.S. companies manufacturing their equipment abroad and shipping from abroad during the company’s 2020 Q3 earnings call . The exchange is important and worth quoting at length: ""Question: Regarding the Department of Commerce ruling, and I know it's still very early, and I'm sure you're awaiting clarity on how broader now the rules will be pursued. But if you think about what's been written to date, the major ruling is for manufacturing in the U.S. and considering you do make tools and assemble tools offshore, is your first interpretation that you will not be impacted in terms of shipping into China based on kind of what you read today? Rick Wallace: Our understanding at this point is, this will impact the tools that are manufactured in the U.S., which are manufactured for us in California. We have three major manufacturing sites; Israel, Singapore and here. So there is a potential impact depending on the customer. And our final understanding of the ruling that [is that it] will impact tools that come out of California."" In short, export controls that do not include strict implementation and enforcement of the Foreign Direct Product Rule or U.S. persons rule can incentivize U.S. firms to move production offshore, costing the United States manufacturing jobs. In recent years, U.S. semiconductor manufacturing equipment firms have doubled-down and expanded their non-U.S. manufacturing operations. Both KLA Corporation and Applied Materials have committed to major expansions of their Singapore manufacturing facilities, while LAM Research has built out its largest manufacturing site in Malaysia. In quantitative terms, this is one of the most striking effects of the export controls as implemented thus far, and it clearly illustrates the risk that countries take by applying export controls that do not apply extraterritorially in industries where off-shoring some or all production is relatively easy. As one Japanese business executive stated , his company will “develop duplicate supply chains—one for the U.S.-led economic bloc and one for [the] China-led bloc.” Industry sources told CSIS that, more recently, both U.S. and international semiconductor equipment companies are being required by their Chinese customers to remove all U.S. citizens from their supply chain and ship from outside the United States when selling to China. This fact shows that there is really no turning back from the export control path that the United States and its allies have gone down. Half measures incur nearly all of the costs of an aggressive export control policy—in terms of incentivizing U.S. firm outsourcing, foreign substitution, and Chinese indigenous investment—while delivering comparatively few of the strategic benefits. 10. There is no change in U.S. or allied policy that will persuade the Chinese government and Chinese firms to abandon their semiconductor equipment de-Americanization and decoupling efforts. However, the United States can take steps to make those efforts more difficult and to extract more strategic benefits in semiconductor and AI competition. Critics of export controls oftentimes make two related arguments. First, revenues from China can be reinvested in R&D and thus contribute to increased U.S. technological competitiveness, including against Chinese firms. Second, prohibiting exports increases willingness on the part of Chinese firms and the Chinese government to invest in competitors to U.S. firms, decreasing U.S. technological competitiveness. However, these arguments assume that the strategic approach of the Chinese government and Chinese firms depends solely or primarily upon U.S. actions, which is contradicted by the review of Chinese policy at the beginning of this paper and from the experience of the EV and solar industries. Consider a thought experiment: What would be the likely policy response of the Chinese government if the United States decided to begin unrestricted exports of nuclear submarines to China? U.S. nuclear submarines are widely regarded as the best in the world, and China’s spies have long devoted major efforts to stealing U.S. submarine technology secrets. Presumably, therefore, China would leap at the chance to buy U.S. nuclear submarines on the open market. And, under the logic of the above two arguments—increased U.S. revenue and decreased Chinese investment—these sales would increase, not decrease, the U.S. technological advantage in nuclear submarine technology. Are American policymakers fools for using export controls to block nuclear submarine sales to China? Of course not. Even if a hypothetical reckless U.S. president and Congress were to allow China to buy as many submarines as U.S. firms could make, China would never accept that this state of affairs is likely to continue on a permanent basis. China would obviously take the submarines they could get and reverse engineer the technology as fast as possible and transfer that technology to their domestic submarine industry, which they would continue to financially support. The increased revenue from R&D for U.S. firms is not going to make nearly as much of a difference as China’s hands-on opportunity to reverse engineer U.S. technology. Neither would the lost sales among Chinese submarine manufacturers decrease China’s commitment to supporting a domestic industry. This is not to even mention the grave risks to national security of a hypothetical Chinese navy equipped with U.S.-built nuclear submarines. This admittedly extreme thought experiment bears consideration because, while some in the West question whether semiconductor manufacturing equipment deserves to be viewed as a strategic technology of major importance to national security, China’s leaders do not. This belief is evident not only in words but also the deeds, whether that be Chinese state-backed espionage against equipment firms, aggressive reverse engineering of purchased Western equipment, or the astonishing amount of financial resources dedicated to indigenization. There is simply no policy that the United States could articulate that would persuade China to abandon its goals of de-Americanization and decoupling in the semiconductor equipment sector. As the United States and allied governments consider reforms to semiconductor equipment controls, they should focus less on how to change China’s goals and more on how to make achieving those goals as expensive and complicated as possible.

Allen Published November 26, 2024 There is a fierce debate in the United States and among its allies about the impacts of export controls, and nowhere is that debate more heated than in the semiconductor equipment manufacturing industry. Too often, however, this debate occurs without any grounding in real-world data or relevant historical Chinese policy context. This paper seeks to provide some of that grounding through a combination of Chinese policy document analysis and new financial and market share data for leading semiconductor equipment firms in China, the United States, Japan, and the Netherlands. What follows are a set of 10 key judgments based on the author’s analysis. 1. China’s ambitions for eliminating dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturing equipment started long before America’s expanded usage of technology export controls. The first and most important argument among critics of U.S. export controls is that they weaken U.S. technology leadership by incentivizing China to eliminate U.S. technology from its semiconductor supply chain. However, reducing dependence on foreign semiconductor and semiconductor manufacturing equipment suppliers was official Chinese policy before the Trump administration’s April 2018 export controls restricting sales of U.S.-designed chips to ZTE, a Chinese telecommunications firm, launched the new era of semiconductor export controls. “ The Roadmap of Major Technical Domains for Made in China 2025 ,” which was published in September 2015 and covered semiconductors and other sectors, included goals such as “replacement of imports with Chinese-made products basically achieved in key industries” by 2025. It set specific targets and deadlines for the degree of market share that Chinese companies were supposed to reach and by what date. Targets for the semiconductor manufacturing equipment sector include the following: As the Made in China 2025 technical document roadmap stated , “meeting domestic market demand, improving the self-sufficiency rate of integrated circuit products, meeting national security needs, and occupying the strategic product market have always been the greatest demand and driving force for the development of the integrated circuit industry.” Even earlier policies, though less well resourced, sought to dramatically reduce use of foreign semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. For example, the 2006 “Medium Long Range Plan for the Development of Science and Technology” explicitly called for self-sufficiency in semiconductor technologies and initiated so-called “mega projects” to drive toward that goal. For more than a decade, China’s government has provided lavish subsidies in the form of tax breaks, free land, government grants, and equity infusions to a number of Chinese semiconductor equipment companies. Naura, one of China’s leading domestic semiconductor manufacturing equipment companies received $1.3 billion in state support in 2021, even before the imposition of the Biden administration’s export controls. AMEC, another leading Chinese semiconductor equipment company, received a similar equity investment from the “Big Fund” in 2015. Simply put, China’s goal of semiconductor equipment industry localization and robust policy support predated any modern effort to impose meaningful export controls on China’s chip fabrication capabilities. 2. There is not a simple relationship between export controls and China’s rate of technological progress. China’s greatest progress came in sectors with no export controls. A September 2024 analysis by Bernstein Research , an equity research firm, included a review of China’s semiconductor self-sufficiency goals from the 2015 roadmap and found that “China has made impressive progress and likely will beat the ‘Made in China 2025’ targets for integrated circuit (IC) Design and Manufacturing, but may miss the goals for IC equipment and Materials.” As the Bernstein analysis shows, the rate of China’s progress toward self-sufficiency is best predicted by the market and technological complexities of each semiconductor market segment, not by the extent to which export controls were applied. It is certainly not the case that the segments in which China has made the most progress—or even devoted the most resources—are the areas in which the United States has applied export controls most forcefully. That there is not a simple relationship between export controls and China’s technological progress should be obvious given that China has made rapid progress in other technological domains—such as solar cells and electric vehicles (EVs)—where the United States applied no export controls and in some cases actively supported the rise of a Chinese supply chain. The United States applied no export controls in the case of the equipment used to manufacture silicon solar cells, yet today China dominates both production of solar cells and production of the equipment used to make them. This equipment is in many ways similar to (though less sophisticated than) the equipment used to make and process silicon wafers for semiconductors. In fact, one Chinese company, Naura, is a domestic leader in both manufacturing equipment for both solar cells and semiconductors. The biggest difference in Chinese outcomes between those two industries is not the presence or absence of export controls but the far greater technological complexity of producing semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The EV maker Tesla made a major push into Chinese manufacturing in late 2018, launching deep partnerships with many local Chinese suppliers, such as battery-maker CATL. As a November 2024 commentary in a major Chinese state-run newspaper stated : ""Tesla’s rapid growth in sales, fueled by its technological and branding advantages and backed by China’s massive consumer market, has driven the rapid development of upstream and downstream supply chains. Today, the localization rate of parts for Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory exceeds 95%, with more than 60 suppliers integrated into Tesla’s global supply chain."" The Chinese EV supply chain, which Tesla helped dramatically increase in both scale and technological sophistication, is now also supplying Tesla’s competitors . Defections of Tesla-trained skilled employees are also a challenge. An April 2024 New York Times report claimed that most of Tesla’s early Chinese employees now work at competing Chinese firms. In a January Tesla earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said “The Chinese car companies are the most competitive car companies in the world. . . . Frankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other companies in the world.” The point here is not to suggest with unwarranted certainty that export controls would have definitively prevented China’s rise in the solar and EV industries. Rather, it is to caution the reader against relying too heavily on cursory anecdotal evidence to reach conclusions about when export controls do or do not work and what the counterfactual outcome would have been if export controls were or were not applied. Much depends upon the state of the global market landscape, the complexity of the controlled technology, the current technological sophistication of the targeted country, the design of the export control regulations, and the robustness of the controls’ implementation and enforcement. Only a detailed analysis can hope to reach anything approaching insight. 3. Semiconductor export controls—as implemented thus far—have in different ways and at different times both helped and hindered Chinese firms. Just as foreign firms have supported Chinese competitor growth in solar cells and EVs in the absence of export controls, so have they done in semiconductor manufacturing. The major semiconductor manufacturing equipment providers all have major service businesses, where, among other things, they train customer companies on how to get the most out of their equipment. Prior to the October 2022 changes in U.S. export controls, this could include assisting with the facility planning, installation, repairs, and operational troubleshooting of equipment as part of advanced chip manufacturing operations. Industry sources told CSIS that this sometimes included contract research and development (R&D) of advanced node semiconductor process technology on behalf of or in partnership with Chinese clients. At least as of November 2024, this is still legal in the case of providing support to Chinese legacy chip manufacturing operations. By contrast, earlier U.S. export controls meaningfully reversed progress in some segments of the Chinese semiconductor sector, such as NAND memory manufacturing and smartphone chip design , though the durability of those setbacks, even if temporary, will depend on many factors. More recent export controls have also made life harder in many ways for Chinese semiconductor equipment firms, who can no longer legally obtain U.S. subcomponents or technical expertise. Thus, it is simply wrong to say that export controls always, in isolation, accelerate Chinese technological indigenization and that making it easier for U.S. firms to export will always slow Chinese indigenization. At the same time, it is unambiguously the case that the United States’ use of semiconductor export controls, beginning with ZTE in April 2018, made a massive impression on both political and corporate leaders in China. Speeches at the time by Chinese leadership, including General Secretary Xi Jinping , indicate that ZTE was viewed as a turning point and justified China’s aggressive pursuit of “self-reliance” in science and technology. Pony Ma, the chairman of Tencent, one of China’s largest technology firms, said in May 2018, “The recent ZTE incident made us see clearly that no matter how advanced our mobile payment is, without mobile devices, without microchips and operating systems, we can’t compete competently.” The evidence goes beyond talk to specific actions. China made significant changes to its semiconductor policy in the years following ZTE, and China’s central government directed local governments to “do everything in their power” to promote the semiconductor sector. Some Chinese companies also took drastic measures to respond after ZTE. For example, Nikkei Asia reported that Yangtze Memory Technologies Corporation (YMTC)—one of China’s most advanced semiconductor manufacturers—began a full-blown de-Americanization campaign in 2019 involving the full-time work of more than 800 staff (both YMTC and its suppliers). This included the establishment of multiple new major partnerships with domestic Chinese equipment producers. Of note, at the time when YMTC began this de-Americanization initiative, no significant U.S. export controls applied to the company. YMTC began their work based on fear of future controls, not the reality of current ones. Combined, this provides strong evidence that the export controls did increase the desire of both the Chinese government and Chinese companies to increase the capabilities of local semiconductor equipment providers, but that is not the same thing as saying that export controls caused accelerated indigenization, which depends upon more than just desire. 4. The Biden administration’s 2022 export controls strengthened a policy approach to semiconductor equipment controls that began in 2019 during the first Trump administration. As with chip export controls, the first Trump administration launched the U.S. government’s modern approach to semiconductor manufacturing equipment export controls. According to reporting by Reuters , the U.S. government successfully persuaded the Dutch government in July 2019 to cancel the export license of EUV lithography equipment to SMIC, China’s most advanced logic chip foundry. In December 2020, SMIC was added to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Entity List, prohibiting the company from buying certain kinds of U.S. equipment, specifically, “items uniquely required for production of semiconductors at advanced technology nodes (10 nanometers and below, including extreme ultraviolet technology).” In October 2022, the Biden administration significantly expanded U.S. export controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment, including not only Entity List and end-use restrictions but also some country-wide export controls that applied to China as a whole (including a use of the U.S. persons rule). Just as importantly, the Biden administration made some of these controls more multilateral in nature, engaging Japan and the Netherlands to overhaul their export control policies for advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Even though these controls did not entirely align with U.S. controls, this was important to ensure that Dutch and Japanese companies did not provide China with alternative sources for the items that the United States was no longer willing to sell. 5. Chinese semiconductor equipment firms started very small but have grown rapidly. However, this rapid growth occurred both before and after export controls and took place during a period of massive Chinese equipment demand growth. China’s domestic semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry has long been both small and technologically inferior to the global state of the art. To understand the growth trajectory of the Chinese semiconductor manufacturing equipment sector, CSIS gathered market data on how China’s global semiconductor manufacturing equipment market share has changed over time across both supply and demand (see Table 1). China has grown as both a supplier and as a buyer of semiconductor manufacturing equipment over the past 15 years. And while Chinese firms have in aggregate increased China’s share of global supply, they remain quite small in comparison to foreign firms, providing only 3.2 percent of the equipment (by dollar value) globally and 9.6 percent of the equipment purchased by customers operating in China in 2023 (see Figure 1). Some industry sources, such as the research firm Sanford Bernstein, estimate that the Chinese domestic market share captured by Chinese equipment providers (aka Chinese self-sufficiency) is 15 percent. Whether the true figure is closer to 9.6 percent or 15 percent, the equipment that Chinese firms sell remains almost exclusively confined to legacy nodes and remains far behind the global state of the art. However, industry sources have told CSIS that Chinese equipment has grown in competitiveness compared with the legacy node equipment sold by leading global suppliers. Until the Biden administration’s October 2022 export controls , it was generally legal to sell critical subcomponents or expert consulting services to Chinese equipment firms, assisting with their growth in both sales and technological knowhow. In addition to voluntary foreign support, Chinese firms have benefitted from industrial espionage that has included state-backed cyberattacks on equipment companies. Chinese equipment firms have also benefitted from hundreds of billions of dollars in government investments, tax credits, and subsidies. 6. R&D expenditures by Chinese semiconductor firms have grown explosively, though the rate of growth has decreased somewhat since 2021. Using public financial filings, CSIS has collected R&D expenditure data from the eight largest publicly traded Chinese semiconductor equipment firms (see Figure 3). As the above data shows, the Chinese semiconductor equipment industry started out with comparatively low R&D expenditure but has shown extraordinary growth since the beginning of the Made in China 2025 policy era in 2015. Relative growth rates of R&D have slowed in the industry over the past two years, but growth in absolute terms remains very high. This data is not consistent with a simple story of “export controls caused a boom in the Chinese semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry” and instead shows that annual growth rates were very high both before and after the United States began imposing export controls. One plausible interpretation of the data is that U.S. and Dutch export controls in the 2018–2020 period increased desire among both the Chinese government and Chinese equipment customers in strengthening the local equipment industry, but they did so without making it more difficult for Chinese firms to obtain help—even from U.S. experts and equipment subcomponent providers. The export controls of 2022 and 2023 may have further increased interest among the Chinese government and customers, but such interest and ability to productively absorb additional investment was already nearly maxed out. However, the export controls of 2022 and 2023 also took extensive steps (e.g., extensive application of the Foreign Direct Product Rule and the U.S. persons rule, multilateralization of the controls) to make it more difficult for Chinese firms to obtain foreign help in advancing the reliability and competitiveness of their technology. Thus, the pace of revenue and R&D expenditure growth among Chinese equipment providers slowed somewhat (while remaining high in absolute terms). Again, this is a plausible interpretation that is consistent with the available data, but the available data is not sufficient in and of itself to definitively state that this is the correct interpretation. Another plausible interpretation for slowing pace of growth—discussed in the next section—is that Chinese customers for semiconductor manufacturing equipment dramatically accelerated equipment purchases in an effort to stockpile equipment in anticipation of future export controls and that this surge of foreign imports stockpiling temporarily reduced demand growth for domestic equipment (while not changing China’s long-term commitment to end reliance on imports). There are some limitations in the R&D data, as not all of the companies are exclusively focused on the semiconductor equipment industry. Naura, for example, has lithium battery and photovoltaic business units which industry sources told CSIS are responsible for about 18 percent of the firm’s revenue (and presumably comprised a comparable share of its R&D for at least some period), but these are not broken out in the firm’s public financial reporting. Additionally, there are important Chinese semiconductor equipment firms that are not included in this analysis, such as Shanghai Microelectronics Equipment (SMEE) and Huawei’s recently established semiconductor equipment subsidiaries, because they do report such data publicly. The absence of Huawei’s semiconductor equipment subsidiaries, in particular, could be an important missing source of data. Huawei’s private investment in R&D and the semiconductor equipment that it produces for its own secret network of chip manufacturers would not be captured in any of the data sources used in this report. In October 2023, the Dutch newspaper NRC , citing anonymous ASML employees, reported that an employee who stole significant semiconductor manufacturing equipment technology secrets moved to China and now works for Huawei. This suggests that Huawei is making a significant investment in lithography equipment, as does a 2022 Huawei patent filed under the name “Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography.” While these complications mean that the specific R&D values as presented have an error bar, the overall trajectory characterized is likely close to the reality of the Chinese semiconductor equipment industry as a whole. 7. In the 2016–2024 period, leading U.S. and international semiconductor equipment firms continued to demonstrate strong Chinese revenue growth after imposition of increasingly strict export controls. The top three U.S. semiconductor manufacturing equipment providers are Applied Materials, Lam Research, and KLA Corporation. Together with ASML of the Netherlands and Tokyo Electron and Advantest of Japan, they comprise the six largest semiconductor equipment providers in the world by revenue. In their financial reports, these firms report the share of their revenue derived from China (not including Taiwan). CSIS extracted and aggregated this data to show that these firms have grown revenue in China both before and after the United States began imposing export controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment. For the top three U.S. providers, Chinese revenue growth outperformed growth in the rest of the world every year in the 2016–2024E period. Similarly, ASML, the Dutch lithography equipment firm, also saw dramatic growth in sales of equipment to China that exceeded growth in the rest of the world. Finally, the same is true of Tokyo Electron and Advantest, the two leading Japanese equipment providers. Both saw superior performance in China compared with the rest of the world. The most likely explanation for this is that Chinese firms have shifted their purchases of international equipment earlier so that they occurred prior to expected future export controls (which the U.S. government has maintained since 2022 will be updated annually). Just as Huawei built up a U.S. chip stockpile equivalent to multiple years of demand during a period prior to U.S. export control loopholes being closed, Chinese semiconductor manufacturers have acquired a stockpile of U.S. and other foreign equipment in anticipation of strengthened export controls coming in the near future. This “pulling demand forward” interpretation is the one that many executives in the semiconductor equipment industry have evidently reached. In July 2024, both the CEO of ASML and the CEO of ASM said during investor earnings calls that Chinese semiconductor manufacturers would likely decrease purchases of equipment soon, as they have struggled to “digest” all of the accelerated purchases of equipment and spare parts that they have made, effectively confirming that many tools that have been sold to China are still likely awaiting installation and remain unused. Similarly, in August 2024, a Lam Research executive likewise described “inventory stocking” behavior among Chinese customers over the past several years. 8. Export controls changed the composition of equipment demand both technologically (decreasing the technological sophistication of demand in China) and geographically (shifting more demand outside of China) but likely did not change the overall demand trajectory. Decades before the Trump administration’s April 2018 export controls on ZTE ushered in the modern era of semiconductor export controls, the U.S. policy goal for exports of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China was already to restrict sales of advanced equipment to trusted U.S. allies and partners while allowing the sale of older, less advanced equipment to China. A 2002 U.S. government policy review of semiconductor technology exports to China stated this explicitly. Neither the Trump administration nor the Biden administration fundamentally changed this approach at a high level. Both administrations continued to allow the sale of legacy equipment, though they increased restrictions on sales of advanced equipment exports. In the case of the Biden administration, it also communicated an intent to end the “sliding scale” approach that allowed the sophistication of equipment exports to China to advance, but on a multiyear delay from the global state of the art. As such, China has continued to be a large and growing market for equipment exports even after the more recent export controls, but Chinese firms have changed their focus from a rush to compete at the most advanced semiconductor technological nodes to maximizing both domestic self-sufficiency and global leadership in legacy chip production. China was likely to pursue a massive expansion of chip production capacity regardless of U.S. actions, but the export controls helped ensure that this capacity did not drive the U.S. and allies toward a strategic dependence on China for the most technologically advanced chips, such as those that power AI systems or high-end smartphones. Moreover, the overall demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment fundamentally depends on the overall demand for manufactured chips. As the demand for advanced chips grows, that demand will translate into demand for advanced equipment. And if China is not in a position to purchase advanced equipment, then the purchase and production will instead take place outside of China. The chief financial officer of ASML, Roger Dassen, said this explicitly during ASML’s July 2024 earnings call with investment analysts: "". . . the way we look at the demand for our tools is not from a specific geography. In this case, China. We look at—and that's the way we model our sales medium term and long term. We look at what is the global demand for wafers and whether those wafers are being produced in country X or country Y, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. And I think that is very important to recognize in looking at your model. We don't have a specific China element in our models. It is the global demand for wafers that drives our modeling."" Accordingly, U.S. and allied controls did not so much destroy demand as change its composition. China is buying fewer advanced tools than it would have otherwise and is instead purchasing more legacy tools. The advanced tools that would have been sold to China have instead been sold to places like the United States, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and Europe. Likewise, given that many foreign players are wary of investing in legacy nodes due to fears of Chinese overcapacity, the tools are being largely sold to China for those production lines, not elsewhere. Chinese firms are also likely attempting to use many “node-agnostic” or “backwards compatible” equipment tools not subject to a control to bolster their advanced node efforts. 9. Increased application of semiconductor equipment export controls coincided with and likely caused U.S. equipment firms to ensure that sales to China did not ship from the United States and/or were manufactured outside the United States. CSIS has produced an estimate of the Chinese semiconductor equipment revenue of each of the top three U.S. semiconductor equipment companies by taking their topline revenue from China and subtracting the share reported as services and non-semiconductor equipment businesses (e.g., display, printed circuit board inspection). This figure would include any semiconductor manufacturing equipment sales to China from these three firms shipped from any of their facilities worldwide, whether those facilities are in the United States or elsewhere. U.S. trade data provided by the International Trade Commission (ITC) reports the dollar value of all U.S. exports based on six-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes. The NAICS Code for “Semiconductor Machinery Manufacturing” is 333242 , which covers all front-end semiconductor manufacturing equipment. CSIS collected ITC trade data for all U.S. exports of 333242 goods to China. This figure includes any semiconductor manufacturing equipment sales made from U.S. soil, whether those sales are made by U.S.-owned or internationally owned firms. In practice, the top three U.S. semiconductor manufacturing equipment companies—Applied Materials, Lam Research, and KLA Corporation—tend to dominate 333242 exports to nearly all countries. Based on these two datasets, one could see that U.S. equipment sales to China by U.S. firms have increasingly become exported from non-U.S. countries since 2016 and especially after 2019 (see Figure 7). From 2016 to 2020, the ratio of sales to exports grew 34 percent, from 1.1 to 1.5. However, from 2021 to 2024, the ratio nearly doubled, from 1.6 to 3.1. In other words, exports to China and sales to China used to be nearly identical, but sales overwhelmingly outgrew exports in the post-2020 period, the same period when the United States adopted significantly stricter export controls. Industry sources told CSIS that much of the change was originally due to U.S. firms seeking to legally avoid export controls that—in the absence of strict usage of the Foreign Direct Product Rule—only applied to exports from U.S. soil. This interpretation is consistent with the remarks of KLA CEO Rick Wallace, who discussed how some versions of U.S. semiconductor equipment export controls did not apply to U.S. companies manufacturing their equipment abroad and shipping from abroad during the company’s 2020 Q3 earnings call . The exchange is important and worth quoting at length: ""Question: Regarding the Department of Commerce ruling, and I know it's still very early, and I'm sure you're awaiting clarity on how broader now the rules will be pursued. But if you think about what's been written to date, the major ruling is for manufacturing in the U.S. and considering you do make tools and assemble tools offshore, is your first interpretation that you will not be impacted in terms of shipping into China based on kind of what you read today? Rick Wallace: Our understanding at this point is, this will impact the tools that are manufactured in the U.S., which are manufactured for us in California. We have three major manufacturing sites; Israel, Singapore and here. So there is a potential impact depending on the customer. And our final understanding of the ruling that [is that it] will impact tools that come out of California."" In short, export controls that do not include strict implementation and enforcement of the Foreign Direct Product Rule or U.S. persons rule can incentivize U.S. firms to move production offshore, costing the United States manufacturing jobs. In recent years, U.S. semiconductor manufacturing equipment firms have doubled-down and expanded their non-U.S. manufacturing operations. Both KLA Corporation and Applied Materials have committed to major expansions of their Singapore manufacturing facilities, while LAM Research has built out its largest manufacturing site in Malaysia. In quantitative terms, this is one of the most striking effects of the export controls as implemented thus far, and it clearly illustrates the risk that countries take by applying export controls that do not apply extraterritorially in industries where off-shoring some or all production is relatively easy. As one Japanese business executive stated , his company will “develop duplicate supply chains—one for the U.S.-led economic bloc and one for [the] China-led bloc.” Industry sources told CSIS that, more recently, both U.S. and international semiconductor equipment companies are being required by their Chinese customers to remove all U.S. citizens from their supply chain and ship from outside the United States when selling to China. This fact shows that there is really no turning back from the export control path that the United States and its allies have gone down. Half measures incur nearly all of the costs of an aggressive export control policy—in terms of incentivizing U.S. firm outsourcing, foreign substitution, and Chinese indigenous investment—while delivering comparatively few of the strategic benefits. 10. There is no change in U.S. or allied policy that will persuade the Chinese government and Chinese firms to abandon their semiconductor equipment de-Americanization and decoupling efforts. However, the United States can take steps to make those efforts more difficult and to extract more strategic benefits in semiconductor and AI competition. Critics of export controls oftentimes make two related arguments. First, revenues from China can be reinvested in R&D and thus contribute to increased U.S. technological competitiveness, including against Chinese firms. Second, prohibiting exports increases willingness on the part of Chinese firms and the Chinese government to invest in competitors to U.S. firms, decreasing U.S. technological competitiveness. However, these arguments assume that the strategic approach of the Chinese government and Chinese firms depends solely or primarily upon U.S. actions, which is contradicted by the review of Chinese policy at the beginning of this paper and from the experience of the EV and solar industries. Consider a thought experiment: What would be the likely policy response of the Chinese government if the United States decided to begin unrestricted exports of nuclear submarines to China? U.S. nuclear submarines are widely regarded as the best in the world, and China’s spies have long devoted major efforts to stealing U.S. submarine technology secrets. Presumably, therefore, China would leap at the chance to buy U.S. nuclear submarines on the open market. And, under the logic of the above two arguments—increased U.S. revenue and decreased Chinese investment—these sales would increase, not decrease, the U.S. technological advantage in nuclear submarine technology. Are American policymakers fools for using export controls to block nuclear submarine sales to China? Of course not. Even if a hypothetical reckless U.S. president and Congress were to allow China to buy as many submarines as U.S. firms could make, China would never accept that this state of affairs is likely to continue on a permanent basis. China would obviously take the submarines they could get and reverse engineer the technology as fast as possible and transfer that technology to their domestic submarine industry, which they would continue to financially support. The increased revenue from R&D for U.S. firms is not going to make nearly as much of a difference as China’s hands-on opportunity to reverse engineer U.S. technology. Neither would the lost sales among Chinese submarine manufacturers decrease China’s commitment to supporting a domestic industry. This is not to even mention the grave risks to national security of a hypothetical Chinese navy equipped with U.S.-built nuclear submarines. This admittedly extreme thought experiment bears consideration because, while some in the West question whether semiconductor manufacturing equipment deserves to be viewed as a strategic technology of major importance to national security, China’s leaders do not. This belief is evident not only in words but also the deeds, whether that be Chinese state-backed espionage against equipment firms, aggressive reverse engineering of purchased Western equipment, or the astonishing amount of financial resources dedicated to indigenization. There is simply no policy that the United States could articulate that would persuade China to abandon its goals of de-Americanization and decoupling in the semiconductor equipment sector. As the United States and allied governments consider reforms to semiconductor equipment controls, they should focus less on how to change China’s goals and more on how to make achieving those goals as expensive and complicated as possible.

All Rights Reserved.","Photo : PonyWang via Getty Images Report by Gregory C. Allen Published November 26 , 2024 There is a fierce debate in the United States and among its allies about the impacts of export controls , and nowhere is that debate more heated than in the semiconductor equipment manufacturing industry . Too often , however , this debate occurs without any grounding in real-world data or relevant historical Chinese policy context . This paper seeks to provide some of that grounding through a combination of Chinese policy document analysis and new financial and market share data for leading semiconductor equipment firms in China , the United States , Japan , and the Netherlands . What follows are a set of 10 key judgments based on the author ’ s analysis . 1 . China ’ s ambitions for eliminating dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturing equipment started long before America ’ s expanded usage of technology export controls . The first and most important argument among critics of U.S. export controls is that they weaken U.S. technology leadership by incentivizing China to eliminate U.S. technology from its semiconductor supply chain . However , reducing dependence on foreign semiconductor and semiconductor manufacturing equipment suppliers was official Chinese policy before the Trump administration ’ s April 2018 export controls restricting sales of U.S.-designed chips to ZTE , a Chinese telecommunications firm , launched the new era of semiconductor export controls . “ The Roadmap of Major Technical Domains for Made in China 2025 , ” which was published in September 2015 and covered semiconductors and other sectors , included goals such as “ replacement of imports with Chinese-made products basically achieved in key industries ” by 2025 . It set specific targets and deadlines for the degree of market share that Chinese companies were supposed to reach and by what date . Targets for the semiconductor manufacturing equipment sector include the following : As the Made in China 2025 technical document roadmap stated , “ meeting domestic market demand , improving the self-sufficiency rate of integrated circuit products , meeting national security needs , and occupying the strategic product market have always been the greatest demand and driving force for the development of the integrated circuit industry. ” Even earlier policies , though less well resourced , sought to dramatically reduce use of foreign semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment . For example , the 2006 “ Medium Long Range Plan for the Development of Science and Technology ” explicitly called for self-sufficiency in semiconductor technologies and initiated so-called “ mega projects ” to drive toward that goal . For more than a decade , China ’ s government has provided lavish subsidies in the form of tax breaks , free land , government grants , and equity infusions to a number of Chinese semiconductor equipment companies . Naura , one of China ’ s leading domestic semiconductor manufacturing equipment companies received $ 1.3 billion in state support in 2021 , even before the imposition of the Biden administration ’ s export controls . AMEC , another leading Chinese semiconductor equipment company , received a similar equity investment from the “ Big Fund ” in 2015 . Simply put , China ’ s goal of semiconductor equipment industry localization and robust policy support predated any modern effort to impose meaningful export controls on China ’ s chip fabrication capabilities . 2 . There is not a simple relationship between export controls and China ’ s rate of technological progress . China ’ s greatest progress came in sectors with no export controls . A September 2024 analysis by Bernstein Research , an equity research firm , included a review of China ’ s semiconductor self-sufficiency goals from the 2015 roadmap and found that “ China has made impressive progress and likely will beat the ‘ Made in China 2025 ’ targets for integrated circuit ( IC ) Design and Manufacturing , but may miss the goals for IC equipment and Materials. ” As the Bernstein analysis shows , the rate of China ’ s progress toward self-sufficiency is best predicted by the market and technological complexities of each semiconductor market segment , not by the extent to which export controls were applied . It is certainly not the case that the segments in which China has made the most progress—or even devoted the most resources—are the areas in which the United States has applied export controls most forcefully . That there is not a simple relationship between export controls and China ’ s technological progress should be obvious given that China has made rapid progress in other technological domains—such as solar cells and electric vehicles ( EVs ) —where the United States applied no export controls and in some cases actively supported the rise of a Chinese supply chain . The United States applied no export controls in the case of the equipment used to manufacture silicon solar cells , yet today China dominates both production of solar cells and production of the equipment used to make them . This equipment is in many ways similar to ( though less sophisticated than ) the equipment used to make and process silicon wafers for semiconductors . In fact , one Chinese company , Naura , is a domestic leader in both manufacturing equipment for both solar cells and semiconductors . The biggest difference in Chinese outcomes between those two industries is not the presence or absence of export controls but the far greater technological complexity of producing semiconductor manufacturing equipment . The EV maker Tesla made a major push into Chinese manufacturing in late 2018 , launching deep partnerships with many local Chinese suppliers , such as battery-maker CATL . As a November 2024 commentary in a major Chinese state-run newspaper stated : `` Tesla ’ s rapid growth in sales , fueled by its technological and branding advantages and backed by China ’ s massive consumer market , has driven the rapid development of upstream and downstream supply chains . Today , the localization rate of parts for Tesla ’ s Shanghai Gigafactory exceeds 95 % , with more than 60 suppliers integrated into Tesla ’ s global supply chain . '' The Chinese EV supply chain , which Tesla helped dramatically increase in both scale and technological sophistication , is now also supplying Tesla ’ s competitors . Defections of Tesla-trained skilled employees are also a challenge . An April 2024 New York Times report claimed that most of Tesla ’ s early Chinese employees now work at competing Chinese firms . In a January Tesla earnings call , Tesla CEO Elon Musk said “ The Chinese car companies are the most competitive car companies in the world . . . . Frankly , I think if there are not trade barriers established , they will pretty much demolish most other companies in the world. ” The point here is not to suggest with unwarranted certainty that export controls would have definitively prevented China ’ s rise in the solar and EV industries . Rather , it is to caution the reader against relying too heavily on cursory anecdotal evidence to reach conclusions about when export controls do or do not work and what the counterfactual outcome would have been if export controls were or were not applied . Much depends upon the state of the global market landscape , the complexity of the controlled technology , the current technological sophistication of the targeted country , the design of the export control regulations , and the robustness of the controls ’ implementation and enforcement . Only a detailed analysis can hope to reach anything approaching insight . 3 . Semiconductor export controls—as implemented thus far—have in different ways and at different times both helped and hindered Chinese firms . Just as foreign firms have supported Chinese competitor growth in solar cells and EVs in the absence of export controls , so have they done in semiconductor manufacturing . The major semiconductor manufacturing equipment providers all have major service businesses , where , among other things , they train customer companies on how to get the most out of their equipment . Prior to the October 2022 changes in U.S. export controls , this could include assisting with the facility planning , installation , repairs , and operational troubleshooting of equipment as part of advanced chip manufacturing operations . Industry sources told CSIS that this sometimes included contract research and development ( R & D ) of advanced node semiconductor process technology on behalf of or in partnership with Chinese clients . At least as of November 2024 , this is still legal in the case of providing support to Chinese legacy chip manufacturing operations . By contrast , earlier U.S. export controls meaningfully reversed progress in some segments of the Chinese semiconductor sector , such as NAND memory manufacturing and smartphone chip design , though the durability of those setbacks , even if temporary , will depend on many factors . More recent export controls have also made life harder in many ways for Chinese semiconductor equipment firms , who can no longer legally obtain U.S. subcomponents or technical expertise . Thus , it is simply wrong to say that export controls always , in isolation , accelerate Chinese technological indigenization and that making it easier for U.S. firms to export will always slow Chinese indigenization . At the same time , it is unambiguously the case that the United States ’ use of semiconductor export controls , beginning with ZTE in April 2018 , made a massive impression on both political and corporate leaders in China . Speeches at the time by Chinese leadership , including General Secretary Xi Jinping , indicate that ZTE was viewed as a turning point and justified China ’ s aggressive pursuit of “ self-reliance ” in science and technology . Pony Ma , the chairman of Tencent , one of China ’ s largest technology firms , said in May 2018 , “ The recent ZTE incident made us see clearly that no matter how advanced our mobile payment is , without mobile devices , without microchips and operating systems , we can ’ t compete competently. ” The evidence goes beyond talk to specific actions . China made significant changes to its semiconductor policy in the years following ZTE , and China ’ s central government directed local governments to “ do everything in their power ” to promote the semiconductor sector . Some Chinese companies also took drastic measures to respond after ZTE . For example , Nikkei Asia reported that Yangtze Memory Technologies Corporation ( YMTC ) —one of China ’ s most advanced semiconductor manufacturers—began a full-blown de-Americanization campaign in 2019 involving the full-time work of more than 800 staff ( both YMTC and its suppliers ) . This included the establishment of multiple new major partnerships with domestic Chinese equipment producers . Of note , at the time when YMTC began this de-Americanization initiative , no significant U.S. export controls applied to the company . YMTC began their work based on fear of future controls , not the reality of current ones . Combined , this provides strong evidence that the export controls did increase the desire of both the Chinese government and Chinese companies to increase the capabilities of local semiconductor equipment providers , but that is not the same thing as saying that export controls caused accelerated indigenization , which depends upon more than just desire . 4 . The Biden administration ’ s 2022 export controls strengthened a policy approach to semiconductor equipment controls that began in 2019 during the first Trump administration . As with chip export controls , the first Trump administration launched the U.S. government ’ s modern approach to semiconductor manufacturing equipment export controls . According to reporting by Reuters , the U.S. government successfully persuaded the Dutch government in July 2019 to cancel the export license of EUV lithography equipment to SMIC , China ’ s most advanced logic chip foundry . In December 2020 , SMIC was added to the U.S. Department of Commerce ’ s Entity List , prohibiting the company from buying certain kinds of U.S. equipment , specifically , “ items uniquely required for production of semiconductors at advanced technology nodes ( 10 nanometers and below , including extreme ultraviolet technology ) . ” In October 2022 , the Biden administration significantly expanded U.S. export controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment , including not only Entity List and end-use restrictions but also some country-wide export controls that applied to China as a whole ( including a use of the U.S. persons rule ) . Just as importantly , the Biden administration made some of these controls more multilateral in nature , engaging Japan and the Netherlands to overhaul their export control policies for advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment . Even though these controls did not entirely align with U.S. controls , this was important to ensure that Dutch and Japanese companies did not provide China with alternative sources for the items that the United States was no longer willing to sell . 5 . Chinese semiconductor equipment firms started very small but have grown rapidly . However , this rapid growth occurred both before and after export controls and took place during a period of massive Chinese equipment demand growth . China ’ s domestic semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry has long been both small and technologically inferior to the global state of the art . To understand the growth trajectory of the Chinese semiconductor manufacturing equipment sector , CSIS gathered market data on how China ’ s global semiconductor manufacturing equipment market share has changed over time across both supply and demand ( see Table 1 ) . China has grown as both a supplier and as a buyer of semiconductor manufacturing equipment over the past 15 years . And while Chinese firms have in aggregate increased China ’ s share of global supply , they remain quite small in comparison to foreign firms , providing only 3.2 percent of the equipment ( by dollar value ) globally and 9.6 percent of the equipment purchased by customers operating in China in 2023 ( see Figure 1 ) . Some industry sources , such as the research firm Sanford Bernstein , estimate that the Chinese domestic market share captured by Chinese equipment providers ( aka Chinese self-sufficiency ) is 15 percent . Whether the true figure is closer to 9.6 percent or 15 percent , the equipment that Chinese firms sell remains almost exclusively confined to legacy nodes and remains far behind the global state of the art . However , industry sources have told CSIS that Chinese equipment has grown in competitiveness compared with the legacy node equipment sold by leading global suppliers . Until the Biden administration ’ s October 2022 export controls , it was generally legal to sell critical subcomponents or expert consulting services to Chinese equipment firms , assisting with their growth in both sales and technological knowhow . In addition to voluntary foreign support , Chinese firms have benefitted from industrial espionage that has included state-backed cyberattacks on equipment companies . Chinese equipment firms have also benefitted from hundreds of billions of dollars in government investments , tax credits , and subsidies . 6 . R & D expenditures by Chinese semiconductor firms have grown explosively , though the rate of growth has decreased somewhat since 2021 . Using public financial filings , CSIS has collected R & D expenditure data from the eight largest publicly traded Chinese semiconductor equipment firms ( see Figure 3 ) . As the above data shows , the Chinese semiconductor equipment industry started out with comparatively low R & D expenditure but has shown extraordinary growth since the beginning of the Made in China 2025 policy era in 2015 . Relative growth rates of R & D have slowed in the industry over the past two years , but growth in absolute terms remains very high . This data is not consistent with a simple story of “ export controls caused a boom in the Chinese semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry ” and instead shows that annual growth rates were very high both before and after the United States began imposing export controls . One plausible interpretation of the data is that U.S. and Dutch export controls in the 2018–2020 period increased desire among both the Chinese government and Chinese equipment customers in strengthening the local equipment industry , but they did so without making it more difficult for Chinese firms to obtain help—even from U.S. experts and equipment subcomponent providers . The export controls of 2022 and 2023 may have further increased interest among the Chinese government and customers , but such interest and ability to productively absorb additional investment was already nearly maxed out . However , the export controls of 2022 and 2023 also took extensive steps ( e.g. , extensive application of the Foreign Direct Product Rule and the U.S. persons rule , multilateralization of the controls ) to make it more difficult for Chinese firms to obtain foreign help in advancing the reliability and competitiveness of their technology . Thus , the pace of revenue and R & D expenditure growth among Chinese equipment providers slowed somewhat ( while remaining high in absolute terms ) . Again , this is a plausible interpretation that is consistent with the available data , but the available data is not sufficient in and of itself to definitively state that this is the correct interpretation . Another plausible interpretation for slowing pace of growth—discussed in the next section—is that Chinese customers for semiconductor manufacturing equipment dramatically accelerated equipment purchases in an effort to stockpile equipment in anticipation of future export controls and that this surge of foreign imports stockpiling temporarily reduced demand growth for domestic equipment ( while not changing China ’ s long-term commitment to end reliance on imports ) . There are some limitations in the R & D data , as not all of the companies are exclusively focused on the semiconductor equipment industry . Naura , for example , has lithium battery and photovoltaic business units which industry sources told CSIS are responsible for about 18 percent of the firm ’ s revenue ( and presumably comprised a comparable share of its R & D for at least some period ) , but these are not broken out in the firm ’ s public financial reporting . Additionally , there are important Chinese semiconductor equipment firms that are not included in this analysis , such as Shanghai Microelectronics Equipment ( SMEE ) and Huawei ’ s recently established semiconductor equipment subsidiaries , because they do report such data publicly . The absence of Huawei ’ s semiconductor equipment subsidiaries , in particular , could be an important missing source of data . Huawei ’ s private investment in R & D and the semiconductor equipment that it produces for its own secret network of chip manufacturers would not be captured in any of the data sources used in this report . In October 2023 , the Dutch newspaper NRC , citing anonymous ASML employees , reported that an employee who stole significant semiconductor manufacturing equipment technology secrets moved to China and now works for Huawei . This suggests that Huawei is making a significant investment in lithography equipment , as does a 2022 Huawei patent filed under the name “ Extreme Ultraviolet ( EUV ) Lithography. ” While these complications mean that the specific R & D values as presented have an error bar , the overall trajectory characterized is likely close to the reality of the Chinese semiconductor equipment industry as a whole . 7 . In the 2016–2024 period , leading U.S. and international semiconductor equipment firms continued to demonstrate strong Chinese revenue growth after imposition of increasingly strict export controls . The top three U.S. semiconductor manufacturing equipment providers are Applied Materials , Lam Research , and KLA Corporation . Together with ASML of the Netherlands and Tokyo Electron and Advantest of Japan , they comprise the six largest semiconductor equipment providers in the world by revenue . In their financial reports , these firms report the share of their revenue derived from China ( not including Taiwan ) . CSIS extracted and aggregated this data to show that these firms have grown revenue in China both before and after the United States began imposing export controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment . For the top three U.S. providers , Chinese revenue growth outperformed growth in the rest of the world every year in the 2016–2024E period . Similarly , ASML , the Dutch lithography equipment firm , also saw dramatic growth in sales of equipment to China that exceeded growth in the rest of the world . Finally , the same is true of Tokyo Electron and Advantest , the two leading Japanese equipment providers . Both saw superior performance in China compared with the rest of the world . The most likely explanation for this is that Chinese firms have shifted their purchases of international equipment earlier so that they occurred prior to expected future export controls ( which the U.S. government has maintained since 2022 will be updated annually ) . Just as Huawei built up a U.S. chip stockpile equivalent to multiple years of demand during a period prior to U.S. export control loopholes being closed , Chinese semiconductor manufacturers have acquired a stockpile of U.S. and other foreign equipment in anticipation of strengthened export controls coming in the near future . This “ pulling demand forward ” interpretation is the one that many executives in the semiconductor equipment industry have evidently reached . In July 2024 , both the CEO of ASML and the CEO of ASM said during investor earnings calls that Chinese semiconductor manufacturers would likely decrease purchases of equipment soon , as they have struggled to “ digest ” all of the accelerated purchases of equipment and spare parts that they have made , effectively confirming that many tools that have been sold to China are still likely awaiting installation and remain unused . Similarly , in August 2024 , a Lam Research executive likewise described “ inventory stocking ” behavior among Chinese customers over the past several years . 8 . Export controls changed the composition of equipment demand both technologically ( decreasing the technological sophistication of demand in China ) and geographically ( shifting more demand outside of China ) but likely did not change the overall demand trajectory . Decades before the Trump administration ’ s April 2018 export controls on ZTE ushered in the modern era of semiconductor export controls , the U.S. policy goal for exports of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China was already to restrict sales of advanced equipment to trusted U.S. allies and partners while allowing the sale of older , less advanced equipment to China . A 2002 U.S. government policy review of semiconductor technology exports to China stated this explicitly . Neither the Trump administration nor the Biden administration fundamentally changed this approach at a high level . Both administrations continued to allow the sale of legacy equipment , though they increased restrictions on sales of advanced equipment exports . In the case of the Biden administration , it also communicated an intent to end the “ sliding scale ” approach that allowed the sophistication of equipment exports to China to advance , but on a multiyear delay from the global state of the art . As such , China has continued to be a large and growing market for equipment exports even after the more recent export controls , but Chinese firms have changed their focus from a rush to compete at the most advanced semiconductor technological nodes to maximizing both domestic self-sufficiency and global leadership in legacy chip production . China was likely to pursue a massive expansion of chip production capacity regardless of U.S. actions , but the export controls helped ensure that this capacity did not drive the U.S. and allies toward a strategic dependence on China for the most technologically advanced chips , such as those that power AI systems or high-end smartphones . Moreover , the overall demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment fundamentally depends on the overall demand for manufactured chips . As the demand for advanced chips grows , that demand will translate into demand for advanced equipment . And if China is not in a position to purchase advanced equipment , then the purchase and production will instead take place outside of China . The chief financial officer of ASML , Roger Dassen , said this explicitly during ASML ’ s July 2024 earnings call with investment analysts : `` . . . the way we look at the demand for our tools is not from a specific geography . In this case , China . We look at—and that 's the way we model our sales medium term and long term . We look at what is the global demand for wafers and whether those wafers are being produced in country X or country Y , at the end of the day , it does n't matter . And I think that is very important to recognize in looking at your model . We do n't have a specific China element in our models . It is the global demand for wafers that drives our modeling . '' Accordingly , U.S. and allied controls did not so much destroy demand as change its composition . China is buying fewer advanced tools than it would have otherwise and is instead purchasing more legacy tools . The advanced tools that would have been sold to China have instead been sold to places like the United States , Taiwan , South Korea , Japan , and Europe . Likewise , given that many foreign players are wary of investing in legacy nodes due to fears of Chinese overcapacity , the tools are being largely sold to China for those production lines , not elsewhere . Chinese firms are also likely attempting to use many “ node-agnostic ” or “ backwards compatible ” equipment tools not subject to a control to bolster their advanced node efforts . 9 . Increased application of semiconductor equipment export controls coincided with and likely caused U.S. equipment firms to ensure that sales to China did not ship from the United States and/or were manufactured outside the United States . CSIS has produced an estimate of the Chinese semiconductor equipment revenue of each of the top three U.S. semiconductor equipment companies by taking their topline revenue from China and subtracting the share reported as services and non-semiconductor equipment businesses ( e.g. , display , printed circuit board inspection ) . This figure would include any semiconductor manufacturing equipment sales to China from these three firms shipped from any of their facilities worldwide , whether those facilities are in the United States or elsewhere . U.S. trade data provided by the International Trade Commission ( ITC ) reports the dollar value of all U.S. exports based on six-digit North American Industry Classification System ( NAICS ) codes . The NAICS Code for “ Semiconductor Machinery Manufacturing ” is 333242 , which covers all front-end semiconductor manufacturing equipment . CSIS collected ITC trade data for all U.S. exports of 333242 goods to China . This figure includes any semiconductor manufacturing equipment sales made from U.S. soil , whether those sales are made by U.S.-owned or internationally owned firms . In practice , the top three U.S. semiconductor manufacturing equipment companies—Applied Materials , Lam Research , and KLA Corporation—tend to dominate 333242 exports to nearly all countries . Based on these two datasets , one could see that U.S. equipment sales to China by U.S. firms have increasingly become exported from non-U.S. countries since 2016 and especially after 2019 ( see Figure 7 ) . From 2016 to 2020 , the ratio of sales to exports grew 34 percent , from 1.1 to 1.5 . However , from 2021 to 2024 , the ratio nearly doubled , from 1.6 to 3.1 . In other words , exports to China and sales to China used to be nearly identical , but sales overwhelmingly outgrew exports in the post-2020 period , the same period when the United States adopted significantly stricter export controls . Industry sources told CSIS that much of the change was originally due to U.S. firms seeking to legally avoid export controls that—in the absence of strict usage of the Foreign Direct Product Rule—only applied to exports from U.S. soil . This interpretation is consistent with the remarks of KLA CEO Rick Wallace , who discussed how some versions of U.S. semiconductor equipment export controls did not apply to U.S. companies manufacturing their equipment abroad and shipping from abroad during the company ’ s 2020 Q3 earnings call . The exchange is important and worth quoting at length : `` Question : Regarding the Department of Commerce ruling , and I know it 's still very early , and I 'm sure you 're awaiting clarity on how broader now the rules will be pursued . But if you think about what 's been written to date , the major ruling is for manufacturing in the U.S. and considering you do make tools and assemble tools offshore , is your first interpretation that you will not be impacted in terms of shipping into China based on kind of what you read today ? Rick Wallace : Our understanding at this point is , this will impact the tools that are manufactured in the U.S. , which are manufactured for us in California . We have three major manufacturing sites ; Israel , Singapore and here . So there is a potential impact depending on the customer . And our final understanding of the ruling that [ is that it ] will impact tools that come out of California . '' In short , export controls that do not include strict implementation and enforcement of the Foreign Direct Product Rule or U.S. persons rule can incentivize U.S. firms to move production offshore , costing the United States manufacturing jobs . In recent years , U.S. semiconductor manufacturing equipment firms have doubled-down and expanded their non-U.S. manufacturing operations . Both KLA Corporation and Applied Materials have committed to major expansions of their Singapore manufacturing facilities , while LAM Research has built out its largest manufacturing site in Malaysia . In quantitative terms , this is one of the most striking effects of the export controls as implemented thus far , and it clearly illustrates the risk that countries take by applying export controls that do not apply extraterritorially in industries where off-shoring some or all production is relatively easy . As one Japanese business executive stated , his company will “ develop duplicate supply chains—one for the U.S.-led economic bloc and one for [ the ] China-led bloc. ” Industry sources told CSIS that , more recently , both U.S. and international semiconductor equipment companies are being required by their Chinese customers to remove all U.S. citizens from their supply chain and ship from outside the United States when selling to China . This fact shows that there is really no turning back from the export control path that the United States and its allies have gone down . Half measures incur nearly all of the costs of an aggressive export control policy—in terms of incentivizing U.S. firm outsourcing , foreign substitution , and Chinese indigenous investment—while delivering comparatively few of the strategic benefits . 10 . There is no change in U.S. or allied policy that will persuade the Chinese government and Chinese firms to abandon their semiconductor equipment de-Americanization and decoupling efforts . However , the United States can take steps to make those efforts more difficult and to extract more strategic benefits in semiconductor and AI competition . Critics of export controls oftentimes make two related arguments . First , revenues from China can be reinvested in R & D and thus contribute to increased U.S. technological competitiveness , including against Chinese firms . Second , prohibiting exports increases willingness on the part of Chinese firms and the Chinese government to invest in competitors to U.S. firms , decreasing U.S. technological competitiveness . However , these arguments assume that the strategic approach of the Chinese government and Chinese firms depends solely or primarily upon U.S. actions , which is contradicted by the review of Chinese policy at the beginning of this paper and from the experience of the EV and solar industries . Consider a thought experiment : What would be the likely policy response of the Chinese government if the United States decided to begin unrestricted exports of nuclear submarines to China ? U.S. nuclear submarines are widely regarded as the best in the world , and China ’ s spies have long devoted major efforts to stealing U.S. submarine technology secrets . Presumably , therefore , China would leap at the chance to buy U.S. nuclear submarines on the open market . And , under the logic of the above two arguments—increased U.S. revenue and decreased Chinese investment—these sales would increase , not decrease , the U.S. technological advantage in nuclear submarine technology . Are American policymakers fools for using export controls to block nuclear submarine sales to China ? Of course not . Even if a hypothetical reckless U.S. president and Congress were to allow China to buy as many submarines as U.S. firms could make , China would never accept that this state of affairs is likely to continue on a permanent basis . China would obviously take the submarines they could get and reverse engineer the technology as fast as possible and transfer that technology to their domestic submarine industry , which they would continue to financially support . The increased revenue from R & D for U.S. firms is not going to make nearly as much of a difference as China ’ s hands-on opportunity to reverse engineer U.S. technology . Neither would the lost sales among Chinese submarine manufacturers decrease China ’ s commitment to supporting a domestic industry . This is not to even mention the grave risks to national security of a hypothetical Chinese navy equipped with U.S.-built nuclear submarines . This admittedly extreme thought experiment bears consideration because , while some in the West question whether semiconductor manufacturing equipment deserves to be viewed as a strategic technology of major importance to national security , China ’ s leaders do not . This belief is evident not only in words but also the deeds , whether that be Chinese state-backed espionage against equipment firms , aggressive reverse engineering of purchased Western equipment , or the astonishing amount of financial resources dedicated to indigenization . There is simply no policy that the United States could articulate that would persuade China to abandon its goals of de-Americanization and decoupling in the semiconductor equipment sector . As the United States and allied governments consider reforms to semiconductor equipment controls , they should focus less on how to change China ’ s goals and more on how to make achieving those goals as expensive and complicated as possible .

US,itif.org,news,"May 5, 2025",Overly Stringent Export Controls Chip Away at American AI Leadership,"The Biden administration’s export control policy for AI chips has largely been a failure since day one. Yet, year after year, it has doubled down, attempting to plug various loopholes. The policy has now expanded to an almost comical extent—but the consequences are no joke. While the U.S. government is right to prevent U.S. companies from selling advanced AI technology to the Chinese military, cutting U.S. companies off from the entire Chinese market is a cure worse than the disease. It will ultimately harm both U.S. national security and economic interests. The Biden administration issued its first AI chip export controls in October 2022, restricting the export of AI chips to China, as well as the technology to manufacture those chips. Since then, it has expanded those restrictions to cover additional countries, less-advanced chips, and related hardware components (e.g., high-bandwidth memory). The most recent set of restrictions , introduced in January 2025, imposes a three-tiered system for access to advanced AI hardware and models. Under this latest framework—scheduled to go into effect on May 15 unless altered by the Trump administration—120 countries, including close allies such as Israel, India, and Singapore, face a cap on the number of advanced chips they can receive. But instead of limiting China’s access to advanced AI, these sweeping restrictions risk isolating U.S. firms from the global market and creating openings for Chinese competitors to step in. Most recently, the Trump administration has extended the export controls to Nvidia’s H20 chip . Nvidia specifically designed the H20 to comply with U.S. export controls. In terms of specifications, it is comparable to the H100 chip, a popular graphics processing unit (GPU) chip Nvidia released in 2022, but the H20 is more energy efficient and has slightly more memory. However, the H20 is significantly less advanced than Nvidia’s newest line of chips, the B100 and B200, and it has less memory than the H200. The U.S. government is right to want to keep advanced AI chips out of China’s military systems. But effectively banning Nvidia from exporting chips like the H20—as noted, designed to meet U.S. export requirements—goes too far. Nvidia has already reported a $5.5 billion financial hit from the new restrictions. Blocking access weakens U.S. competitiveness and accelerates China’s efforts to build a self-sufficient chip industry. The United States will not achieve AI dominance if its firms cannot access global markets. U.S. markets alone are simply not large enough to support globally competitive high-tech firms, which must have access to global markets of scale to earn sufficient revenues needed to reinvest in the expensive effort of bringing next-generation products to market. U.S. export controls have accelerated China’s efforts to close the gap. In 2019, Huawei’s Ascend 910 chip was manufactured by TSMC in Taiwan. Following U.S. restrictions, Huawei moved production to mainland China. It took two years, but by 2022, it was producing the 910B chip , a slight improvement over the original. Now, Huawei has announced that the Ascend 910c , the next version of this chip, will be released as early as May 2025, and it continues development of its next-generation Ascend 910d chip. Analysts expect these chips to perform on par with the Nvidia H100, but at 60-70 percent of the cost . Huawei isn’t the only player that is helping China close the gap. China has firms innovating and competing across all layers of the chip ecosystem. Companies such as Biren Technology, MetaX, and Enflame are designing AI chips. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) competes with TSMC for fabrication and is reportedly nearing the ability to produce 5nm chips (an improvement over its current 7nm, though still well behind TSMC’s 2nm ). China’s Yangtze Memory Technology Corporation (YMTC) has produced high-density memory chips comparable to those produced by its Korean rivals, despite U.S. export restrictions. Moreover, China is innovating in how to deploy less efficient chips more effectively. Earlier this year, a Chinese research team won an award at a prestigious international conference, doing just that— using less powerful chips to outperform high-end hardware . And as DeepSeek showed when it released its highly capable AI model at a fraction of the cost of its rivals , China does not have to make the best chips if it can make the most affordable ones. It’s also important to recognize that China’s goal is to develop high-tech products—from mobile phones to AI and legacy chips to foundry capabilities—that are good enough to replace foreign imports with domestically produced Chinese goods. Indeed, China has been quite unequivocal that it seeks to achieve at least 70 percent self-sufficiency in the semiconductor industry by the end of the decade. Overall, China likely remains a few years behind U.S. chipmakers—although Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently stated, “China is right behind us. We're very, very close.” But it continues to make progress, and Chinese firms enjoy full support from their government. Last year, the Chinese government created a 344 billion yuan ($47.5 billion) investment fund to support its semiconductor industry, following similar investments in 2019 (204 billion yuan) and 2014 (139 billion yuan). In fact, if one adds up semiconductor-sector investments made by Chinese governments at all levels (national, provincial, city), Tufts University’s Chris Miller has suggested that China “has probably invested the equivalent of [America’s] CHIPS Act virtually every year since 2014.” Uncertainty and rapid policy shifts don’t just target China—they undermine American firms that follow the rules, limit their ability to compete globally, and push international customers toward Chinese suppliers. U.S. companies such as Nvidia are being penalized for designing products that comply with the rules, only to have the rules changed after the fact. This not only damages American economic interests but also erodes trust in U.S. trade policy. Worse still, the current approach is counterproductive. By cutting off U.S. firms from international markets, the United States is effectively accelerating China’s progress in AI chips. Chinese companies now have a stronger incentive—and greater market opportunity—to replace U.S. suppliers, spurring domestic innovation and attracting buyers who can no longer rely on American technology. Rather than slowing China's ascent, the U.S. government is hastening it. Export controls should be precise and strategic, not sweeping and shortsighted. In that regard, one area where the Biden administration deserves credit—and which the Trump administration should preserve—is aligning key allies, notably Japan and the Netherlands, to restrict export of the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME), especially extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, to Chinese entities. While China may innovate around some of these barriers over time, these tools remain a significant chokepoint in the near term. Leveraging allied coordination in this area is a far more effective way to slow China’s AI and semiconductor progress than blanket restrictions on chip exports. They can, at a stroke, slow the development of China’s broader semiconductor and AI ecosystems. It’s much easier to control the fishing rod than the fish. However, this strategy comes with trade-offs. Limiting SME exports imposes real costs on U.S. and allied toolmakers, underscoring the need to expand trusted markets. Policymakers should prioritize deepening information and communications technology production ecosystems and digital economies of allied nations so Western tech companies can grow their footprints in friendly countries. This is one reason why the January 2025 restrictions on AI chips were so ill-conceived. At stake is the opportunity to reshape the global economic playing field in favor of allied interests—building a world in which, a decade from now, U.S. tech companies are far less reliant on China because so much more of the world’s digital infrastructure is rooted in trusted markets across Africa, Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Americas. If the United States wants to maintain long-term leadership in AI and semiconductors, it should establish a clear and sustainable policy that protects national security without stifling innovation or isolating U.S. companies from the global economy. This effort cannot be a U.S.-only endeavor; it should engage and deliver benefits for allies as well. Without such a course correction, the United States risks not only undermining its own technological edge for years to come—but boosting China’s in the process.

US,itif.org,news,2022/10/13,Decoupling Risks: How Semiconductor Export Controls Could Harm US Chipmakers and Innovation,"U.S. export controls on semiconductor sales to China reduce U.S. chipmakers’ revenues, lower their R&D investment capabilities, and reduce industry employment. As such, U.S. policymakers should keep semiconductor export controls to a minimum. Contents Key Takeaways 1 Introduction . 3 Modeling the Economic Impact of Semiconductor Export Controls 4 Impact of Export Controls on U.S. Semiconductor Firms 6 Medium-Term Foregone Growth and Resulting Market 10 Long-Term Foregone Growth and Resulting Market 14 Impact on ICT Industries 17 Conclusion . 19 Appendix: Methodology 20 Endnotes 25 Semiconductors constitute the foundation of the global digital economy, generating $631 billion in global sales in 2024, and is projected to exceed $1 trillion by 2030, while enabling more than $7 trillion in annual downstream economic activity in fields such as artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and advanced manufacturing. [1] This represents roughly 7 percent of the world’s economic activity. [2] This report examines a hypothetical scenario in which the United States implements broader export controls and policies that effectively decouple U.S. semiconductor firms from the Chinese market. In reality, the United States has only implemented a limited set of export controls aimed at slowing China’s access to advanced semiconductors and related technologies for military and high-performance computing applications. For example, in October 2022, the Biden administration issued export controls restricting the sale of AI chips to China, along with technology to manufacture those chips. [3] Following that, in January 2025, the Department of Commerce announced a proposed AI diffusion rule that implemented a three-tiered system for access to advanced AI hardware, capping the number of advanced chips that foreign nations could receive. [4] However, those proposed rules were rescinded by the Trump administration. [5] On the other hand, the Chinese government could also impose similar restrictions on U.S. firms, resulting in a lost of access to the Chinese market. Indeed, because the Chinese government banned Micron products in critical infrastructure in 2023, the U.S. chip company intends to stop supplying server chips to China altogether. [6] Even within this limited framework, restrictions carry potential risks. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation’s (ITIF’s) economic model shows that reducing access to Chinese commercial markets in a decoupling scenario would reduce revenue for U.S. chipmakers, which in turn could lower investment in research and development (R&D), the primary driver of next-generation chips and long-term competitiveness in the industry. Slower revenue growth and innovation would not only weaken the global position of U.S. firms, but could also ripple across the broader economy by affecting high-skill jobs in semiconductor design and manufacturing and downstream employment in industries reliant on chips. In short, reduced revenues and fewer jobs would only end up harming American chip firms and American workers. This report develops an economic model to estimate the impact of U.S. semiconductor export controls if they were to lead to a full decoupling from the Chinese market. It provides the logic of the economic model followed by a summary of the semiconductor industry in 2024, which serve as the baseline for the model. Subsequently, the report estimates the initial impact of full decoupling on U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenues and R&D investments, before examining the impact on industry jobs and downstream jobs in the U.S. economy. In addition, the report estimates the market share and foregone revenue, as well as R&D investments and job losses, in both the short term and long term, assuming a full decoupling scenario. It then provides summaries of the impact from other scenarios of decoupling, such as 25 percent decoupling. The report concludes by exploring the impact of decoupling on specific information and communications technology (ICT) industry sectors. ITIF developed an economic model to estimate the impact of U.S. semiconductor export controls on China. This model estimates U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue, R&D investments, and jobs impact from four export control/decoupling scenarios: 1) full decoupling or export ban (U.S. companies are completely prohibited from selling to China); 2) 50 percent decoupling (U.S. semiconductors restricted selling to China, leading to a 50 percent revenue loss from the Chinese market); 3) 25 percent decoupling (some U.S. semiconductors cannot be sold to China, leading to a 25 percent revenue loss from the Chinese market); and 4) Entity List-based decoupling (U.S. companies cannot sell to a list of specific Chinese companies, leading to a 10 percent revenue loss from the Chinese market). (See the appendix for the full methodology.) The rationale behind the four decoupling scenarios is as follows. The United States will try to place export controls on the most important semiconductor products first before expanding the list. As such, the Entity List will first cut off some Chinese companies from a few key semiconductor products, leading U.S. firms to lose 10 percent of revenue from the Chinese market. However, gradually, the United States will expand export controls to encompass all semiconductor products, leading to a full decoupling between the two nations. This would mean that U.S. semiconductor firms would lose all their revenue from the Chinese market. The economic model measures the extent of negative impact U.S. export controls could have on U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue and share of the global industry. Assuming that the United States does not utilize the Foreign Direct Product Rule, U.S. firms’ losses could be gained by other nations, including China, the EU, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and others. Using the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and the Semiconductor Industry Association’s (SIA’s) “Emerging Resilience in the Semiconductor Supply Chain” report, ITIF estimated the global market shares of each nation for each semiconductor product in 2022. [7] (See figure 1.) Figure 1: Global market share of each semiconductor product type [8] Using this as a proxy for future global shares by nation, ITIF estimated the extent to which other nations could benefit from the lost U.S. revenue by removing the United States and scaling the remaining nations’ shares. As a result of U.S. firms’ revenue losses, their investment in R&D would also be reduced. As SIA found, U.S. semiconductor companies invested 17.7 percent of their revenue into R&D in 2024. [9] Every job in the semiconductor industry supports an additional 5.7 downstream jobs in the U.S. economy. Furthermore, the revenue losses would also mean that U.S. semiconductor companies may be unable to offer as many jobs, leading to a decline in the industry’s employment numbers. This decline would subsequently result in fewer downstream jobs being created in the U.S. economy. Indeed, as SIA found, every job in the semiconductor industry supports an additional 5.7 downstream jobs in the U.S. economy . [10] In sum, revenue losses would result in fewer jobs, reduced R&D investment, and a lower global market share for U.S. chipmakers. Figure 2 illustrates the analytical framework ITIF’s model uses to estimate the economic impact of U.S. semiconductor export controls on U.S. semiconductor firms and the U.S. economy. Figure 2: ITIF’s analytical framework for modeling the effects of U.S. semiconductor export controls on China The following sections provide background information on the global semiconductor market, the U.S. semiconductor market, China’s semiconductor market, and U.S. semiconductor firms’ share of the Chinese market in 2024. Afterward, they examine the initial impact of a full decoupling with China on U.S. firms’ revenue and other nations’ firms’ revenue. In addition, the section provides a summary of the impact of the three other decoupling scenarios: 50 percent decoupling, 25 percent decoupling, and Entity List-based export controls. The report later examines the extent to which each decoupling scenario would impact U.S. semiconductor firms’ R&D investment levels, before turning to the impact on jobs. In 2024, the global semiconductor industry generated $630.5 billion in revenue, of which U.S. semiconductor firms accounted for 50.4 percent. [11] Meanwhile, Chinese semiconductor firms accounted for 4.5 percent, or $28.4 billion. [12] China demands more chips than it produces. In 2024, China demanded 24 percent, or $151.3 billion, of the global semiconductor market. [13] Given U.S. semiconductor firms’ large market share, they supplied 50.7 percent of China’s demand in 2024. [14] (See table 1.) Table 1: Semiconductor market measures, 2024 [15] Measure Value (Billions) Share Global semiconductor market $631 100.0% Chinese firms’ global market share $28 4.5% China’s demand of global market $151 24.0% U.S. firms’ global market share $318 50.4% U.S. firms’ share of China market $77 50.7% China’s demand for semiconductors varies by type. For example, China’s computing and information technology (IT) industries may require logic chips such as central processing units, while a phone maker would need more memory chips and an electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer more sensors and microcontrollers. As such, using the SIA 2025 Factbook’s share of global demand for each semiconductor product type as a proxy, ITIF estimated China’s demand for each product type in 2024. [16] The top three semiconductor product types most demanded include logic chips (34 percent), memory chips (26 percent), and analog chips (13 percent). (See figure 3.) Figure 3: China’s chip demand by semiconductor product types [17] Since U.S. firms fulfill a significant share of China’s demand, export controls or full decoupling could have a severe impact on U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenues. They would eliminate, or at least partially reduce, U.S. firms’ ability to sell to China, thereby reducing U.S. firms’ overall revenue. In this section, ITIF uses 2024 as a baseline to estimate the revenue U.S. firms could lose and other nations’ firms could gain in the initial year after decoupling with China. Table 3 shows the potential revenue losses of U.S. firms by semiconductor product type after a full decoupling from China and the nations that could gain from U.S. firms’ losses. In the event of a complete decoupling, U.S. firms would no longer sell to China, meaning they would lose 100 percent of their revenue from China. In this scenario, U.S. firms could lose about $77 billion from complete decoupling with China. Meanwhile, mainland Chinese firms could gain about $9 billion, EU firms $15 billion, Japanese firms $12 billion, Taiwanese firms $14 billion, South Korean firms $21 billion, and other nations’ firms $5 billion of those losses. Table 2: Foreign firms’ potential gains from U.S. semiconductor firms’ losses after full decoupling (billions) [18] Product Type United States Mainland China Japan Taiwan EU South Korea Others Logic -$26.3 $3.8 $3.0 $8.3 $6.8 $2.3 $2.3 Memory -$20.1 $0.8 $1.9 $1.1 $0.1 $16.1 $0.1 Analog -$9.7 $1.5 $3.0 $0.8 $2.8 $0.7 $1.0 MPU -$6.6 $0.9 $0.8 $2.1 $1.7 $0.6 $0.6 Opto -$5.0 $0.8 $1.5 $0.4 $1.4 $0.3 $0.5 Discretes -$3.8 $0.6 $1.2 $0.3 $1.1 $0.3 $0.4 MCU -$2.7 $0.4 $0.3 $0.8 $0.7 $0.2 $0.2 Sensor -$2.3 $0.4 $0.7 $0.2 $0.7 $0.2 $0.2 DSP -$0.3 $0.0 $0.0 $0.1 $0.1 $0.0 $0.0 Total -$76.7 $9.1 $12.3 $14.1 $15.3 $20.6 $5.3 Any form of decoupling could exert negative impacts on U.S. firms’ revenues while benefitting other nations. U.S. firms could lose as much as $38.4 billion in revenue in the face of 50 percent decoupling with China. Of this, mainland Chinese firms could gain about $5 billion, South Korean firms $10 billion, and Taiwanese firms $7 billion. Under 25 percent decoupling, U.S. firms could lose about $19 billion while mainland Chinese firms could gain about $2 billion, Japanese ones $3 billion, and Taiwanese firms $4 billion. Lastly, under an Entity Listing against Chinese companies, U.S. firms could lose about $8 billion while mainland Chinese firms gain $1 billion, the EU’s firms $2 billion, and South Korea’s firms $2 billion. (See table 3.) Table 3: Foreign semiconductor firms’ potential gains from U.S. firms’ losses (billions) [19] Decoupling Scenarios United States Mainland China Japan Taiwan EU South Korea Others Full decoupling -$76.7 $9.1 $12.3 $14.1 $15.3 $20.6 $5.3 50% decoupling -$38.4 $4.5 $6.2 $7.0 $7.7 $10.3 $2.7 25% decoupling -$19.2 $2.3 $3.1 $3.5 $3.8 $5.1 $1.3 Entity List -$7.7 $0.9 $1.2 $1.4 $1.5 $2.1 $0.5 The U.S. semiconductor industry invests a significant share of its revenue in R&D to develop the next generation of globally competitive chips. In 2024 alone, the industry invested 17.7 percent of its revenue in R&D, and, on average, invested 18.3 percent from 2015 to 2024. As such, given that U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenues would decline from decoupling with China, R&D investments would also decline. Generally, the share of revenue invested in R&D would also decline when revenue declines, but ITIF kept the share constant for a more conservative estimate. The U.S. semiconductor industry invested $56.2 billion in R&D in 2024. However, if the United States fully decouples from China, U.S. firms’ R&D investments could decrease to about $43 billion, roughly $14 billion lower than the status quo. This is calculated by multiplying the industry’s R&D intensity by the lost revenues from precluded sales to China. Meanwhile, U.S. firms would likely reduce R&D investments to about $49 billion, or about $7 billion lower than the status quo, under 50 percent decoupling. Further, U.S. firms could reduce R&D investments to about $53 billion (about $3 billion lower than status quo) and $55 billion (about $1 billion lower) from 25 percent decoupling or export control entity listing, respectively. (See figure 4.) Figure 4: U.S. semiconductor firms’ future investments in R&D, by decoupling scenario [20] The robust U.S. semiconductor industry provides hundreds of thousands of jobs to the U.S. economy while simultaneously supporting downstream job creation in other sectors. For instance, a semiconductor process engineer position is one job in the economy, but it also indirectly supports logistics providers who ship the chips the engineer helps produce. Moreover, when the engineer spends their money in the economy, this further supports other jobs. For example, engineers support restaurant employees when they spend money at a restaurant. Indeed, as SIA’s 2025 Factbook highlights, a semiconductor industry job supports 5.7 additional downstream jobs in the U.S. economy. In 2024, the U.S. semiconductor industry supported approximately 345,000 direct jobs and indirectly supported nearly 2 million additional ones. However, when U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenues decline, they can no longer support as many industry jobs, leading to both direct and indirect job losses. Indeed, the U.S. semiconductor industry could support over 80,000 fewer industry jobs and almost 500,000 fewer downstream jobs if the United States fully decoupled from China. Meanwhile, the U.S. industry could support over 40,000 fewer industry jobs and more than 200,000 fewer downstream jobs in a scenario of 50 percent decoupling. A 25 percent decoupling could lead to about 20,000 fewer industry jobs and over 100,000 fewer downstream jobs. Finally, an export control entity listing could lead to over 8,000 fewer industry jobs and almost 50,000 fewer downstream jobs. (See figure 5.) In sum, significant export controls or decoupling with China could negatively impact U.S. households from decreased employment opportunities in well-paying high-tech jobs. Figure 5: U.S. semiconductor and additional job losses by decoupling scenario [21] The following section first examines the U.S. and Chinese global semiconductor market shares and revenues five years after a one-time full decoupling scenario. Afterward, it quantifies how a one-time full decoupling would negatively impact R&D investments in subsequent years, before examining the foregone jobs. If normal growth trajectories had prevailed (e.g., expected growth of China’s semiconductor market and stable U.S. market share) then after five years under a normal scenario, U.S. semiconductor companies could have been expected to earn about $84 billion from China’s market. With those revenues now lost in this full decoupling scenario, the sales would likely be accrued by other nations’ semiconductor firms. Chinese firms could gain about $10 billion, EU firms $17 billion, South Korean firms $22 billion, Japanese firms $13 billion, Taiwanese firms $15 billion, and other nations’ firms $6 billion. (See table 4.) Table 4: Foreign firms’ potential gains from U.S. firms’ losses five years after full decoupling (billions) [22] Product Type United States Mainland China Japan Taiwan EU South Korea Others Logic -$28.6 $4.1 $3.3 $9.0 $7.4 $2.5 $2.5 Memory -$21.9 $0.9 $2.0 $1.2 $0.1 $17.5 $0.1 Analog -$10.6 $1.6 $3.2 $0.9 $3.0 $0.7 $1.1 MPU -$7.2 $1.0 $0.8 $2.3 $1.8 $0.6 $0.6 Opto -$5.4 $0.8 $1.7 $0.5 $1.6 $0.4 $0.6 Discretes -$4.1 $0.6 $1.3 $0.3 $1.2 $0.3 $0.4 MCU -$2.9 $0.4 $0.3 $0.9 $0.7 $0.2 $0.2 Sensor -$2.5 $0.4 $0.8 $0.2 $0.7 $0.2 $0.3 DSP -$0.4 $0.1 $0.0 $0.1 $0.1 $0.0 $0.0 Total -$83.6 $9.9 $13.4 $15.4 $16.7 $22.4 $5.8 As a result of the revenue reduction, U.S. firms’ global market share would be lower than without decoupling after five years. Without decoupling, the U.S. semiconductor industry’s global revenue could be about $396 billion, or a market share of 48 percent. In comparison, with full decoupling, the U.S. industry’s market share would likely fall to about 38 percent, equating to about $313 billion in revenue. (See figure 6.) Figure 6: U.S. semiconductor firms’ global market share five years after full decoupling versus the status quo [23] In contrast, Chinese semiconductor firms could gain some of U.S. firms’ lost revenue and grow their overall global revenue and market share. Without decoupling, Chinese firms’ global revenue could be about $52 billion, or about 6.3 percent. However, with full decoupling, Chinese firms’ global revenue could grow to about $62 billion (about 7 percent) after five years, approximately $10 billion higher than without decoupling. (See figure 7.) Figure 7: Chinese semiconductor firms’ global market share five years after full decoupling [24] Due to the lower-than-expected revenue, U.S. firms’ R&D investments after five years would be smaller than with no decoupling. Without decoupling, U.S. firms would likely invest about $72 billion in R&D investments. Yet, U.S. firms could reduce their investments to about $57 billion under full decoupling, leading to $15 billion in foregone R&D investments. (See figure 8.) Figure 8: U.S. semiconductor firms’ investment in R&D five years after full decoupling versus the status quo [25] U.S. semiconductor firms’ lower-than-expected revenue also means that they would be able to support fewer industry and downstream jobs in the economy. Under the status quo scenario, the U.S. semiconductor industry could support about 400,000 industry jobs and 2.3 million downstream jobs. However, under full decoupling, U.S. firms could only support about 300,000 industry jobs and 1.8 million downstream jobs, leading to almost 100,000 foregone industry jobs and over 550,000 foregone downstream jobs. (See figure 9.) Figure 9: U.S. semiconductor and related jobs five years after full decoupling versus the status quo [26] In the medium term, U.S. firms would continue to forego revenue, R&D investments, and jobs in the event of any of the contemplated decoupling scenarios. Under 50 percent decoupling, U.S. firms could forego about $42 billion in revenue—resulting in a global market share of about 43 percent compared with 48 percent under the status quo—about $8 billion in R&D investments, about 50,000 industry jobs, and almost 300,000 downstream jobs after five years. Chinese firms could gain some of the U.S. firms’ losses, resulting in about a 7 percent global market share rather than 6 percent under the status quo. Under a 25 percent decoupling, U.S. firms would forego about $21 billion in revenue, $4 billion in R&D investments, almost 25,000 industry jobs and about 140,000 downstream jobs. U.S. firms’ global market share could fall to about 45 percent, while Chinese firms’ share could rise to about 7 percent. Under an Entity List scenario, U.S. firms could still forego about $8 billion in revenue, $2 billion in R&D, almost 10,000 industry jobs, and over 56,000 downstream jobs—U.S. firms’ global market share could fall to 47 percent while Chinese firms’ share could rise to 6 percent. (See table 5.)

Then, it examines the impact on U.S. semiconductor firms’ share of and revenue from the Chinese market, U.S. firms’ R&D investments, and U.S. industry and downstream jobs. Over the long run, the missing supply of semiconductors otherwise provided by U.S. firms to the Chinese market would be gained by foreign competitors, especially by China’s domestic semiconductor industry. As a result, these countries’ firms would have larger revenues to reinvest in R&D, accelerating their innovation capacity. Moreover, Chinese and other nations’ firms could steadily close the technological gap with the United States. In contrast, U.S. firms, constrained by smaller markets and diminished R&D capacity, could risk falling behind. This erosion of leadership could undermine the U.S. semiconductor industry’s central role in sustaining national competitiveness and technological primacy. ITIF estimates that, if current growth trends had prevailed and there had been no decoupling, U.S. semiconductor companies could have likely earned about $91 billion in revenues from the Chinese market 10 years from now. Again, those revenues are lost in this full decoupling scenario and instead would be accrued by firms from other nations. Here, ITIF estimates that South Korean firms could gain about $24 billion, EU firms $18 billion, and mainland Chinese firms $11 billion. Japan, Taiwan, and other nations could gain the remainder of the foregone revenue. (See table 6.) Table 6: Other nations’ gains and U.S. semiconductor firms’ foregone revenue by semiconductor product type 10 years after full decoupling (billions) [28] Product Type United States Japan Taiwan EU South Korea Mainland China Others Logic -$31.2 $3.6 $9.8 $8.0 $2.7 $4.5 $2.7 Memory -$23.9 $2.2 $1.3 $0.2 $19.1 $1.0 $0.2 Analog -$11.5 $3.5 $1.0 $3.3 $0.8 $1.8 $1.2 MPU -$7.8 $0.9 $2.5 $2.0 $0.7 $1.1 $0.7 Opto -$5.9 $1.8 $0.5 $1.7 $0.4 $0.9 $0.6 Discretes -$4.5 $1.4 $0.4 $1.3 $0.3 $0.7 $0.5 MCU -$3.1 $0.4 $1.0 $0.8 $0.3 $0.4 $0.3 Sensor -$2.7 $0.8 $0.2 $0.8 $0.2 $0.4 $0.3 DSP -$0.4 $0.0 $0.1 $0.1 $0.0 $0.1 $0.0 Total -$91.1 $14.6 $16.7 $18.2 $24.4 $10.8 $6.3 Under the status quo, U.S. firms could maintain their global market share of 48 percent, which would result in about $520 billion in global revenues 10 years on. In contrast, under full decoupling, U.S. firms’ market share would likely drop to about 40 percent, resulting in about $429 billion of global revenue. (See figure 10.) Figure 10: U.S. semiconductor firms’ global market share 10 years after full decoupling versus the status quo [29] In comparison, Chinese semiconductor firms’ global market share and revenue would be higher than no decoupling, as they would gain some of the U.S. firms’ lost revenue. Without decoupling, Chinese firms’ share could be about 6 percent, equating to a revenue of about $68 billion. Yet, with full decoupling, Chinese firms’ revenue could rise to $79 billion, leading to about a 7 percent global market share and about $11 billion more than if the United States does not fully decouple from China. (See figure 11.) Figure 11: Chinese semiconductor firms’ global market share after full decoupling versus the status quo [30] As a result of the foregone revenue, U.S. firms would invest less in R&D compared with no decoupling. Under the status quo scenario, U.S. firms could invest about $95 billion in R&D in the 10th year. In comparison, under full decoupling, U.S. firms could invest only about $78 billion, resulting in about $17 billion of foregone R&D investments. (See figure 12.) Figure 12: U.S. semiconductor firms’ investment in R&D 10 years after full decoupling versus the status quo [31] Moreover, U.S. semiconductor firms would support fewer jobs. Under a status quo growth scenario, the U.S. semiconductor industry could likely support about 500,000 industry jobs and 2.8 million downstream jobs in the U.S. economy in 10 years’ time. But in a full decoupling scenario, after 10 years, U.S. firms would only be able to support about 370,000 industry jobs and 2.1 million downstream jobs, foregoing almost 120,000 industry jobs and over 650,000 downstream jobs. (See figure 13.) Figure 13: U.S. semiconductor jobs and additional jobs 10 years after full decoupling versus the status quo [32] In the long term, regardless of the extent of decoupling, U.S. firms could lose more than they gain. Accordingly, under 50 percent decoupling, U.S. firms could forego about $46 billion in revenue, $8 billion in R&D investments, almost 60,000 industry jobs, and over 300,000 downstream jobs 10 years after the initial decoupling. As a result, U.S. firms’ market share could be about 44 percent compared to about 48 percent without decoupling, while Chinese firms’ share could be about 7 percent compared with 6 percent without decoupling. Under 25 percent decoupling, U.S. firms could forego about $23 billion in revenue, $4 billion in R&D investments, almost 30,000 industry jobs, and almost 170,000 downstream jobs. Under an Entity List scenario, U.S. firms could still forego about $9 billion in revenue, $2 billion in R&D investments, over 10,000 industry jobs, and almost 70,000 downstream jobs. (See table 7.) Table 7: Summary of decoupling impact after 10 years [33] Decoupling Scenarios Entity List 25% Decoupling 50% Decoupling Full Decoupling U.S. firms’ share of the Chinese market 23.5% 19.6% 13.1% 0.0% U.S. firms’ global market share 47.1% 45.8% 43.7% 39.5% Chinese firms’ global market share 6.4% 6.5% 6.8% 7.3% U.S. firms’ revenue foregone $9.1B $22.8B $45.5B $91.1B U.S. firms’ R&D spending foregone $1.7B $4.2B $8.3B $16.6B U.S. industry jobs foregone 11,739 29,346 58,693 117,386 U.S. downstream jobs foregone 66,910 167,275 334,549 669,099 The U.S. ICT sector is deeply reliant on the continuous advancement of semiconductor technology. Advanced chips represent the backbone of modern ICT infrastructure, powering everything from data centers and cloud computing platforms to AI systems and high-performance computing applications. Indeed, as an ITIF report estimates, an average data center relies on approximately 340,000 semiconductors to function. [34] These chips enable efficiency in processing speed, energy efficiency, and data handling capabilities, which are essential for the evolving demands of the digital economy. However, in the consistently evolving ICT sector, which requires greater efficiency every day, the U.S. semiconductor industry needs to consistently innovate and develop the next generation of chips in order to keep up with customer demand. As this report explains, the U.S. semiconductor industry’s ability to innovate could be hindered due to export controls or decoupling with China by depriving the industry of the revenues necessary to finance the R&D needed to produce the next generation of innovative chips. Corroborating this, a BCG study estimates that a technology decoupling between the U.S. semiconductor industry and China would lead to a decline of $12 billion, or 30 percent, in R&D investment. [35] While other countries’ semiconductor firms could eventually supply advanced chips, it would take significant time for them to catch up to the already sophisticated designs and capabilities of U.S. firms. [36] During that period, U.S. industries would face higher costs, limited access to cutting-edge technology, and reduced competitiveness. Below are five examples of ICT industries that would be negatively affected by decreasing R&D in the semiconductor industry: 1. Cloud computing and data centers. Cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud rely on high-performance chips to run large-scale data centers efficiently. Less-efficient semiconductors increase energy costs and reduce processing speed, limiting the ability to offer faster, cheaper, and more scalable cloud services. 2. AI and machine learning. AI systems, including natural language processing and computer vision, require advanced GPUs and AI accelerators. Slower or less-efficient chips reduce the speed of model training and inference, thereby constraining innovation and the adoption of AI tools across various industries. 3. Telecommunications and 5G networks. Next-generation 5G infrastructure depends on powerful chips to handle massive amounts of data with low latency. Reduced chip performance can slow network deployment, limit bandwidth, and degrade service quality for consumers and enterprises. Although national security concerns are very important, strategic approaches that balance these concerns with the need for technological advancement are essential to sustain the U.S. ICT sector’s leadership in the global market. 4. Enterprise software and high-performance computing (HPC). Applications such as financial modeling, scientific simulations, and big data analytics rely on fast, energy-efficient processors. Less-capable semiconductors increase computation time and costs, lowering productivity and innovation potential for these industries. 5. Consumer electronics and smart devices. Smartphones, laptops, smart home devices, and wearables depend on efficient semiconductors for battery life, speed, and advanced features. Reduced R&D in next-generation chips could delay product innovation, increase costs, and make U.S. products less competitive globally. The U.S. ICT sector’s reliance on advanced semiconductor technology necessitates continuous investment in R&D. Export controls and other measures that restrict market access could impede the development of next-generation chips, potentially hindering the growth and competitiveness of this critical industry. Policymakers should consider the long-term implications of such policies on semiconductor innovation and the broader digital economy. Although national security concerns are very important, strategic approaches that balance these concerns with the need for technological advancement are essential to sustain the U.S. ICT sector’s leadership in the global market. U.S. semiconductor export controls or broader decoupling from China would weaken the U.S. semiconductor industry and the wider economy. Limiting market access would reduce revenue for U.S. chipmakers, which would directly constrain their ability to fund R&D. Reduced R&D activity would hinder the creation of next-generation semiconductors, technologies that power critical ICT sectors such as cloud computing, AI, telecommunications, and high-performance computing. Reduced innovation in semiconductors cascades through these downstream industries, slowing technological advancement and weakening the global competitiveness of U.S. ICT firms. Lower revenue in the semiconductor industry would also force U.S. semiconductor companies to cut jobs, as they would be unable to maintain the same workforce without sufficient financial resources. Since each semiconductor job supports additional employment across the economy, the contraction in industry jobs would also reduce broader U.S. employment and economic activity. The U.S. semiconductor industry needs to continue to maintain its share of the Chinese semiconductor market in order to sustain ongoing R&D investment, which helps it maintain leadership in the industry and enables the United States to maintain its leadership in the digital economy. As such, U.S. policymakers should keep semiconductor export controls to a minimum in order to enable U.S. semiconductor firms to obtain high levels of revenue to invest in R&D. To estimate the impact of export controls or a decoupling with China on U.S. semiconductor companies, ITIF first obtained the revenue of the global semiconductor market in 2024; China’s aggregate global demand and its market share; U.S. semiconductor firms’ share of and revenue from the Chinese market; U.S. semiconductor firms’ global market share and revenue; and Chinese semiconductor firms’ global share and revenue for our baseline assumptions. (See table 8.) These values come from SIA’s publications. Table 8: Economic model’s key variables and descriptions Variable Description Global semiconductor market Size of the global semiconductor market China’s demand of global market China’s portion of global demand U.S. firms’ share of China market Estimated share of China’s market held by U.S. firms U.S. firms’ global market share U.S. semiconductor firms’ global market share Chinese firms’ global market share Chinese semiconductor firms’ global market share Using SIA’s 2025 Factbook, ITIF then obtained global semiconductor sales by type of product (e.g., logic, memory, etc.) . [37] We then estimated the total global semiconductor market for each type of semiconductor product. Assuming that the Chinese market demands the same share of each type of semiconductor product, China’s demand for each type of product in the global semiconductor market was estimated. Using U.S. semiconductor firms’ share of China’s market, ITIF also estimated U.S. firms’ revenue from the Chinese market for each type of product. These estimates were done for four different decoupling or export control scenarios: full decoupling (100 percent reduction in Chinese market access to U.S. semi), 50 percent decoupling (50 percent reduction), 25 percent decoupling (25 percent reduction), and Entity List (assuming Entity List only reduces U.S. semiconductor revenue from the Chinese market by 10 percent). (See table 9.) To simplify the analysis, ITIF assumed that U.S. firms have the same proportion of the Chinese market for all product types (though, obviously, this varies). Table 9: Economic model’s decoupling scenarios and U.S. firms’ share loss of Chinese market Decoupling Scenario U.S. Firms’ Share of Chinese Market Losses Full decoupling 100 percent loss of revenue from the Chinese market Considerable decoupling 50 percent loss of revenue from the Chinese market Partial decoupling 25 percent loss of revenue from the Chinese market Entity List 10 percent loss of revenue from the Chinese market Next, ITIF used data from BCG and SIA’s “Emerging Resilience in the Semiconductor Supply Chain” report to obtain the global semiconductor market share that China, the EU, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, the United States, and others hold for each semiconductor product type. [38] Logic semiconductor product types include general purpose logic chips, microprocessor unit chips (MPUs), microcontroller unit chips (MCUs), and digital signal processor chips (DSPs). Memory semiconductor product types only include memory chips. Discrete, analog, and optoelectronics (DAO) semiconductor product types include analog chips, optoelectronic (opto), discretes, and sensors. (See table 10.) With these observations, ITIF reduced the United States’ share and scaled the remaining nation’s share proportionally to 100 percent. In other words, the remaining nations are assumed to have taken over the United States’ shares based on their starting proportions (not including the United States). Table 10: Semiconductor product categories and product types for each category Logic Memory DAO ▪ General purpose logic chips ▪ Microprocessor units ▪ Microcontroller units ▪ Digital signal processor chips ▪ Memory chips ▪ Analog chips ▪ Optoelectronic chips ▪ Discretes ▪ Sensors Using the scaled shares of the remaining nations (not including the United States) and the U.S. firms’ revenue from China’s market for each type of product, ITIF obtained the redistribution of the U.S. firms’ revenue from China’s market to these remaining nations for each product type. This process was completed for each decoupling scenario. To estimate the impact of U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue losses on R&D investments for the four decoupling scenarios, ITIF first obtained the share of sales invested in R&D for U.S. firms and their corresponding value in 2024. Then, for each decoupling scenario, ITIF subtracted the U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue loss from the 2024 U.S. semiconductor industry’s revenue before taking the share of sales invested in R&D for U.S. firms. We then subtracted this value from U.S. semiconductor firms’ original R&D spending in 2024 to obtain the potential foregone R&D investment. To estimate the impact of U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue losses on the semiconductor industry jobs, ITIF first obtained the total number of semiconductor industry employees in 2024. Then U.S. firms’ revenue per employee was used to estimate job losses. Since it was not possible to determine the elasticity of demand for semiconductor firm’s employees, this model assumes a linear relationship between chipmakers’ employment demand and revenues. ITIF first obtained the U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue per employee by dividing the U.S. semiconductor firms’ global revenue by the number of employees. Next, the U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue loss for each decoupling scenario was divided by the U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue per employee to obtain the number of employees foregone from the decline in revenue. To assess the impact of U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue loss on non-semiconductor industry jobs, ITIF first determined the semiconductor job multiplier in 2024, which was estimated to be 5.7. [39] This means every job in the semiconductor industry generated 5.7 additional jobs in the U.S. economy. Next, the number of foregone semiconductor jobs was multiplied by 5.7 to determine the number of foregone downstream jobs. To estimate U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue foregone from decoupling with China after 5 and 10 years, ITIF first estimated the average annual growth rate of U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue from the Chinese market from 2020 to 2024. Then, for each decoupling scenario, ITIF took U.S. semiconductor firms’ losses for each semiconductor product and multiplied it by (1 + the average annual growth rate) raised to the power of 5 or 10 (years) to determine the U.S. semiconductor firms’ foregone revenues 5 and 10 years after decoupling. Moreover, the U.S. semiconductor firms’ losses that were shifted to other nations were also multiplied by the average annual growth rate to estimate how much each nation gained after 5 and 10 years from U.S. semiconductor firms’ losses from decoupling in the base year. This was done for each decoupling scenario and each semiconductor type. To determine U.S. semiconductor firms’ foregone R&D investments, ITIF first estimated the average annual share of sales invested in R&D (i.e., R&D intensity) by U.S. semiconductor firms from 2015 to 2024. The rate was then multiplied by U.S. semiconductor firms’ foregone revenue after 5 and 10 years for each decoupling scenario. To estimate the foregone semiconductor jobs from decoupling in the base year, ITIF first estimated the average annual growth rate from 2015 to 2024 for U.S. semiconductor jobs. Then the number of jobs lost after decoupling in the base year was multiplied by (1 + the average annual growth rate). This was done for each decoupling scenario. To determine the additional jobs in the economy foregone, ITIF multiplied these values by the job multiplier (5.7). This was done for each decoupling scenario. To estimate the impact of decoupling after 5 and 10 years, ITIF first obtained the average annual growth rate for the global semiconductor market from 2005 to 2024 and U.S. firms’ revenue from China’s market from 2020 to 2024. ITIF also obtained the average China market demand of the global market, U.S. firms’ global market share, and Chinese firms’ global market share from 2015 to 2024. Using the growth rates, ITIF first estimated the new global semiconductor market after 5 and 10 years. It was then assumed that China’s demand of the global market would continue to be the average of its last 10 years. Next, the new demand was multiplied by the new global semiconductor market value to determine the revenue from China’s demand of the global market. Then, ITIF estimated U.S. semiconductor firms’ share of and revenue from China’s market for each decoupling scenario after 5 and 10 years. To do so, U.S. semiconductor firms’ losses for each decoupling scenario were first subtracted from the U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue from the China market in Year 0 before decoupling to determine the remaining Chinese market that U.S. semiconductor firms retained after decoupling in Year 0. That value was then multiplied by (1 + the annual average growth rate of U.S. firms’ revenue from the China market) for 5 or 10 years after decoupling to determine the new revenue from the Chinese market for U.S. firms. These values were divided by China’s demand of the global market to determine U.S. semiconductor firms’ share of China’s market. Next, the U.S. semiconductor firms’ global market share was estimated. To do so, the average U.S. firms’ market share in the last 10 years was first multiplied by the global semiconductor market to determine U.S. firms’ new global revenue. With that value, ITIF subtracted U.S. semiconductor firms’ losses for each decoupling scenario in Year 0 multiplied by (1 + the average annual growth rate of U.S. firms’ revenue from the China market) raised to 5 or 10 (years). These values were divided by the total global semiconductor market to determine U.S. semiconductor firms’ market share. ITIF also estimated China’s market share 5 and 10 years after decoupling. To calculate this, the average Chinese firm’s market share over the last 10 years was first multiplied by the global semiconductor revenue to determine the new global revenue of Chinese firms. With that value, ITIF added the U.S. semiconductor firms’ losses that were gained by Chinese firms for each decoupling scenario in Year 0 multiplied by (1 + the average annual growth rate of U.S. firms’ revenue from the China market) raised to 5 or 10 (years). Then, these values were divided by the total global semiconductor market to determine Chinese firms’ market share. To estimate the impact of decoupling with China on U.S. semiconductor firms’ R&D spending, ITIF first estimated the average annual share of sales spent on R&D by U.S. semiconductor firms from 2015 to 2024. That average was then multiplied by the new U.S. global market share to determine U.S. firms’ new R&D amount 5 and 10 years after an initial decoupling. This was done for each decoupling scenario. To estimate the impact of decoupling with China on U.S. semiconductor industry jobs, ITIF first estimated the average annual growth rate from 2015 to 2024 for U.S. semiconductor firms’ total employees. Next, the total number of U.S. semiconductor firms’ employees in year 0 after decoupling was estimated by subtracting U.S. semiconductor firms’ job losses from each decoupling scenario from the U.S. semiconductor firms’ total employees before decoupling in year 0. These values were then multiplied by (1 + the average annual growth rate) raised to the power of 5 or 10 (years) to determine the new number of semiconductor industry employees 5 and 10 years after an initial decoupling. To estimate the additional jobs created 5 and 10 years after an initial decoupling, ITIF first assumed the job multiplier did not change. Then, the new number of semiconductor industry employees 5 and 10 years after decoupling was multiplied by the job multiplier for each decoupling scenario.

As such, U.S. policymakers should keep semiconductor export controls to a minimum. Contents Key Takeaways 1 Introduction . 3 Modeling the Economic Impact of Semiconductor Export Controls 4 Impact of Export Controls on U.S. Semiconductor Firms 6 Medium-Term Foregone Growth and Resulting Market 10 Long-Term Foregone Growth and Resulting Market 14 Impact on ICT Industries 17 Conclusion . 19 Appendix: Methodology 20 Endnotes 25 Semiconductors constitute the foundation of the global digital economy, generating $631 billion in global sales in 2024, and is projected to exceed $1 trillion by 2030, while enabling more than $7 trillion in annual downstream economic activity in fields such as artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and advanced manufacturing. [1] This represents roughly 7 percent of the world’s economic activity. [2] This report examines a hypothetical scenario in which the United States implements broader export controls and policies that effectively decouple U.S. semiconductor firms from the Chinese market. In reality, the United States has only implemented a limited set of export controls aimed at slowing China’s access to advanced semiconductors and related technologies for military and high-performance computing applications. For example, in October 2022, the Biden administration issued export controls restricting the sale of AI chips to China, along with technology to manufacture those chips. [3] Following that, in January 2025, the Department of Commerce announced a proposed AI diffusion rule that implemented a three-tiered system for access to advanced AI hardware, capping the number of advanced chips that foreign nations could receive. [4] However, those proposed rules were rescinded by the Trump administration. [5] On the other hand, the Chinese government could also impose similar restrictions on U.S. firms, resulting in a lost of access to the Chinese market. Indeed, because the Chinese government banned Micron products in critical infrastructure in 2023, the U.S. chip company intends to stop supplying server chips to China altogether. [6] Even within this limited framework, restrictions carry potential risks. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation’s (ITIF’s) economic model shows that reducing access to Chinese commercial markets in a decoupling scenario would reduce revenue for U.S. chipmakers, which in turn could lower investment in research and development (R&D), the primary driver of next-generation chips and long-term competitiveness in the industry. Slower revenue growth and innovation would not only weaken the global position of U.S. firms, but could also ripple across the broader economy by affecting high-skill jobs in semiconductor design and manufacturing and downstream employment in industries reliant on chips. In short, reduced revenues and fewer jobs would only end up harming American chip firms and American workers. This report develops an economic model to estimate the impact of U.S. semiconductor export controls if they were to lead to a full decoupling from the Chinese market. It provides the logic of the economic model followed by a summary of the semiconductor industry in 2024, which serve as the baseline for the model. Subsequently, the report estimates the initial impact of full decoupling on U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenues and R&D investments, before examining the impact on industry jobs and downstream jobs in the U.S. economy. In addition, the report estimates the market share and foregone revenue, as well as R&D investments and job losses, in both the short term and long term, assuming a full decoupling scenario. It then provides summaries of the impact from other scenarios of decoupling, such as 25 percent decoupling. The report concludes by exploring the impact of decoupling on specific information and communications technology (ICT) industry sectors. ITIF developed an economic model to estimate the impact of U.S. semiconductor export controls on China. This model estimates U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue, R&D investments, and jobs impact from four export control/decoupling scenarios: 1) full decoupling or export ban (U.S. companies are completely prohibited from selling to China); 2) 50 percent decoupling (U.S. semiconductors restricted selling to China, leading to a 50 percent revenue loss from the Chinese market); 3) 25 percent decoupling (some U.S. semiconductors cannot be sold to China, leading to a 25 percent revenue loss from the Chinese market); and 4) Entity List-based decoupling (U.S. companies cannot sell to a list of specific Chinese companies, leading to a 10 percent revenue loss from the Chinese market). (See the appendix for the full methodology.) The rationale behind the four decoupling scenarios is as follows. The United States will try to place export controls on the most important semiconductor products first before expanding the list. As such, the Entity List will first cut off some Chinese companies from a few key semiconductor products, leading U.S. firms to lose 10 percent of revenue from the Chinese market. However, gradually, the United States will expand export controls to encompass all semiconductor products, leading to a full decoupling between the two nations. This would mean that U.S. semiconductor firms would lose all their revenue from the Chinese market. The economic model measures the extent of negative impact U.S. export controls could have on U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue and share of the global industry. Assuming that the United States does not utilize the Foreign Direct Product Rule, U.S. firms’ losses could be gained by other nations, including China, the EU, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and others. Using the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and the Semiconductor Industry Association’s (SIA’s) “Emerging Resilience in the Semiconductor Supply Chain” report, ITIF estimated the global market shares of each nation for each semiconductor product in 2022. [7] (See figure 1.) Figure 1: Global market share of each semiconductor product type [8] Using this as a proxy for future global shares by nation, ITIF estimated the extent to which other nations could benefit from the lost U.S. revenue by removing the United States and scaling the remaining nations’ shares. As a result of U.S. firms’ revenue losses, their investment in R&D would also be reduced. As SIA found, U.S. semiconductor companies invested 17.7 percent of their revenue into R&D in 2024. [9] Every job in the semiconductor industry supports an additional 5.7 downstream jobs in the U.S. economy. Furthermore, the revenue losses would also mean that U.S. semiconductor companies may be unable to offer as many jobs, leading to a decline in the industry’s employment numbers. This decline would subsequently result in fewer downstream jobs being created in the U.S. economy. Indeed, as SIA found, every job in the semiconductor industry supports an additional 5.7 downstream jobs in the U.S. economy . [10] In sum, revenue losses would result in fewer jobs, reduced R&D investment, and a lower global market share for U.S. chipmakers. Figure 2 illustrates the analytical framework ITIF’s model uses to estimate the economic impact of U.S. semiconductor export controls on U.S. semiconductor firms and the U.S. economy. Figure 2: ITIF’s analytical framework for modeling the effects of U.S. semiconductor export controls on China The following sections provide background information on the global semiconductor market, the U.S. semiconductor market, China’s semiconductor market, and U.S. semiconductor firms’ share of the Chinese market in 2024. Afterward, they examine the initial impact of a full decoupling with China on U.S. firms’ revenue and other nations’ firms’ revenue. In addition, the section provides a summary of the impact of the three other decoupling scenarios: 50 percent decoupling, 25 percent decoupling, and Entity List-based export controls. The report later examines the extent to which each decoupling scenario would impact U.S. semiconductor firms’ R&D investment levels, before turning to the impact on jobs. In 2024, the global semiconductor industry generated $630.5 billion in revenue, of which U.S. semiconductor firms accounted for 50.4 percent. [11] Meanwhile, Chinese semiconductor firms accounted for 4.5 percent, or $28.4 billion. [12] China demands more chips than it produces. In 2024, China demanded 24 percent, or $151.3 billion, of the global semiconductor market. [13] Given U.S. semiconductor firms’ large market share, they supplied 50.7 percent of China’s demand in 2024. [14] (See table 1.) Table 1: Semiconductor market measures, 2024 [15] Measure Value (Billions) Share Global semiconductor market $631 100.0% Chinese firms’ global market share $28 4.5% China’s demand of global market $151 24.0% U.S. firms’ global market share $318 50.4% U.S. firms’ share of China market $77 50.7% China’s demand for semiconductors varies by type. For example, China’s computing and information technology (IT) industries may require logic chips such as central processing units, while a phone maker would need more memory chips and an electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer more sensors and microcontrollers. As such, using the SIA 2025 Factbook’s share of global demand for each semiconductor product type as a proxy, ITIF estimated China’s demand for each product type in 2024. [16] The top three semiconductor product types most demanded include logic chips (34 percent), memory chips (26 percent), and analog chips (13 percent). (See figure 3.) Figure 3: China’s chip demand by semiconductor product types [17] Since U.S. firms fulfill a significant share of China’s demand, export controls or full decoupling could have a severe impact on U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenues. They would eliminate, or at least partially reduce, U.S. firms’ ability to sell to China, thereby reducing U.S. firms’ overall revenue. In this section, ITIF uses 2024 as a baseline to estimate the revenue U.S. firms could lose and other nations’ firms could gain in the initial year after decoupling with China. Table 3 shows the potential revenue losses of U.S. firms by semiconductor product type after a full decoupling from China and the nations that could gain from U.S. firms’ losses. In the event of a complete decoupling, U.S. firms would no longer sell to China, meaning they would lose 100 percent of their revenue from China. In this scenario, U.S. firms could lose about $77 billion from complete decoupling with China. Meanwhile, mainland Chinese firms could gain about $9 billion, EU firms $15 billion, Japanese firms $12 billion, Taiwanese firms $14 billion, South Korean firms $21 billion, and other nations’ firms $5 billion of those losses.

U.S. firms could lose as much as $38.4 billion in revenue in the face of 50 percent decoupling with China. Of this, mainland Chinese firms could gain about $5 billion, South Korean firms $10 billion, and Taiwanese firms $7 billion. Under 25 percent decoupling, U.S. firms could lose about $19 billion while mainland Chinese firms could gain about $2 billion, Japanese ones $3 billion, and Taiwanese firms $4 billion. Lastly, under an Entity Listing against Chinese companies, U.S. firms could lose about $8 billion while mainland Chinese firms gain $1 billion, the EU’s firms $2 billion, and South Korea’s firms $2 billion. (See table 3.) Table 3: Foreign semiconductor firms’ potential gains from U.S. firms’ losses (billions) [19] Decoupling Scenarios United States Mainland China Japan Taiwan EU South Korea Others Full decoupling -$76.7 $9.1 $12.3 $14.1 $15.3 $20.6 $5.3 50% decoupling -$38.4 $4.5 $6.2 $7.0 $7.7 $10.3 $2.7 25% decoupling -$19.2 $2.3 $3.1 $3.5 $3.8 $5.1 $1.3 Entity List -$7.7 $0.9 $1.2 $1.4 $1.5 $2.1 $0.5 The U.S. semiconductor industry invests a significant share of its revenue in R&D to develop the next generation of globally competitive chips. In 2024 alone, the industry invested 17.7 percent of its revenue in R&D, and, on average, invested 18.3 percent from 2015 to 2024. As such, given that U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenues would decline from decoupling with China, R&D investments would also decline. Generally, the share of revenue invested in R&D would also decline when revenue declines, but ITIF kept the share constant for a more conservative estimate. The U.S. semiconductor industry invested $56.2 billion in R&D in 2024. However, if the United States fully decouples from China, U.S. firms’ R&D investments could decrease to about $43 billion, roughly $14 billion lower than the status quo. This is calculated by multiplying the industry’s R&D intensity by the lost revenues from precluded sales to China. Meanwhile, U.S. firms would likely reduce R&D investments to about $49 billion, or about $7 billion lower than the status quo, under 50 percent decoupling. Further, U.S. firms could reduce R&D investments to about $53 billion (about $3 billion lower than status quo) and $55 billion (about $1 billion lower) from 25 percent decoupling or export control entity listing, respectively. (See figure 4.) Figure 4: U.S. semiconductor firms’ future investments in R&D, by decoupling scenario [20] The robust U.S. semiconductor industry provides hundreds of thousands of jobs to the U.S. economy while simultaneously supporting downstream job creation in other sectors. For instance, a semiconductor process engineer position is one job in the economy, but it also indirectly supports logistics providers who ship the chips the engineer helps produce. Moreover, when the engineer spends their money in the economy, this further supports other jobs. For example, engineers support restaurant employees when they spend money at a restaurant. Indeed, as SIA’s 2025 Factbook highlights, a semiconductor industry job supports 5.7 additional downstream jobs in the U.S. economy. In 2024, the U.S. semiconductor industry supported approximately 345,000 direct jobs and indirectly supported nearly 2 million additional ones. However, when U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenues decline, they can no longer support as many industry jobs, leading to both direct and indirect job losses. Indeed, the U.S. semiconductor industry could support over 80,000 fewer industry jobs and almost 500,000 fewer downstream jobs if the United States fully decoupled from China. Meanwhile, the U.S. industry could support over 40,000 fewer industry jobs and more than 200,000 fewer downstream jobs in a scenario of 50 percent decoupling. A 25 percent decoupling could lead to about 20,000 fewer industry jobs and over 100,000 fewer downstream jobs. Finally, an export control entity listing could lead to over 8,000 fewer industry jobs and almost 50,000 fewer downstream jobs. (See figure 5.) In sum, significant export controls or decoupling with China could negatively impact U.S. households from decreased employment opportunities in well-paying high-tech jobs. Figure 5: U.S. semiconductor and additional job losses by decoupling scenario [21] The following section first examines the U.S. and Chinese global semiconductor market shares and revenues five years after a one-time full decoupling scenario. Afterward, it quantifies how a one-time full decoupling would negatively impact R&D investments in subsequent years, before examining the foregone jobs. If normal growth trajectories had prevailed (e.g., expected growth of China’s semiconductor market and stable U.S. market share) then after five years under a normal scenario, U.S. semiconductor companies could have been expected to earn about $84 billion from China’s market. With those revenues now lost in this full decoupling scenario, the sales would likely be accrued by other nations’ semiconductor firms. Chinese firms could gain about $10 billion, EU firms $17 billion, South Korean firms $22 billion, Japanese firms $13 billion, Taiwanese firms $15 billion, and other nations’ firms $6 billion. (See table 4.) Table 4: Foreign firms’ potential gains from U.S. firms’ losses five years after full decoupling (billions) [22] Product Type United States Mainland China Japan Taiwan EU South Korea Others Logic -$28.6 $4.1 $3.3 $9.0 $7.4 $2.5 $2.5 Memory -$21.9 $0.9 $2.0 $1.2 $0.1 $17.5 $0.1 Analog -$10.6 $1.6 $3.2 $0.9 $3.0 $0.7 $1.1 MPU -$7.2 $1.0 $0.8 $2.3 $1.8 $0.6 $0.6 Opto -$5.4 $0.8 $1.7 $0.5 $1.6 $0.4 $0.6 Discretes -$4.1 $0.6 $1.3 $0.3 $1.2 $0.3 $0.4 MCU -$2.9 $0.4 $0.3 $0.9 $0.7 $0.2 $0.2 Sensor -$2.5 $0.4 $0.8 $0.2 $0.7 $0.2 $0.3 DSP -$0.4 $0.1 $0.0 $0.1 $0.1 $0.0 $0.0 Total -$83.6 $9.9 $13.4 $15.4 $16.7 $22.4 $5.8 As a result of the revenue reduction, U.S. firms’ global market share would be lower than without decoupling after five years. Without decoupling, the U.S. semiconductor industry’s global revenue could be about $396 billion, or a market share of 48 percent. In comparison, with full decoupling, the U.S. industry’s market share would likely fall to about 38 percent, equating to about $313 billion in revenue. (See figure 6.) Figure 6: U.S. semiconductor firms’ global market share five years after full decoupling versus the status quo [23] In contrast, Chinese semiconductor firms could gain some of U.S. firms’ lost revenue and grow their overall global revenue and market share. Without decoupling, Chinese firms’ global revenue could be about $52 billion, or about 6.3 percent. However, with full decoupling, Chinese firms’ global revenue could grow to about $62 billion (about 7 percent) after five years, approximately $10 billion higher than without decoupling. (See figure 7.) Figure 7: Chinese semiconductor firms’ global market share five years after full decoupling [24] Due to the lower-than-expected revenue, U.S. firms’ R&D investments after five years would be smaller than with no decoupling. Without decoupling, U.S. firms would likely invest about $72 billion in R&D investments. Yet, U.S. firms could reduce their investments to about $57 billion under full decoupling, leading to $15 billion in foregone R&D investments. (See figure 8.) Figure 8: U.S. semiconductor firms’ investment in R&D five years after full decoupling versus the status quo [25] U.S. semiconductor firms’ lower-than-expected revenue also means that they would be able to support fewer industry and downstream jobs in the economy. Under the status quo scenario, the U.S. semiconductor industry could support about 400,000 industry jobs and 2.3 million downstream jobs. However, under full decoupling, U.S. firms could only support about 300,000 industry jobs and 1.8 million downstream jobs, leading to almost 100,000 foregone industry jobs and over 550,000 foregone downstream jobs. (See figure 9.) Figure 9: U.S. semiconductor and related jobs five years after full decoupling versus the status quo [26] In the medium term, U.S. firms would continue to forego revenue, R&D investments, and jobs in the event of any of the contemplated decoupling scenarios. Under 50 percent decoupling, U.S. firms could forego about $42 billion in revenue—resulting in a global market share of about 43 percent compared with 48 percent under the status quo—about $8 billion in R&D investments, about 50,000 industry jobs, and almost 300,000 downstream jobs after five years. Chinese firms could gain some of the U.S. firms’ losses, resulting in about a 7 percent global market share rather than 6 percent under the status quo. Under a 25 percent decoupling, U.S. firms would forego about $21 billion in revenue, $4 billion in R&D investments, almost 25,000 industry jobs and about 140,000 downstream jobs. U.S. firms’ global market share could fall to about 45 percent, while Chinese firms’ share could rise to about 7 percent. Under an Entity List scenario, U.S. firms could still forego about $8 billion in revenue, $2 billion in R&D, almost 10,000 industry jobs, and over 56,000 downstream jobs—U.S. firms’ global market share could fall to 47 percent while Chinese firms’ share could rise to 6 percent. (See table 5.)

Then, it examines the impact on U.S. semiconductor firms’ share of and revenue from the Chinese market, U.S. firms’ R&D investments, and U.S. industry and downstream jobs. Over the long run, the missing supply of semiconductors otherwise provided by U.S. firms to the Chinese market would be gained by foreign competitors, especially by China’s domestic semiconductor industry. As a result, these countries’ firms would have larger revenues to reinvest in R&D, accelerating their innovation capacity. Moreover, Chinese and other nations’ firms could steadily close the technological gap with the United States. In contrast, U.S. firms, constrained by smaller markets and diminished R&D capacity, could risk falling behind. This erosion of leadership could undermine the U.S. semiconductor industry’s central role in sustaining national competitiveness and technological primacy. ITIF estimates that, if current growth trends had prevailed and there had been no decoupling, U.S. semiconductor companies could have likely earned about $91 billion in revenues from the Chinese market 10 years from now. Again, those revenues are lost in this full decoupling scenario and instead would be accrued by firms from other nations. Here, ITIF estimates that South Korean firms could gain about $24 billion, EU firms $18 billion, and mainland Chinese firms $11 billion. Japan, Taiwan, and other nations could gain the remainder of the foregone revenue. (See table 6.) Table 6: Other nations’ gains and U.S. semiconductor firms’ foregone revenue by semiconductor product type 10 years after full decoupling (billions) [28] Product Type United States Japan Taiwan EU South Korea Mainland China Others Logic -$31.2 $3.6 $9.8 $8.0 $2.7 $4.5 $2.7 Memory -$23.9 $2.2 $1.3 $0.2 $19.1 $1.0 $0.2 Analog -$11.5 $3.5 $1.0 $3.3 $0.8 $1.8 $1.2 MPU -$7.8 $0.9 $2.5 $2.0 $0.7 $1.1 $0.7 Opto -$5.9 $1.8 $0.5 $1.7 $0.4 $0.9 $0.6 Discretes -$4.5 $1.4 $0.4 $1.3 $0.3 $0.7 $0.5 MCU -$3.1 $0.4 $1.0 $0.8 $0.3 $0.4 $0.3 Sensor -$2.7 $0.8 $0.2 $0.8 $0.2 $0.4 $0.3 DSP -$0.4 $0.0 $0.1 $0.1 $0.0 $0.1 $0.0 Total -$91.1 $14.6 $16.7 $18.2 $24.4 $10.8 $6.3 Under the status quo, U.S. firms could maintain their global market share of 48 percent, which would result in about $520 billion in global revenues 10 years on. In contrast, under full decoupling, U.S. firms’ market share would likely drop to about 40 percent, resulting in about $429 billion of global revenue. (See figure 10.) Figure 10: U.S. semiconductor firms’ global market share 10 years after full decoupling versus the status quo [29] In comparison, Chinese semiconductor firms’ global market share and revenue would be higher than no decoupling, as they would gain some of the U.S. firms’ lost revenue. Without decoupling, Chinese firms’ share could be about 6 percent, equating to a revenue of about $68 billion. Yet, with full decoupling, Chinese firms’ revenue could rise to $79 billion, leading to about a 7 percent global market share and about $11 billion more than if the United States does not fully decouple from China. (See figure 11.) Figure 11: Chinese semiconductor firms’ global market share after full decoupling versus the status quo [30] As a result of the foregone revenue, U.S. firms would invest less in R&D compared with no decoupling. Under the status quo scenario, U.S. firms could invest about $95 billion in R&D in the 10th year. In comparison, under full decoupling, U.S. firms could invest only about $78 billion, resulting in about $17 billion of foregone R&D investments. (See figure 12.) Figure 12: U.S. semiconductor firms’ investment in R&D 10 years after full decoupling versus the status quo [31] Moreover, U.S. semiconductor firms would support fewer jobs. Under a status quo growth scenario, the U.S. semiconductor industry could likely support about 500,000 industry jobs and 2.8 million downstream jobs in the U.S. economy in 10 years’ time. But in a full decoupling scenario, after 10 years, U.S. firms would only be able to support about 370,000 industry jobs and 2.1 million downstream jobs, foregoing almost 120,000 industry jobs and over 650,000 downstream jobs. (See figure 13.) Figure 13: U.S. semiconductor jobs and additional jobs 10 years after full decoupling versus the status quo [32] In the long term, regardless of the extent of decoupling, U.S. firms could lose more than they gain. Accordingly, under 50 percent decoupling, U.S. firms could forego about $46 billion in revenue, $8 billion in R&D investments, almost 60,000 industry jobs, and over 300,000 downstream jobs 10 years after the initial decoupling. As a result, U.S. firms’ market share could be about 44 percent compared to about 48 percent without decoupling, while Chinese firms’ share could be about 7 percent compared with 6 percent without decoupling. Under 25 percent decoupling, U.S. firms could forego about $23 billion in revenue, $4 billion in R&D investments, almost 30,000 industry jobs, and almost 170,000 downstream jobs. Under an Entity List scenario, U.S. firms could still forego about $9 billion in revenue, $2 billion in R&D investments, over 10,000 industry jobs, and almost 70,000 downstream jobs. (See table 7.)

Advanced chips represent the backbone of modern ICT infrastructure, powering everything from data centers and cloud computing platforms to AI systems and high-performance computing applications. Indeed, as an ITIF report estimates, an average data center relies on approximately 340,000 semiconductors to function. [34] These chips enable efficiency in processing speed, energy efficiency, and data handling capabilities, which are essential for the evolving demands of the digital economy. However, in the consistently evolving ICT sector, which requires greater efficiency every day, the U.S. semiconductor industry needs to consistently innovate and develop the next generation of chips in order to keep up with customer demand. As this report explains, the U.S. semiconductor industry’s ability to innovate could be hindered due to export controls or decoupling with China by depriving the industry of the revenues necessary to finance the R&D needed to produce the next generation of innovative chips. Corroborating this, a BCG study estimates that a technology decoupling between the U.S. semiconductor industry and China would lead to a decline of $12 billion, or 30 percent, in R&D investment. [35] While other countries’ semiconductor firms could eventually supply advanced chips, it would take significant time for them to catch up to the already sophisticated designs and capabilities of U.S. firms. [36] During that period, U.S. industries would face higher costs, limited access to cutting-edge technology, and reduced competitiveness. Below are five examples of ICT industries that would be negatively affected by decreasing R&D in the semiconductor industry: 1. Cloud computing and data centers. Cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud rely on high-performance chips to run large-scale data centers efficiently. Less-efficient semiconductors increase energy costs and reduce processing speed, limiting the ability to offer faster, cheaper, and more scalable cloud services. 2. AI and machine learning. AI systems, including natural language processing and computer vision, require advanced GPUs and AI accelerators. Slower or less-efficient chips reduce the speed of model training and inference, thereby constraining innovation and the adoption of AI tools across various industries. 3. Telecommunications and 5G networks. Next-generation 5G infrastructure depends on powerful chips to handle massive amounts of data with low latency. Reduced chip performance can slow network deployment, limit bandwidth, and degrade service quality for consumers and enterprises. Although national security concerns are very important, strategic approaches that balance these concerns with the need for technological advancement are essential to sustain the U.S. ICT sector’s leadership in the global market. 4. Enterprise software and high-performance computing (HPC). Applications such as financial modeling, scientific simulations, and big data analytics rely on fast, energy-efficient processors. Less-capable semiconductors increase computation time and costs, lowering productivity and innovation potential for these industries. 5. Consumer electronics and smart devices. Smartphones, laptops, smart home devices, and wearables depend on efficient semiconductors for battery life, speed, and advanced features. Reduced R&D in next-generation chips could delay product innovation, increase costs, and make U.S. products less competitive globally. The U.S. ICT sector’s reliance on advanced semiconductor technology necessitates continuous investment in R&D. Export controls and other measures that restrict market access could impede the development of next-generation chips, potentially hindering the growth and competitiveness of this critical industry. Policymakers should consider the long-term implications of such policies on semiconductor innovation and the broader digital economy. Although national security concerns are very important, strategic approaches that balance these concerns with the need for technological advancement are essential to sustain the U.S. ICT sector’s leadership in the global market. U.S. semiconductor export controls or broader decoupling from China would weaken the U.S. semiconductor industry and the wider economy. Limiting market access would reduce revenue for U.S. chipmakers, which would directly constrain their ability to fund R&D. Reduced R&D activity would hinder the creation of next-generation semiconductors, technologies that power critical ICT sectors such as cloud computing, AI, telecommunications, and high-performance computing. Reduced innovation in semiconductors cascades through these downstream industries, slowing technological advancement and weakening the global competitiveness of U.S. ICT firms. Lower revenue in the semiconductor industry would also force U.S. semiconductor companies to cut jobs, as they would be unable to maintain the same workforce without sufficient financial resources. Since each semiconductor job supports additional employment across the economy, the contraction in industry jobs would also reduce broader U.S. employment and economic activity. The U.S. semiconductor industry needs to continue to maintain its share of the Chinese semiconductor market in order to sustain ongoing R&D investment, which helps it maintain leadership in the industry and enables the United States to maintain its leadership in the digital economy. As such, U.S. policymakers should keep semiconductor export controls to a minimum in order to enable U.S. semiconductor firms to obtain high levels of revenue to invest in R&D. To estimate the impact of export controls or a decoupling with China on U.S. semiconductor companies, ITIF first obtained the revenue of the global semiconductor market in 2024; China’s aggregate global demand and its market share; U.S. semiconductor firms’ share of and revenue from the Chinese market; U.S. semiconductor firms’ global market share and revenue; and Chinese semiconductor firms’ global share and revenue for our baseline assumptions. (See table 8.) These values come from SIA’s publications. Table 8: Economic model’s key variables and descriptions Variable Description Global semiconductor market Size of the global semiconductor market China’s demand of global market China’s portion of global demand U.S. firms’ share of China market Estimated share of China’s market held by U.S. firms U.S. firms’ global market share U.S. semiconductor firms’ global market share Chinese firms’ global market share Chinese semiconductor firms’ global market share Using SIA’s 2025 Factbook, ITIF then obtained global semiconductor sales by type of product (e.g., logic, memory, etc.) . [37] We then estimated the total global semiconductor market for each type of semiconductor product. Assuming that the Chinese market demands the same share of each type of semiconductor product, China’s demand for each type of product in the global semiconductor market was estimated. Using U.S. semiconductor firms’ share of China’s market, ITIF also estimated U.S. firms’ revenue from the Chinese market for each type of product. These estimates were done for four different decoupling or export control scenarios: full decoupling (100 percent reduction in Chinese market access to U.S. semi), 50 percent decoupling (50 percent reduction), 25 percent decoupling (25 percent reduction), and Entity List (assuming Entity List only reduces U.S. semiconductor revenue from the Chinese market by 10 percent). (See table 9.) To simplify the analysis, ITIF assumed that U.S. firms have the same proportion of the Chinese market for all product types (though, obviously, this varies). Table 9: Economic model’s decoupling scenarios and U.S. firms’ share loss of Chinese market Decoupling Scenario U.S. Firms’ Share of Chinese Market Losses Full decoupling 100 percent loss of revenue from the Chinese market Considerable decoupling 50 percent loss of revenue from the Chinese market Partial decoupling 25 percent loss of revenue from the Chinese market Entity List 10 percent loss of revenue from the Chinese market Next, ITIF used data from BCG and SIA’s “Emerging Resilience in the Semiconductor Supply Chain” report to obtain the global semiconductor market share that China, the EU, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, the United States, and others hold for each semiconductor product type. [38] Logic semiconductor product types include general purpose logic chips, microprocessor unit chips (MPUs), microcontroller unit chips (MCUs), and digital signal processor chips (DSPs). Memory semiconductor product types only include memory chips. Discrete, analog, and optoelectronics (DAO) semiconductor product types include analog chips, optoelectronic (opto), discretes, and sensors. (See table 10.) With these observations, ITIF reduced the United States’ share and scaled the remaining nation’s share proportionally to 100 percent. In other words, the remaining nations are assumed to have taken over the United States’ shares based on their starting proportions (not including the United States). Table 10: Semiconductor product categories and product types for each category Logic Memory DAO ▪ General purpose logic chips ▪ Microprocessor units ▪ Microcontroller units ▪ Digital signal processor chips ▪ Memory chips ▪ Analog chips ▪ Optoelectronic chips ▪ Discretes ▪ Sensors Using the scaled shares of the remaining nations (not including the United States) and the U.S. firms’ revenue from China’s market for each type of product, ITIF obtained the redistribution of the U.S. firms’ revenue from China’s market to these remaining nations for each product type. This process was completed for each decoupling scenario. To estimate the impact of U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue losses on R&D investments for the four decoupling scenarios, ITIF first obtained the share of sales invested in R&D for U.S. firms and their corresponding value in 2024. Then, for each decoupling scenario, ITIF subtracted the U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue loss from the 2024 U.S. semiconductor industry’s revenue before taking the share of sales invested in R&D for U.S. firms. We then subtracted this value from U.S. semiconductor firms’ original R&D spending in 2024 to obtain the potential foregone R&D investment. To estimate the impact of U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue losses on the semiconductor industry jobs, ITIF first obtained the total number of semiconductor industry employees in 2024. Then U.S. firms’ revenue per employee was used to estimate job losses. Since it was not possible to determine the elasticity of demand for semiconductor firm’s employees, this model assumes a linear relationship between chipmakers’ employment demand and revenues. ITIF first obtained the U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue per employee by dividing the U.S. semiconductor firms’ global revenue by the number of employees. Next, the U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue loss for each decoupling scenario was divided by the U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue per employee to obtain the number of employees foregone from the decline in revenue. To assess the impact of U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue loss on non-semiconductor industry jobs, ITIF first determined the semiconductor job multiplier in 2024, which was estimated to be 5.7. [39] This means every job in the semiconductor industry generated 5.7 additional jobs in the U.S. economy. Next, the number of foregone semiconductor jobs was multiplied by 5.7 to determine the number of foregone downstream jobs. To estimate U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue foregone from decoupling with China after 5 and 10 years, ITIF first estimated the average annual growth rate of U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue from the Chinese market from 2020 to 2024. Then, for each decoupling scenario, ITIF took U.S. semiconductor firms’ losses for each semiconductor product and multiplied it by (1 + the average annual growth rate) raised to the power of 5 or 10 (years) to determine the U.S. semiconductor firms’ foregone revenues 5 and 10 years after decoupling. Moreover, the U.S. semiconductor firms’ losses that were shifted to other nations were also multiplied by the average annual growth rate to estimate how much each nation gained after 5 and 10 years from U.S. semiconductor firms’ losses from decoupling in the base year. This was done for each decoupling scenario and each semiconductor type. To determine U.S. semiconductor firms’ foregone R&D investments, ITIF first estimated the average annual share of sales invested in R&D (i.e., R&D intensity) by U.S. semiconductor firms from 2015 to 2024. The rate was then multiplied by U.S. semiconductor firms’ foregone revenue after 5 and 10 years for each decoupling scenario. To estimate the foregone semiconductor jobs from decoupling in the base year, ITIF first estimated the average annual growth rate from 2015 to 2024 for U.S. semiconductor jobs. Then the number of jobs lost after decoupling in the base year was multiplied by (1 + the average annual growth rate). This was done for each decoupling scenario. To determine the additional jobs in the economy foregone, ITIF multiplied these values by the job multiplier (5.7). This was done for each decoupling scenario. To estimate the impact of decoupling after 5 and 10 years, ITIF first obtained the average annual growth rate for the global semiconductor market from 2005 to 2024 and U.S. firms’ revenue from China’s market from 2020 to 2024. ITIF also obtained the average China market demand of the global market, U.S. firms’ global market share, and Chinese firms’ global market share from 2015 to 2024. Using the growth rates, ITIF first estimated the new global semiconductor market after 5 and 10 years. It was then assumed that China’s demand of the global market would continue to be the average of its last 10 years. Next, the new demand was multiplied by the new global semiconductor market value to determine the revenue from China’s demand of the global market. Then, ITIF estimated U.S. semiconductor firms’ share of and revenue from China’s market for each decoupling scenario after 5 and 10 years. To do so, U.S. semiconductor firms’ losses for each decoupling scenario were first subtracted from the U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue from the China market in Year 0 before decoupling to determine the remaining Chinese market that U.S. semiconductor firms retained after decoupling in Year 0. That value was then multiplied by (1 + the annual average growth rate of U.S. firms’ revenue from the China market) for 5 or 10 years after decoupling to determine the new revenue from the Chinese market for U.S. firms. These values were divided by China’s demand of the global market to determine U.S. semiconductor firms’ share of China’s market. Next, the U.S. semiconductor firms’ global market share was estimated. To do so, the average U.S. firms’ market share in the last 10 years was first multiplied by the global semiconductor market to determine U.S. firms’ new global revenue. With that value, ITIF subtracted U.S. semiconductor firms’ losses for each decoupling scenario in Year 0 multiplied by (1 + the average annual growth rate of U.S. firms’ revenue from the China market) raised to 5 or 10 (years). These values were divided by the total global semiconductor market to determine U.S. semiconductor firms’ market share. ITIF also estimated China’s market share 5 and 10 years after decoupling. To calculate this, the average Chinese firm’s market share over the last 10 years was first multiplied by the global semiconductor revenue to determine the new global revenue of Chinese firms. With that value, ITIF added the U.S. semiconductor firms’ losses that were gained by Chinese firms for each decoupling scenario in Year 0 multiplied by (1 + the average annual growth rate of U.S. firms’ revenue from the China market) raised to 5 or 10 (years). Then, these values were divided by the total global semiconductor market to determine Chinese firms’ market share. To estimate the impact of decoupling with China on U.S. semiconductor firms’ R&D spending, ITIF first estimated the average annual share of sales spent on R&D by U.S. semiconductor firms from 2015 to 2024. That average was then multiplied by the new U.S. global market share to determine U.S. firms’ new R&D amount 5 and 10 years after an initial decoupling. This was done for each decoupling scenario. To estimate the impact of decoupling with China on U.S. semiconductor industry jobs, ITIF first estimated the average annual growth rate from 2015 to 2024 for U.S. semiconductor firms’ total employees. Next, the total number of U.S. semiconductor firms’ employees in year 0 after decoupling was estimated by subtracting U.S. semiconductor firms’ job losses from each decoupling scenario from the U.S. semiconductor firms’ total employees before decoupling in year 0. These values were then multiplied by (1 + the average annual growth rate) raised to the power of 5 or 10 (years) to determine the new number of semiconductor industry employees 5 and 10 years after an initial decoupling. To estimate the additional jobs created 5 and 10 years after an initial decoupling, ITIF first assumed the job multiplier did not change. Then, the new number of semiconductor industry employees 5 and 10 years after decoupling was multiplied by the job multiplier for each decoupling scenario.

As such , U.S. policymakers should keep semiconductor export controls to a minimum . Contents Key Takeaways 1 Introduction . 3 Modeling the Economic Impact of Semiconductor Export Controls 4 Impact of Export Controls on U.S. Semiconductor Firms 6 Medium-Term Foregone Growth and Resulting Market 10 Long-Term Foregone Growth and Resulting Market 14 Impact on ICT Industries 17 Conclusion . 19 Appendix : Methodology 20 Endnotes 25 Semiconductors constitute the foundation of the global digital economy , generating $ 631 billion in global sales in 2024 , and is projected to exceed $ 1 trillion by 2030 , while enabling more than $ 7 trillion in annual downstream economic activity in fields such as artificial intelligence ( AI ) , cloud computing , and advanced manufacturing . [ 1 ] This represents roughly 7 percent of the world ’ s economic activity . [ 2 ] This report examines a hypothetical scenario in which the United States implements broader export controls and policies that effectively decouple U.S. semiconductor firms from the Chinese market . In reality , the United States has only implemented a limited set of export controls aimed at slowing China ’ s access to advanced semiconductors and related technologies for military and high-performance computing applications . For example , in October 2022 , the Biden administration issued export controls restricting the sale of AI chips to China , along with technology to manufacture those chips . [ 3 ] Following that , in January 2025 , the Department of Commerce announced a proposed AI diffusion rule that implemented a three-tiered system for access to advanced AI hardware , capping the number of advanced chips that foreign nations could receive . [ 4 ] However , those proposed rules were rescinded by the Trump administration . [ 5 ] On the other hand , the Chinese government could also impose similar restrictions on U.S. firms , resulting in a lost of access to the Chinese market . Indeed , because the Chinese government banned Micron products in critical infrastructure in 2023 , the U.S. chip company intends to stop supplying server chips to China altogether . [ 6 ] Even within this limited framework , restrictions carry potential risks . The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation ’ s ( ITIF ’ s ) economic model shows that reducing access to Chinese commercial markets in a decoupling scenario would reduce revenue for U.S. chipmakers , which in turn could lower investment in research and development ( R & D ) , the primary driver of next-generation chips and long-term competitiveness in the industry . Slower revenue growth and innovation would not only weaken the global position of U.S. firms , but could also ripple across the broader economy by affecting high-skill jobs in semiconductor design and manufacturing and downstream employment in industries reliant on chips . In short , reduced revenues and fewer jobs would only end up harming American chip firms and American workers . This report develops an economic model to estimate the impact of U.S. semiconductor export controls if they were to lead to a full decoupling from the Chinese market . It provides the logic of the economic model followed by a summary of the semiconductor industry in 2024 , which serve as the baseline for the model . Subsequently , the report estimates the initial impact of full decoupling on U.S. semiconductor firms ’ revenues and R & D investments , before examining the impact on industry jobs and downstream jobs in the U.S. economy . In addition , the report estimates the market share and foregone revenue , as well as R & D investments and job losses , in both the short term and long term , assuming a full decoupling scenario . It then provides summaries of the impact from other scenarios of decoupling , such as 25 percent decoupling . The report concludes by exploring the impact of decoupling on specific information and communications technology ( ICT ) industry sectors . ITIF developed an economic model to estimate the impact of U.S. semiconductor export controls on China . This model estimates U.S. semiconductor firms ’ revenue , R & D investments , and jobs impact from four export control/decoupling scenarios : 1 ) full decoupling or export ban ( U.S. companies are completely prohibited from selling to China ) ; 2 ) 50 percent decoupling ( U.S. semiconductors restricted selling to China , leading to a 50 percent revenue loss from the Chinese market ) ; 3 ) 25 percent decoupling ( some U.S. semiconductors can not be sold to China , leading to a 25 percent revenue loss from the Chinese market ) ; and 4 ) Entity List-based decoupling ( U.S. companies can not sell to a list of specific Chinese companies , leading to a 10 percent revenue loss from the Chinese market ) . ( See the appendix for the full methodology . ) The rationale behind the four decoupling scenarios is as follows . The United States will try to place export controls on the most important semiconductor products first before expanding the list . As such , the Entity List will first cut off some Chinese companies from a few key semiconductor products , leading U.S. firms to lose 10 percent of revenue from the Chinese market . However , gradually , the United States will expand export controls to encompass all semiconductor products , leading to a full decoupling between the two nations . This would mean that U.S. semiconductor firms would lose all their revenue from the Chinese market . The economic model measures the extent of negative impact U.S. export controls could have on U.S. semiconductor firms ’ revenue and share of the global industry . Assuming that the United States does not utilize the Foreign Direct Product Rule , U.S. firms ’ losses could be gained by other nations , including China , the EU , Japan , Taiwan , South Korea , and others . Using the Boston Consulting Group ( BCG ) and the Semiconductor Industry Association ’ s ( SIA ’ s ) “ Emerging Resilience in the Semiconductor Supply Chain ” report , ITIF estimated the global market shares of each nation for each semiconductor product in 2022 . [ 7 ] ( See figure 1 . ) Figure 1 : Global market share of each semiconductor product type [ 8 ] Using this as a proxy for future global shares by nation , ITIF estimated the extent to which other nations could benefit from the lost U.S. revenue by removing the United States and scaling the remaining nations ’ shares . As a result of U.S. firms ’ revenue losses , their investment in R & D would also be reduced . As SIA found , U.S. semiconductor companies invested 17.7 percent of their revenue into R & D in 2024 . [ 9 ] Every job in the semiconductor industry supports an additional 5.7 downstream jobs in the U.S. economy . Furthermore , the revenue losses would also mean that U.S. semiconductor companies may be unable to offer as many jobs , leading to a decline in the industry ’ s employment numbers . This decline would subsequently result in fewer downstream jobs being created in the U.S. economy . Indeed , as SIA found , every job in the semiconductor industry supports an additional 5.7 downstream jobs in the U.S. economy . [ 10 ] In sum , revenue losses would result in fewer jobs , reduced R & D investment , and a lower global market share for U.S. chipmakers . Figure 2 illustrates the analytical framework ITIF ’ s model uses to estimate the economic impact of U.S. semiconductor export controls on U.S. semiconductor firms and the U.S. economy . Figure 2 : ITIF ’ s analytical framework for modeling the effects of U.S. semiconductor export controls on China The following sections provide background information on the global semiconductor market , the U.S. semiconductor market , China ’ s semiconductor market , and U.S. semiconductor firms ’ share of the Chinese market in 2024 . Afterward , they examine the initial impact of a full decoupling with China on U.S. firms ’ revenue and other nations ’ firms ’ revenue . In addition , the section provides a summary of the impact of the three other decoupling scenarios : 50 percent decoupling , 25 percent decoupling , and Entity List-based export controls . The report later examines the extent to which each decoupling scenario would impact U.S. semiconductor firms ’ R & D investment levels , before turning to the impact on jobs . In 2024 , the global semiconductor industry generated $ 630.5 billion in revenue , of which U.S. semiconductor firms accounted for 50.4 percent . [ 11 ] Meanwhile , Chinese semiconductor firms accounted for 4.5 percent , or $ 28.4 billion . [ 12 ] China demands more chips than it produces . In 2024 , China demanded 24 percent , or $ 151.3 billion , of the global semiconductor market . [ 13 ] Given U.S. semiconductor firms ’ large market share , they supplied 50.7 percent of China ’ s demand in 2024 . [ 14 ] ( See table 1 . ) Table 1 : Semiconductor market measures , 2024 [ 15 ] Measure Value ( Billions ) Share Global semiconductor market $ 631 100.0 % Chinese firms ’ global market share $ 28 4.5 % China ’ s demand of global market $ 151 24.0 % U.S. firms ’ global market share $ 318 50.4 % U.S. firms ’ share of China market $ 77 50.7 % China ’ s demand for semiconductors varies by type . For example , China ’ s computing and information technology ( IT ) industries may require logic chips such as central processing units , while a phone maker would need more memory chips and an electric vehicle ( EV ) manufacturer more sensors and microcontrollers . As such , using the SIA 2025 Factbook ’ s share of global demand for each semiconductor product type as a proxy , ITIF estimated China ’ s demand for each product type in 2024 . [ 16 ] The top three semiconductor product types most demanded include logic chips ( 34 percent ) , memory chips ( 26 percent ) , and analog chips ( 13 percent ) . ( See figure 3 . ) Figure 3 : China ’ s chip demand by semiconductor product types [ 17 ] Since U.S. firms fulfill a significant share of China ’ s demand , export controls or full decoupling could have a severe impact on U.S. semiconductor firms ’ revenues . They would eliminate , or at least partially reduce , U.S. firms ’ ability to sell to China , thereby reducing U.S. firms ’ overall revenue . In this section , ITIF uses 2024 as a baseline to estimate the revenue U.S. firms could lose and other nations ’ firms could gain in the initial year after decoupling with China . Table 3 shows the potential revenue losses of U.S. firms by semiconductor product type after a full decoupling from China and the nations that could gain from U.S. firms ’ losses . In the event of a complete decoupling , U.S. firms would no longer sell to China , meaning they would lose 100 percent of their revenue from China . In this scenario , U.S. firms could lose about $ 77 billion from complete decoupling with China . Meanwhile , mainland Chinese firms could gain about $ 9 billion , EU firms $ 15 billion , Japanese firms $ 12 billion , Taiwanese firms $ 14 billion , South Korean firms $ 21 billion , and other nations ’ firms $ 5 billion of those losses .

U.S. firms could lose as much as $ 38.4 billion in revenue in the face of 50 percent decoupling with China . Of this , mainland Chinese firms could gain about $ 5 billion , South Korean firms $ 10 billion , and Taiwanese firms $ 7 billion . Under 25 percent decoupling , U.S. firms could lose about $ 19 billion while mainland Chinese firms could gain about $ 2 billion , Japanese ones $ 3 billion , and Taiwanese firms $ 4 billion . Lastly , under an Entity Listing against Chinese companies , U.S. firms could lose about $ 8 billion while mainland Chinese firms gain $ 1 billion , the EU ’ s firms $ 2 billion , and South Korea ’ s firms $ 2 billion . ( See table 3 . ) Table 3 : Foreign semiconductor firms ’ potential gains from U.S. firms ’ losses ( billions ) [ 19 ] Decoupling Scenarios United States Mainland China Japan Taiwan EU South Korea Others Full decoupling - $ 76.7 $ 9.1 $ 12.3 $ 14.1 $ 15.3 $ 20.6 $ 5.3 50 % decoupling - $ 38.4 $ 4.5 $ 6.2 $ 7.0 $ 7.7 $ 10.3 $ 2.7 25 % decoupling - $ 19.2 $ 2.3 $ 3.1 $ 3.5 $ 3.8 $ 5.1 $ 1.3 Entity List - $ 7.7 $ 0.9 $ 1.2 $ 1.4 $ 1.5 $ 2.1 $ 0.5 The U.S. semiconductor industry invests a significant share of its revenue in R & D to develop the next generation of globally competitive chips . In 2024 alone , the industry invested 17.7 percent of its revenue in R & D , and , on average , invested 18.3 percent from 2015 to 2024 . As such , given that U.S. semiconductor firms ’ revenues would decline from decoupling with China , R & D investments would also decline . Generally , the share of revenue invested in R & D would also decline when revenue declines , but ITIF kept the share constant for a more conservative estimate . The U.S. semiconductor industry invested $ 56.2 billion in R & D in 2024 . However , if the United States fully decouples from China , U.S. firms ’ R & D investments could decrease to about $ 43 billion , roughly $ 14 billion lower than the status quo . This is calculated by multiplying the industry ’ s R & D intensity by the lost revenues from precluded sales to China . Meanwhile , U.S. firms would likely reduce R & D investments to about $ 49 billion , or about $ 7 billion lower than the status quo , under 50 percent decoupling . Further , U.S. firms could reduce R & D investments to about $ 53 billion ( about $ 3 billion lower than status quo ) and $ 55 billion ( about $ 1 billion lower ) from 25 percent decoupling or export control entity listing , respectively . ( See figure 4 . ) Figure 4 : U.S. semiconductor firms ’ future investments in R & D , by decoupling scenario [ 20 ] The robust U.S. semiconductor industry provides hundreds of thousands of jobs to the U.S. economy while simultaneously supporting downstream job creation in other sectors . For instance , a semiconductor process engineer position is one job in the economy , but it also indirectly supports logistics providers who ship the chips the engineer helps produce . Moreover , when the engineer spends their money in the economy , this further supports other jobs . For example , engineers support restaurant employees when they spend money at a restaurant . Indeed , as SIA ’ s 2025 Factbook highlights , a semiconductor industry job supports 5.7 additional downstream jobs in the U.S. economy . In 2024 , the U.S. semiconductor industry supported approximately 345,000 direct jobs and indirectly supported nearly 2 million additional ones . However , when U.S. semiconductor firms ’ revenues decline , they can no longer support as many industry jobs , leading to both direct and indirect job losses . Indeed , the U.S. semiconductor industry could support over 80,000 fewer industry jobs and almost 500,000 fewer downstream jobs if the United States fully decoupled from China . Meanwhile , the U.S. industry could support over 40,000 fewer industry jobs and more than 200,000 fewer downstream jobs in a scenario of 50 percent decoupling . A 25 percent decoupling could lead to about 20,000 fewer industry jobs and over 100,000 fewer downstream jobs . Finally , an export control entity listing could lead to over 8,000 fewer industry jobs and almost 50,000 fewer downstream jobs . ( See figure 5 . ) In sum , significant export controls or decoupling with China could negatively impact U.S. households from decreased employment opportunities in well-paying high-tech jobs . Figure 5 : U.S. semiconductor and additional job losses by decoupling scenario [ 21 ] The following section first examines the U.S. and Chinese global semiconductor market shares and revenues five years after a one-time full decoupling scenario . Afterward , it quantifies how a one-time full decoupling would negatively impact R & D investments in subsequent years , before examining the foregone jobs . If normal growth trajectories had prevailed ( e.g. , expected growth of China ’ s semiconductor market and stable U.S. market share ) then after five years under a normal scenario , U.S. semiconductor companies could have been expected to earn about $ 84 billion from China ’ s market . With those revenues now lost in this full decoupling scenario , the sales would likely be accrued by other nations ’ semiconductor firms . Chinese firms could gain about $ 10 billion , EU firms $ 17 billion , South Korean firms $ 22 billion , Japanese firms $ 13 billion , Taiwanese firms $ 15 billion , and other nations ’ firms $ 6 billion . ( See table 4 . ) Table 4 : Foreign firms ’ potential gains from U.S. firms ’ losses five years after full decoupling ( billions ) [ 22 ] Product Type United States Mainland China Japan Taiwan EU South Korea Others Logic - $ 28.6 $ 4.1 $ 3.3 $ 9.0 $ 7.4 $ 2.5 $ 2.5 Memory - $ 21.9 $ 0.9 $ 2.0 $ 1.2 $ 0.1 $ 17.5 $ 0.1 Analog - $ 10.6 $ 1.6 $ 3.2 $ 0.9 $ 3.0 $ 0.7 $ 1.1 MPU - $ 7.2 $ 1.0 $ 0.8 $ 2.3 $ 1.8 $ 0.6 $ 0.6 Opto - $ 5.4 $ 0.8 $ 1.7 $ 0.5 $ 1.6 $ 0.4 $ 0.6 Discretes - $ 4.1 $ 0.6 $ 1.3 $ 0.3 $ 1.2 $ 0.3 $ 0.4 MCU - $ 2.9 $ 0.4 $ 0.3 $ 0.9 $ 0.7 $ 0.2 $ 0.2 Sensor - $ 2.5 $ 0.4 $ 0.8 $ 0.2 $ 0.7 $ 0.2 $ 0.3 DSP - $ 0.4 $ 0.1 $ 0.0 $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 0.0 $ 0.0 Total - $ 83.6 $ 9.9 $ 13.4 $ 15.4 $ 16.7 $ 22.4 $ 5.8 As a result of the revenue reduction , U.S. firms ’ global market share would be lower than without decoupling after five years . Without decoupling , the U.S. semiconductor industry ’ s global revenue could be about $ 396 billion , or a market share of 48 percent . In comparison , with full decoupling , the U.S. industry ’ s market share would likely fall to about 38 percent , equating to about $ 313 billion in revenue . ( See figure 6 . ) Figure 6 : U.S. semiconductor firms ’ global market share five years after full decoupling versus the status quo [ 23 ] In contrast , Chinese semiconductor firms could gain some of U.S. firms ’ lost revenue and grow their overall global revenue and market share . Without decoupling , Chinese firms ’ global revenue could be about $ 52 billion , or about 6.3 percent . However , with full decoupling , Chinese firms ’ global revenue could grow to about $ 62 billion ( about 7 percent ) after five years , approximately $ 10 billion higher than without decoupling . ( See figure 7 . ) Figure 7 : Chinese semiconductor firms ’ global market share five years after full decoupling [ 24 ] Due to the lower-than-expected revenue , U.S. firms ’ R & D investments after five years would be smaller than with no decoupling . Without decoupling , U.S. firms would likely invest about $ 72 billion in R & D investments . Yet , U.S. firms could reduce their investments to about $ 57 billion under full decoupling , leading to $ 15 billion in foregone R & D investments . ( See figure 8 . ) Figure 8 : U.S. semiconductor firms ’ investment in R & D five years after full decoupling versus the status quo [ 25 ] U.S. semiconductor firms ’ lower-than-expected revenue also means that they would be able to support fewer industry and downstream jobs in the economy . Under the status quo scenario , the U.S. semiconductor industry could support about 400,000 industry jobs and 2.3 million downstream jobs . However , under full decoupling , U.S. firms could only support about 300,000 industry jobs and 1.8 million downstream jobs , leading to almost 100,000 foregone industry jobs and over 550,000 foregone downstream jobs . ( See figure 9 . ) Figure 9 : U.S. semiconductor and related jobs five years after full decoupling versus the status quo [ 26 ] In the medium term , U.S. firms would continue to forego revenue , R & D investments , and jobs in the event of any of the contemplated decoupling scenarios . Under 50 percent decoupling , U.S. firms could forego about $ 42 billion in revenue—resulting in a global market share of about 43 percent compared with 48 percent under the status quo—about $ 8 billion in R & D investments , about 50,000 industry jobs , and almost 300,000 downstream jobs after five years . Chinese firms could gain some of the U.S. firms ’ losses , resulting in about a 7 percent global market share rather than 6 percent under the status quo . Under a 25 percent decoupling , U.S. firms would forego about $ 21 billion in revenue , $ 4 billion in R & D investments , almost 25,000 industry jobs and about 140,000 downstream jobs . U.S. firms ’ global market share could fall to about 45 percent , while Chinese firms ’ share could rise to about 7 percent . Under an Entity List scenario , U.S. firms could still forego about $ 8 billion in revenue , $ 2 billion in R & D , almost 10,000 industry jobs , and over 56,000 downstream jobs—U.S . firms ’ global market share could fall to 47 percent while Chinese firms ’ share could rise to 6 percent .

Then , it examines the impact on U.S. semiconductor firms ’ share of and revenue from the Chinese market , U.S. firms ’ R & D investments , and U.S. industry and downstream jobs . Over the long run , the missing supply of semiconductors otherwise provided by U.S. firms to the Chinese market would be gained by foreign competitors , especially by China ’ s domestic semiconductor industry . As a result , these countries ’ firms would have larger revenues to reinvest in R & D , accelerating their innovation capacity . Moreover , Chinese and other nations ’ firms could steadily close the technological gap with the United States . In contrast , U.S. firms , constrained by smaller markets and diminished R & D capacity , could risk falling behind . This erosion of leadership could undermine the U.S. semiconductor industry ’ s central role in sustaining national competitiveness and technological primacy . ITIF estimates that , if current growth trends had prevailed and there had been no decoupling , U.S. semiconductor companies could have likely earned about $ 91 billion in revenues from the Chinese market 10 years from now . Again , those revenues are lost in this full decoupling scenario and instead would be accrued by firms from other nations . Here , ITIF estimates that South Korean firms could gain about $ 24 billion , EU firms $ 18 billion , and mainland Chinese firms $ 11 billion . Japan , Taiwan , and other nations could gain the remainder of the foregone revenue . ( See table 6 . ) Table 6 : Other nations ’ gains and U.S. semiconductor firms ’ foregone revenue by semiconductor product type 10 years after full decoupling ( billions ) [ 28 ] Product Type United States Japan Taiwan EU South Korea Mainland China Others Logic - $ 31.2 $ 3.6 $ 9.8 $ 8.0 $ 2.7 $ 4.5 $ 2.7 Memory - $ 23.9 $ 2.2 $ 1.3 $ 0.2 $ 19.1 $ 1.0 $ 0.2 Analog - $ 11.5 $ 3.5 $ 1.0 $ 3.3 $ 0.8 $ 1.8 $ 1.2 MPU - $ 7.8 $ 0.9 $ 2.5 $ 2.0 $ 0.7 $ 1.1 $ 0.7 Opto - $ 5.9 $ 1.8 $ 0.5 $ 1.7 $ 0.4 $ 0.9 $ 0.6 Discretes - $ 4.5 $ 1.4 $ 0.4 $ 1.3 $ 0.3 $ 0.7 $ 0.5 MCU - $ 3.1 $ 0.4 $ 1.0 $ 0.8 $ 0.3 $ 0.4 $ 0.3 Sensor - $ 2.7 $ 0.8 $ 0.2 $ 0.8 $ 0.2 $ 0.4 $ 0.3 DSP - $ 0.4 $ 0.0 $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 0.0 $ 0.1 $ 0.0 Total - $ 91.1 $ 14.6 $ 16.7 $ 18.2 $ 24.4 $ 10.8 $ 6.3 Under the status quo , U.S. firms could maintain their global market share of 48 percent , which would result in about $ 520 billion in global revenues 10 years on . In contrast , under full decoupling , U.S. firms ’ market share would likely drop to about 40 percent , resulting in about $ 429 billion of global revenue . ( See figure 10 . ) Figure 10 : U.S. semiconductor firms ’ global market share 10 years after full decoupling versus the status quo [ 29 ] In comparison , Chinese semiconductor firms ’ global market share and revenue would be higher than no decoupling , as they would gain some of the U.S. firms ’ lost revenue . Without decoupling , Chinese firms ’ share could be about 6 percent , equating to a revenue of about $ 68 billion . Yet , with full decoupling , Chinese firms ’ revenue could rise to $ 79 billion , leading to about a 7 percent global market share and about $ 11 billion more than if the United States does not fully decouple from China . ( See figure 11 . ) Figure 11 : Chinese semiconductor firms ’ global market share after full decoupling versus the status quo [ 30 ] As a result of the foregone revenue , U.S. firms would invest less in R & D compared with no decoupling . Under the status quo scenario , U.S. firms could invest about $ 95 billion in R & D in the 10th year . In comparison , under full decoupling , U.S. firms could invest only about $ 78 billion , resulting in about $ 17 billion of foregone R & D investments . ( See figure 12 . ) Figure 12 : U.S. semiconductor firms ’ investment in R & D 10 years after full decoupling versus the status quo [ 31 ] Moreover , U.S. semiconductor firms would support fewer jobs . Under a status quo growth scenario , the U.S. semiconductor industry could likely support about 500,000 industry jobs and 2.8 million downstream jobs in the U.S. economy in 10 years ’ time . But in a full decoupling scenario , after 10 years , U.S. firms would only be able to support about 370,000 industry jobs and 2.1 million downstream jobs , foregoing almost 120,000 industry jobs and over 650,000 downstream jobs . ( See figure 13 . ) Figure 13 : U.S. semiconductor jobs and additional jobs 10 years after full decoupling versus the status quo [ 32 ] In the long term , regardless of the extent of decoupling , U.S. firms could lose more than they gain . Accordingly , under 50 percent decoupling , U.S. firms could forego about $ 46 billion in revenue , $ 8 billion in R & D investments , almost 60,000 industry jobs , and over 300,000 downstream jobs 10 years after the initial decoupling . As a result , U.S. firms ’ market share could be about 44 percent compared to about 48 percent without decoupling , while Chinese firms ’ share could be about 7 percent compared with 6 percent without decoupling . Under 25 percent decoupling , U.S. firms could forego about $ 23 billion in revenue , $ 4 billion in R & D investments , almost 30,000 industry jobs , and almost 170,000 downstream jobs . Under an Entity List scenario , U.S. firms could still forego about $ 9 billion in revenue , $ 2 billion in R & D investments , over 10,000 industry jobs , and almost 70,000 downstream jobs .

Advanced chips represent the backbone of modern ICT infrastructure , powering everything from data centers and cloud computing platforms to AI systems and high-performance computing applications . Indeed , as an ITIF report estimates , an average data center relies on approximately 340,000 semiconductors to function . [ 34 ] These chips enable efficiency in processing speed , energy efficiency , and data handling capabilities , which are essential for the evolving demands of the digital economy . However , in the consistently evolving ICT sector , which requires greater efficiency every day , the U.S. semiconductor industry needs to consistently innovate and develop the next generation of chips in order to keep up with customer demand . As this report explains , the U.S. semiconductor industry ’ s ability to innovate could be hindered due to export controls or decoupling with China by depriving the industry of the revenues necessary to finance the R & D needed to produce the next generation of innovative chips . Corroborating this , a BCG study estimates that a technology decoupling between the U.S. semiconductor industry and China would lead to a decline of $ 12 billion , or 30 percent , in R & D investment . [ 35 ] While other countries ’ semiconductor firms could eventually supply advanced chips , it would take significant time for them to catch up to the already sophisticated designs and capabilities of U.S. firms . [ 36 ] During that period , U.S. industries would face higher costs , limited access to cutting-edge technology , and reduced competitiveness . Below are five examples of ICT industries that would be negatively affected by decreasing R & D in the semiconductor industry : 1 . Cloud computing and data centers . Cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services , Microsoft Azure , and Google Cloud rely on high-performance chips to run large-scale data centers efficiently . Less-efficient semiconductors increase energy costs and reduce processing speed , limiting the ability to offer faster , cheaper , and more scalable cloud services . 2 . AI and machine learning . AI systems , including natural language processing and computer vision , require advanced GPUs and AI accelerators . Slower or less-efficient chips reduce the speed of model training and inference , thereby constraining innovation and the adoption of AI tools across various industries . 3 . Telecommunications and 5G networks . Next-generation 5G infrastructure depends on powerful chips to handle massive amounts of data with low latency . Reduced chip performance can slow network deployment , limit bandwidth , and degrade service quality for consumers and enterprises . Although national security concerns are very important , strategic approaches that balance these concerns with the need for technological advancement are essential to sustain the U.S. ICT sector ’ s leadership in the global market . 4 . Enterprise software and high-performance computing ( HPC ) . Applications such as financial modeling , scientific simulations , and big data analytics rely on fast , energy-efficient processors . Less-capable semiconductors increase computation time and costs , lowering productivity and innovation potential for these industries . 5 . Consumer electronics and smart devices . Smartphones , laptops , smart home devices , and wearables depend on efficient semiconductors for battery life , speed , and advanced features . Reduced R & D in next-generation chips could delay product innovation , increase costs , and make U.S. products less competitive globally . The U.S. ICT sector ’ s reliance on advanced semiconductor technology necessitates continuous investment in R & D . Export controls and other measures that restrict market access could impede the development of next-generation chips , potentially hindering the growth and competitiveness of this critical industry . Policymakers should consider the long-term implications of such policies on semiconductor innovation and the broader digital economy . Although national security concerns are very important , strategic approaches that balance these concerns with the need for technological advancement are essential to sustain the U.S. ICT sector ’ s leadership in the global market . U.S. semiconductor export controls or broader decoupling from China would weaken the U.S. semiconductor industry and the wider economy . Limiting market access would reduce revenue for U.S. chipmakers , which would directly constrain their ability to fund R & D . Reduced R & D activity would hinder the creation of next-generation semiconductors , technologies that power critical ICT sectors such as cloud computing , AI , telecommunications , and high-performance computing . Reduced innovation in semiconductors cascades through these downstream industries , slowing technological advancement and weakening the global competitiveness of U.S. ICT firms . Lower revenue in the semiconductor industry would also force U.S. semiconductor companies to cut jobs , as they would be unable to maintain the same workforce without sufficient financial resources . Since each semiconductor job supports additional employment across the economy , the contraction in industry jobs would also reduce broader U.S. employment and economic activity . The U.S. semiconductor industry needs to continue to maintain its share of the Chinese semiconductor market in order to sustain ongoing R & D investment , which helps it maintain leadership in the industry and enables the United States to maintain its leadership in the digital economy . As such , U.S. policymakers should keep semiconductor export controls to a minimum in order to enable U.S. semiconductor firms to obtain high levels of revenue to invest in R & D . To estimate the impact of export controls or a decoupling with China on U.S. semiconductor companies , ITIF first obtained the revenue of the global semiconductor market in 2024 ; China ’ s aggregate global demand and its market share ; U.S. semiconductor firms ’ share of and revenue from the Chinese market ; U.S. semiconductor firms ’ global market share and revenue ; and Chinese semiconductor firms ’ global share and revenue for our baseline assumptions . ( See table 8 . ) These values come from SIA ’ s publications . Table 8 : Economic model ’ s key variables and descriptions Variable Description Global semiconductor market Size of the global semiconductor market China ’ s demand of global market China ’ s portion of global demand U.S. firms ’ share of China market Estimated share of China ’ s market held by U.S. firms U.S. firms ’ global market share U.S. semiconductor firms ’ global market share Chinese firms ’ global market share Chinese semiconductor firms ’ global market share Using SIA ’ s 2025 Factbook , ITIF then obtained global semiconductor sales by type of product ( e.g. , logic , memory , etc . ) . [ 37 ] We then estimated the total global semiconductor market for each type of semiconductor product . Assuming that the Chinese market demands the same share of each type of semiconductor product , China ’ s demand for each type of product in the global semiconductor market was estimated . Using U.S. semiconductor firms ’ share of China ’ s market , ITIF also estimated U.S. firms ’ revenue from the Chinese market for each type of product . These estimates were done for four different decoupling or export control scenarios : full decoupling ( 100 percent reduction in Chinese market access to U.S. semi ) , 50 percent decoupling ( 50 percent reduction ) , 25 percent decoupling ( 25 percent reduction ) , and Entity List ( assuming Entity List only reduces U.S. semiconductor revenue from the Chinese market by 10 percent ) . ( See table 9 . ) To simplify the analysis , ITIF assumed that U.S. firms have the same proportion of the Chinese market for all product types ( though , obviously , this varies ) . Table 9 : Economic model ’ s decoupling scenarios and U.S. firms ’ share loss of Chinese market Decoupling Scenario U.S. Firms ’ Share of Chinese Market Losses Full decoupling 100 percent loss of revenue from the Chinese market Considerable decoupling 50 percent loss of revenue from the Chinese market Partial decoupling 25 percent loss of revenue from the Chinese market Entity List 10 percent loss of revenue from the Chinese market Next , ITIF used data from BCG and SIA ’ s “ Emerging Resilience in the Semiconductor Supply Chain ” report to obtain the global semiconductor market share that China , the EU , Japan , Taiwan , South Korea , the United States , and others hold for each semiconductor product type . [ 38 ] Logic semiconductor product types include general purpose logic chips , microprocessor unit chips ( MPUs ) , microcontroller unit chips ( MCUs ) , and digital signal processor chips ( DSPs ) . Memory semiconductor product types only include memory chips . Discrete , analog , and optoelectronics ( DAO ) semiconductor product types include analog chips , optoelectronic ( opto ) , discretes , and sensors . ( See table 10 . ) With these observations , ITIF reduced the United States ’ share and scaled the remaining nation ’ s share proportionally to 100 percent . In other words , the remaining nations are assumed to have taken over the United States ’ shares based on their starting proportions ( not including the United States ) . Table 10 : Semiconductor product categories and product types for each category Logic Memory DAO ▪ General purpose logic chips ▪ Microprocessor units ▪ Microcontroller units ▪ Digital signal processor chips ▪ Memory chips ▪ Analog chips ▪ Optoelectronic chips ▪ Discretes ▪ Sensors Using the scaled shares of the remaining nations ( not including the United States ) and the U.S. firms ’ revenue from China ’ s market for each type of product , ITIF obtained the redistribution of the U.S. firms ’ revenue from China ’ s market to these remaining nations for each product type . This process was completed for each decoupling scenario . To estimate the impact of U.S. semiconductor firms ’ revenue losses on R & D investments for the four decoupling scenarios , ITIF first obtained the share of sales invested in R & D for U.S. firms and their corresponding value in 2024 . Then , for each decoupling scenario , ITIF subtracted the U.S. semiconductor firms ’ revenue loss from the 2024 U.S. semiconductor industry ’ s revenue before taking the share of sales invested in R & D for U.S. firms . We then subtracted this value from U.S. semiconductor firms ’ original R & D spending in 2024 to obtain the potential foregone R & D investment . To estimate the impact of U.S. semiconductor firms ’ revenue losses on the semiconductor industry jobs , ITIF first obtained the total number of semiconductor industry employees in 2024 . Then U.S. firms ’ revenue per employee was used to estimate job losses . Since it was not possible to determine the elasticity of demand for semiconductor firm ’ s employees , this model assumes a linear relationship between chipmakers ’ employment demand and revenues . ITIF first obtained the U.S. semiconductor firms ’ revenue per employee by dividing the U.S. semiconductor firms ’ global revenue by the number of employees . Next , the U.S. semiconductor firms ’ revenue loss for each decoupling scenario was divided by the U.S. semiconductor firms ’ revenue per employee to obtain the number of employees foregone from the decline in revenue . To assess the impact of U.S. semiconductor firms ’ revenue loss on non-semiconductor industry jobs , ITIF first determined the semiconductor job multiplier in 2024 , which was estimated to be 5.7 . [ 39 ] This means every job in the semiconductor industry generated 5.7 additional jobs in the U.S. economy . Next , the number of foregone semiconductor jobs was multiplied by 5.7 to determine the number of foregone downstream jobs . To estimate U.S. semiconductor firms ’ revenue foregone from decoupling with China after 5 and 10 years , ITIF first estimated the average annual growth rate of U.S. semiconductor firms ’ revenue from the Chinese market from 2020 to 2024 . Then , for each decoupling scenario , ITIF took U.S. semiconductor firms ’ losses for each semiconductor product and multiplied it by ( 1 + the average annual growth rate ) raised to the power of 5 or 10 ( years ) to determine the U.S. semiconductor firms ’ foregone revenues 5 and 10 years after decoupling . Moreover , the U.S. semiconductor firms ’ losses that were shifted to other nations were also multiplied by the average annual growth rate to estimate how much each nation gained after 5 and 10 years from U.S. semiconductor firms ’ losses from decoupling in the base year . This was done for each decoupling scenario and each semiconductor type . To determine U.S. semiconductor firms ’ foregone R & D investments , ITIF first estimated the average annual share of sales invested in R & D ( i.e. , R & D intensity ) by U.S. semiconductor firms from 2015 to 2024 . The rate was then multiplied by U.S. semiconductor firms ’ foregone revenue after 5 and 10 years for each decoupling scenario . To estimate the foregone semiconductor jobs from decoupling in the base year , ITIF first estimated the average annual growth rate from 2015 to 2024 for U.S. semiconductor jobs . Then the number of jobs lost after decoupling in the base year was multiplied by ( 1 + the average annual growth rate ) . This was done for each decoupling scenario . To determine the additional jobs in the economy foregone , ITIF multiplied these values by the job multiplier ( 5.7 ) . This was done for each decoupling scenario . To estimate the impact of decoupling after 5 and 10 years , ITIF first obtained the average annual growth rate for the global semiconductor market from 2005 to 2024 and U.S. firms ’ revenue from China ’ s market from 2020 to 2024 . ITIF also obtained the average China market demand of the global market , U.S. firms ’ global market share , and Chinese firms ’ global market share from 2015 to 2024 . Using the growth rates , ITIF first estimated the new global semiconductor market after 5 and 10 years . It was then assumed that China ’ s demand of the global market would continue to be the average of its last 10 years . Next , the new demand was multiplied by the new global semiconductor market value to determine the revenue from China ’ s demand of the global market . Then , ITIF estimated U.S. semiconductor firms ’ share of and revenue from China ’ s market for each decoupling scenario after 5 and 10 years . To do so , U.S. semiconductor firms ’ losses for each decoupling scenario were first subtracted from the U.S. semiconductor firms ’ revenue from the China market in Year 0 before decoupling to determine the remaining Chinese market that U.S. semiconductor firms retained after decoupling in Year 0 . That value was then multiplied by ( 1 + the annual average growth rate of U.S. firms ’ revenue from the China market ) for 5 or 10 years after decoupling to determine the new revenue from the Chinese market for U.S. firms . These values were divided by China ’ s demand of the global market to determine U.S. semiconductor firms ’ share of China ’ s market . Next , the U.S. semiconductor firms ’ global market share was estimated . To do so , the average U.S. firms ’ market share in the last 10 years was first multiplied by the global semiconductor market to determine U.S. firms ’ new global revenue . With that value , ITIF subtracted U.S. semiconductor firms ’ losses for each decoupling scenario in Year 0 multiplied by ( 1 + the average annual growth rate of U.S. firms ’ revenue from the China market ) raised to 5 or 10 ( years ) . These values were divided by the total global semiconductor market to determine U.S. semiconductor firms ’ market share . ITIF also estimated China ’ s market share 5 and 10 years after decoupling . To calculate this , the average Chinese firm ’ s market share over the last 10 years was first multiplied by the global semiconductor revenue to determine the new global revenue of Chinese firms . With that value , ITIF added the U.S. semiconductor firms ’ losses that were gained by Chinese firms for each decoupling scenario in Year 0 multiplied by ( 1 + the average annual growth rate of U.S. firms ’ revenue from the China market ) raised to 5 or 10 ( years ) . Then , these values were divided by the total global semiconductor market to determine Chinese firms ’ market share . To estimate the impact of decoupling with China on U.S. semiconductor firms ’ R & D spending , ITIF first estimated the average annual share of sales spent on R & D by U.S. semiconductor firms from 2015 to 2024 . That average was then multiplied by the new U.S. global market share to determine U.S. firms ’ new R & D amount 5 and 10 years after an initial decoupling . This was done for each decoupling scenario . To estimate the impact of decoupling with China on U.S. semiconductor industry jobs , ITIF first estimated the average annual growth rate from 2015 to 2024 for U.S. semiconductor firms ’ total employees . Next , the total number of U.S. semiconductor firms ’ employees in year 0 after decoupling was estimated by subtracting U.S. semiconductor firms ’ job losses from each decoupling scenario from the U.S. semiconductor firms ’ total employees before decoupling in year 0 . These values were then multiplied by ( 1 + the average annual growth rate ) raised to the power of 5 or 10 ( years ) to determine the new number of semiconductor industry employees 5 and 10 years after an initial decoupling . To estimate the additional jobs created 5 and 10 years after an initial decoupling , ITIF first assumed the job multiplier did not change . Then , the new number of semiconductor industry employees 5 and 10 years after decoupling was multiplied by the job multiplier for each decoupling scenario .

US,itif.org,news,2019-03-28,Backfire: Export Controls Helped Huawei and Hurt U.S. Firms,"Huawei is a more innovative company today than it was before the U.S. government sought to choke its supply chain. This case should serve as a lesson: U.S. techno-economic power is weaker than most think, and sanctions often hurt U.S. competitiveness more than China’s. Contents Key Takeaways 1 Introduction . 2 Huawei 101: Its Businesses and U.S. Actions Against the Company 4 How Huawei Bounced Back From Export Controls 12 How Export Controls On Huawei Are Affecting U.S. Companies 22 Why This Matters 27 Policy Recommendations 27 Conclusions 29 Endnotes 30 Does the United States have the power to kill Chinese companies? And can it do so without reducing its own techno-economic power? At least regarding Huawei, the answer to both questions is a definite no. Due to cybersecurity concerns, since 2018, the U.S. government has gradually banned the sale of Huawei products for U.S. telecommunications networks and encouraged other nations to do the same. But that was not enough for U.S. policymakers; they sought to kill the company. In 2019, the U.S. government sanctioned Huawei for doing business with adversaries, such as Iran, by taking judicial actions and adding the company to the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) Entity List—attempting to cripple Huawei by disrupting its supply chain. Both the Biden and the second Trump administration have continued to sanction the company. The export controls backfired. Huawei is the world’s largest telecom equipment manufacturer, and its global market share for telecom equipment increased from 29 percent in early 2018 to 31 percent by 2024. [1] At the same time, U.S. technology companies such as Intel, Qualcomm, Teradyne, and others lost more than $33 billion in sales to Huawei between 2021 and 2024—in a conservative estimate—weakening these American companies globally while strengthening Chinese or other nations’ tech companies, including Japan. Additionally, due to the restrictions, Huawei launched its OS, HarmonyOS, in 2019, which now has nearly a billion users and is compatible with mobiles, tablets, and laptops—a direct threat to Google’s Android and Microsoft’s Windows’ global market share. [2] The company is also catching up on chipmaking, claiming that in 2023 it was able to replace more than 13,000 components and redesign over 4,000 different circuit boards. [3] It is also reported that Huawei can substitute Nvidia’s H20 chip, a specific model that meets the U.S. government’s requirements for exporting semiconductors to China—limiting Nvidia’s global sales. [4] As of August 2025, Huawei claimed to have built an entire ecosystem independent of U.S. technologies. [5] Huawei was able to do this because it anticipated these U.S. actions as early as 2012 and invested heavily to offset them. [6] The company’s research and development (R&D) investments grew proportionally more than those of any other major technology company—including Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft—and it increased its reliance on the Chinese market to sustain revenues. In addition, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) provided significant financial support to the company to decouple from the United States after the restrictions were in place. Sanctioning Huawei and attempting to cripple the company has proven to be hubristic and self-defeating—U.S. techno-economic power is weaker than decision-makers in Washington might think. This should be a wake-up call for U.S. policymakers. It’s possible the U.S. government might have been able to cripple Huawei in the late 2000s or early 2010s when its and China’s technological capabilities were significantly weaker. But by the late 2010s, it was too late. As a result, the only outcome was to weaken U.S. technology companies and strengthen Huawei and China’s innovation. Sanctioning Huawei and attempting to cripple the company has proven to be hubristic and self-defeating—U.S. techno-economic power is now weaker than decision-makers in Washington might think. To the extent Huawei poses a cybersecurity threat, excluding it from U.S. networks and urging allies and trade partners to follow suit should have been the sole focus. However, the U.S. government sought to punish Huawei for allegations of doing business with Iran without fully considering the extent of this measure’s cost to U.S. companies and for American techno-economic power. Moreover, the U.S. government’s attempt to cripple Huawei underestimated the extent of the Chinese government’s support for the company, Huawei’s technological advancements, and its ability to source non-U.S. inputs or develop them domestically. The U.S. government’s approach was outdated, not reflecting the current relative power of the United States. This report shows how export controls accelerated Huawei’s innovations and harmed American companies. It first describes the U.S. actions against the company and how the current context differs from the U.S.-Japan technological rivalry of the 1980s, the last time the United States tried to stop the growth of a competitor. The report also provides a brief overview of Huawei’s businesses and its innovations after the export control measures. It then examines how the company overcame the restrictions by receiving support from the PRC and by preparing to offset the measures for over six years. In addition, it highlights how U.S. firms have been directly affected, with lost sales of over $33 billion between 2021 and 2024, and exposure to retaliation by the Chinese government due to these export controls. The report also explains why this backlash against U.S. companies matters in the context of U.S.-China techno-economic competition. Finally, the report proposes a framework to address the global rise of Chinese technology companies: ▪ The United States should press more countries to ban Huawei’s imports. ▪ Export controls should be applied jointly with allies, or not at all. ▪ Export control measures must consider impacts on U.S. firms and techno-economic power. Huawei is a privately owned company headquartered in Shenzhen, China, with close ties to the Chinese government, and is one of the world’s largest technology companies. [7] The firm reported revenues of $124 billion in 2024, of which information and communication technologies (ICT) infrastructure accounted for 43 percent, and consumer markets (e.g., smartphones, laptops, wearables, and tablets) accounted for 39 percent. [8] Other areas of the company’s business include smart grids and energy storage technologies, cloud computing, and smart automotive solutions. Starting around 2018, U.S. policymakers viewed the growing presence of Huawei within 5G networks as a cybersecurity threat. Policymakers argued that Huawei’s technologies could enable the Chinese government to conduct espionage through backdoors. [9] To address this concern, the U.S. government imposed a de facto import ban on Huawei through a patchwork of measures. (See table 1.) In addition, the global expansion of the company within 5G networks was also assessed as a cybersecurity concern, prompting the government to launch a diplomatic campaign to urge allies and trade partners to follow suit. [10] Table 1. De facto import bans—actions to exclude Huawei from U.S. 5G networks (2017 to present). [11] Date Measure Instrument December 2017 Prohibition by the U.S. Department of Defense from purchasing products from Huawei or ZTE for covered missions. National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2018 May 2018 Ban on retail sales of phones and other telecommunication devices from Huawei and ZTE within U.S. military facilities. U.S. Department of Defense ruling August 2018 Prohibition of all federal procurements from Huawei and ZTE. Additionally, it extended the ban to federal grants, loans, and subsidies, thereby broadening the impact of the restriction to most local government entities. NDAA for fiscal year 2019 May 2019 National emergency declaration due to alleged threats to the national telecommunications supply chain and authorization for the Department of Commerce to ban transactions from organizations considered “foreign adversaries.” Executive Order (EO) 13873 January 2020 Denial of transactions to purchase equipment from companies categorized as a national security threat to any recipient of federal telecommunications subsidies. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling March 2020 Total ban of telecommunication equipment or services that pose a national security risk, and a program to remove any such equipment and services currently used in U.S. networks. Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act of 2019 June 2020 Ban of Huawei and ZTE from receiving Universal Service Funds (USF), and force potential U.S. fund recipients to remove their equipment. FCC ruling January 2021 Establishment of a review process to potentially ban transactions from companies that pose a national security risk, including Huawei. 2021 Department of Commerce’s to enforcement of EO 13873 January 2021 Forcing of rural carriers to remove and replace Huawei equipment, offering reimbursement. FCC ruling November 2022 Prohibition of allowing Huawei telecom or surveillance equipment to enter the United States through the FCC’s Certification process or any other so-called “backdoors.” FCC ruling December 2024 Amendment and clarification of the January 2021 Department of Commerce’s interim ruling, closing backdoors that allowed Huawei, for example, to update software. Department of Commerce’s final rule implementing EO 13873 May 2025 Prohibition of Chinese labs deemed security risks from testing U.S. electronics. FCC ruling Despite these efforts, many allied countries and nations from the so-called Global South still use Huawei technologies for their 5G infrastructure. (See figure 1.) As of September 2025, over 3.2 billion people outside China resided in countries that use 5G networks that rely on Huawei equipment, while another 370 million live in countries where Huawei is not banned but is absent from their 5G networks. Huawei remains embedded in the 5G networks of nine U.S. allies—Hungary, Iceland, Italy, South Korea, Spain, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Thailand, and Turkey—and is being phased out from six others: Belgium, France, Germany, Poland, Romania, and the United Kingdom. [12] Among the rest, Huawei’s 5G is banned in 12 countries, and 10 countries have excluded the company without the need for a ban. [13] Figure 1. Prevalence of Huawei technologies in 5G infrastructure outside China [14] In early 2019, Huawei’s alleged business with the Iranian regime, and to a lesser extent with the North Korean regime, led the U.S. government to take action to penalize the company. The efforts taken to punish Huawei caused the U.S. government to lose focus on strengthening America’s power in the context of its techno-economic competition with China. As this report describes in further sections, these actions ultimately weakened U.S. competitiveness by hurting American companies. The U.S. government started judicial and administrative actions to sanction Huawei: ▪ Judicial actions. In January 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed indictments against Huawei and its CFO, Wanzhou Meng, the daughter of the founder, Ren Zhengfei, for bank fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy, and obstruction of justice. [15] Meng’s case was dismissed with prejudice in 2022. [16] The broader criminal case against Huawei is expected to begin in early 2026, which also includes allegations of its business dealings with the North Korean government. [17] ▪ Administrative actions. The U.S. Department of Commerce’s BIS announced the inclusion of Huawei and its subsidiaries on the Entity List in May 2019, arguing that the company “has been involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.” [18] The specific accusation that led to its inclusion on the Entity List was evasion of sanctions by doing business with the Iranian government. The Entity List is an executive tool used to target foreign individuals and organizations, subject to specific license requirements for the transaction of certain goods. [19] U.S. companies had a significant role in Huawei’s supply chain by the time it was included on the Entity List, and U.S. government officials attempted to “kill” or “cripple” the company using this as leverage. [20] By 2019, American companies accounted for one-third of Huawei’s expenses, with U.S. firms comprising 33 of its top 92 vendor suppliers. [21] These companies provided essential inputs to Huawei, such as chipsets used in headsets and telecommunications networks, equipment, electronic components, OSs, and semiconductor design software. [22] However, the U.S. government underestimated the Chinese government’s support for Huawei and the company’s innovation capabilities to overcome the attempts to damage its supply chain critically. The U.S. government attempted to cripple Huawei by enforcing Entity List-based export controls. The inclusion on the Entity List means a ban on any sale or transfer of U.S. technologies without a license from BIS, including R&D collaboration. The requirement for a license is extended to the export and re-export of all products subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), and all applications for licenses are under a “presumption of denial,” meaning the unlikelihood of obtaining exceptions. For Huawei, its inclusion on the Entity List meant that critical inputs from U.S.-based companies would no longer be available, including hardware for its smartphones and other products, as well as software, such as Google Mobile Services. Huawei enjoyed approximately a year and a half of limited breathing room to navigate the 2019 export controls until August 2020. The restrictions that took immediate effect after its inclusion in the Entity List applied to goods subject to the EAR—U.S.-made products and certain foreign goods manufactured using significant U.S. content. In May 2020, BIS expanded the jurisdiction for export controls on foreign-made chips fabricated with U.S. equipment (i.e., expansion of the Foreign-Produced Direct Product Rule), explicitly citing HiSilicon, a semiconductor subsidiary, as an example of Huawei’s affiliates targeted by these restrictions. [23] Moreover, following the company’s inclusion on the Entity List, BIS issued successive 90-day temporary general licenses (TGLs) that allowed Huawei to continue obtaining certain U.S. technologies, such as software updates. [24] An August 2020 amendment stopped the TGLs and tightened the Foreign-Produced Direct Product Rule, including foreign-made chips fabricated “from U.S. technology or software to support the manufacture of indigenous chipsets,” effectively limiting the company’s access to the world’s most advanced chips produced by the Taiwanese firm TSMC. [25] The restrictions after August 2020 included some exceptions, as BIS introduced a permanent authorization for “cybersecurity research and vulnerability disclosure.” For instance, in November 2020, Qualcomm and Intel announced that the U.S. government had granted licenses to sell a limited number of products, including 4G technology for mobile devices; these licenses were later revoked in May 2024. [26] Microsoft received a license allowing it to include Windows in Huawei’s laptops, which expired in March 2025. [27] Additionally, in September 2022, BIS granted a permanent authorization to collaborate with Huawei and its subsidiaries on standards setting and dialogue, aiming to prevent the fragmentation of international 5G and Wi-Fi protocols. [28] In 2022, the Biden administration announced export controls on advanced semiconductors and equipment to slow the Chinese semiconductor industry as a whole—i.e., not targeting specific companies. [29] These measures led some American companies to redesign some of their products to meet U.S. government standards. A notable example is Nvidia’s H20 chip, which is a second-tier version of its advanced data center chips designed to meet the 2022 restrictions. [30] The U.S. government later banned the export of the H20 chip in January 2025—which boosted Huawei's Ascend 910C chips in the Chinese market almost immediately—and later lifted the ban in July of that year. [31] Export Controls During the 1980s U.S.-Japan Technological Competition The United States was once able to halt the growth of entire industries that threatened American global leadership, such as the U.S.-Japan technology rivalry in the 1980s, particularly in the semiconductor sector. But the conditions that led the United States to stop the Japanese semiconductor industry’s growth do not apply to today’s U.S.-China techno-economic competition. The rapid rise of the Japanese economy during the 1980s was viewed as a threat by some U.S. policymakers. Japanese semiconductor, automotive, and consumer electronics companies were quickly gaining global market share, while Japan’s economy was largely inaccessible to American competitors. In 1985, the United States launched a Section 301 investigation—an instrument of the U.S. Trade Act used to impose trade remedies in response to unfair trade practices—against Japan’s semiconductor and electronics industries based on allegations of dumping and currency manipulation, leading to a 100 percent tariff on Japanese electronics. [32] Additionally, in 1986, both countries reached an agreement on semiconductors: Japan committed not to compete against the United States through dumping and allowed U.S. semiconductors to capture a 20 percent share of its domestic market. [33] Some experts consider these measures the “start of the decline for Japan’s semiconductor industry.” [34] Japan’s semiconductor industry grew rapidly during the 1980s, and it temporarily held the majority of the global market between 1986 and 1992. [35] (See figure 2.) The United States was able to regain its global market share through a mix of measures: addressing Japanese unfair trade practices, implementing industrial policies to support the American semiconductor industry, and capitalizing on shifts in global demand toward microprocessors and logic chips. A notable example of how the United States treated this as a public-private effort is the Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology (SEMATECH) consortium, created in 1987 by 14 U.S. semiconductor firms, which received $870 million from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). [36] An example of the United States sanctioning a specific Japanese company is the “Toshiba-Kongsberg scandal” in 1986, when it was revealed that Toshiba Machine, a subsidiary of the Japanese electronics manufacturer Toshiba Corporation, had sold sensitive technologies to the Soviet Union (USSR). [37] Toshiba’s tools, combined with those of the Norwegian weapons manufacturer Kongsberg—a company that was also supplying the USSR—were used to reduce the detection of nuclear submarines. [38] Toshiba Machine was sanctioned by the United States in 1988, which banned Toshiba Corp. and Toshiba Machine from public procurement, along with certain Toshiba Machine products, for three years. [39] Figure 2 : U.S. and Japanese global semiconductor market share, by revenues, 1984–2019 [40] The context and effectiveness of the U.S. government’s measures against Japanese companies in the 1980s differ from the ongoing U.S.-China techno-economic rivalry, as summarized in table 2. Table 2: Summary of the U.S.-Japan (1980s) vs. U.S.-China (present day) tech rivalry Context Similarities Differences Geopolitical Both represent contests between the United States and a rising economy. Japan was (and remains) a U.S. ally; China is a strategic rival. Japan cooperated; China retaliates and pushes decoupling. Trade Large bilateral trade deficits drove/drive tensions. Today’s globalized supply chains make restrictions harder to enforce and less effective. Industrial policy Semiconductors were and remain central to competition. The U.S. responded with industrial policies promoting the semiconductor industry (SEMATECH in 1987; CHIPS Act in 2022). U.S.–China rivalry spans more sectors, including advanced and military technologies. Japan’s security risks were product-specific, with few IP theft concerns; contrary to the current concerns about Chinese technology firms. Firm-level support Both relied/rely on “national champions” (Toshiba, Huawei) that benefited/benefit from state support and protected markets. Japanese firms are private conglomerates (keiretsu). Chinese firms are state-owned or closely tied to the CCP. Before the export controls, Huawei and its subsidiaries held a significant global market share in several of their businesses. Huawei has not fully recovered its revenues before the restrictions; however, the company has demonstrated resilience by regaining market share, mainly relying on the Chinese market. Some examples are listed below: ▪ Lower market share on smartphone shipments than before the export controls, but a higher participation in the Chinese market. The company had a 20 percent global market share in smartphone shipments by 2019, which dropped to “virtually zero” after the restrictions, although by December 2024, it had increased to 4 percent. [41] As of April 2025, Huawei was virtually tied with Xiaomi as the most popular mobile phone company in China, with approximately 18 percent market share. [42] ▪ Similar market share in ICT infrastructure before and after export controls. Huawei currently holds at least 31 percent of the global revenue for radio access network (RAN) products, slightly higher than its 30 percent market share in 2016. [43] ▪ Regaining market share in smartphone chipsets. The market share of smartphone chipsets from HiSilicon, Huawei’s semiconductor design subsidiary, peaked in the second quarter of 2020 at 16 percent, making it the third-largest supplier worldwide. However, it dropped to zero in the second quarter of 2022 and rebounded to 4 percent in the first quarter of 2025. [44] After its inclusion in the Entity List, Huawei is focusing on launching products that replace those previously supplied by U.S. companies. Notably, the company claims to have developed “an ecosystem entirely independent of the United States.” [45] One of the pillars of this independent ecosystem is Huawei’s in-house built OS, HarmonyOS, which was initially developed as a “backup plan” in case of U.S. restrictions; the company now expects it to become “a third mobile operating system for the world.” [46] HarmonyOS is also compatible with computers, and there are reports that Huawei is rolling out its laptops with this system instead of Microsoft’s Windows. [47] Huawei is focusing on launching products that replace those previously supplied by U.S. companies, and it claims to have developed “an ecosystem entirely independent of the United States.” Cutting off Android and Windows OS helped create and accelerate the deployment of Huawei’s OS. HarmonyOS runs on over 1 billion devices, and supports smartphones, laptops, tablets, and over 1,000 peripheral devices such as printers. [48] Huawei is exploring using HarmonyOS in other developments, such as microsatellites—and with its new generation, HarmonyOS NEXT, the firm expects to complete the decoupling from Western-led OSs. [49] According to Chinese media, HarmonyOS was developed with the collaboration of 20 research institutes and 10,000 engineers, and the effort has registered over 2,700 patents. Some Western companies operating in China, such as BMW, have already partnered with Huawei to incorporate its OS into their next-generation vehicles. [50] The effort to build an indigenous OS aligns closely with the PRC’s goals of technological self-reliance and challenges Western dominance in global markets. Android and Apple’s iOS account for nearly 99 percent of the worldwide smartphone market, and Apple, Google, and Microsoft together account for more than 90 percent of the laptop OSs’ share. [51] Moreover, OpenHarmony, the software upon which HarmonyOS is based, is managed by the OpenAtom Foundation, a Chinese government-controlled organization. [52] Huawei is also investing in reducing its reliance on foreign chipmaking technologies. The company claims that in 2023 it was able to replace more than 13,000 components and redesign over 4,000 circuit boards. [53] HiSilicon designed a 7 nanometer (nm) chip that compensates for its lower computing power by utilizing HarmonyOS and began deploying this chip in its devices in 2023. [54] Huawei’s AI chip, Ascend 910d, is expected to perform on par with Nvidia’s H100, one of the company’s most advanced products, yet at nearly 60–70 percent of its cost. [55] However, some reports estimate that Huawei lags significantly behind Western chipmakers, such as Nvidia and AMD, and will struggle to compete outside China. [56] Reports suggest that Huawei can substitute Nvidia’s H20 chip with the Ascend 920 model, announced in April 2025. [57] It is expected that Huawei will become China's top AI chipmaker by 2026, with the opening of three new plants. [58] Despite this, the company will not have the necessary scale to meet demand in the Chinese market within the next year. [59] In addition, Nvidia reported halting H20 chip production in August 2025 due to significant pushback from the Chinese government, and reports suggest that Chinese technology companies have been banned from acquiring it since September 2025 due to cybersecurity concerns. [60] The company is also opening new product lines, directly competing against U.S. firms. For example, Huawei’s smart driving solutions have been implemented in at least half a million cars, and some analysts suggest its technology is superior to Tesla’s. [61] The Huawei MateBook X Pro and Huawei’s Watch D also offer features and specifications that are often considered equal to or superior to those of Western competitors. [62] The export controls did not take into account the Chinese government’s efforts to secure the company’s survival. There is precedent for the Chinese government intervening to rescue the company. Ren Zhengfei, Huawei’s founder and president, stated that “Huawei would no longer exist” without protectionist policies to shield it from foreign competitors during its internationalization efforts in the 2000s. [63] At that time, Chinese-backed loans, such as those from the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China, aided Huawei’s international expansion, allowing the company to outbid competitors and adopt a “vacuum-cleaner approach … just sucking up the market.” [64] Over the 2010s, Huawei and state-owned ZTE artificially gained market share from Ericsson and Nokia in telecommunications equipment through direct support from the Chinese government, as well as indirect support such as restricting foreign companies’ access to the expanding Chinese market. [65] Following the U.S. export controls in 2019, Huawei continues to receive support from the PRC through financial support, direct procurement from state-owned Chinese companies, and a continued preferential treatment as a “national champion” for strategic national initiatives. Huawei’s success stands on the shoulders of Chinese innovation mercantilism. By 2019, Huawei had received $75 billion in state support since its establishment, including $1.6 billion in grants, $46.3 billion in credit facilities, $25 billion in tax breaks, and $2 billion in subsidized land purchases. [66] This helped the company gain market share, particularly in the global telecommunications equipment market. The company has also benefited from various other types of government support, including its role as a recipient of Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects, which helped the company expand its global footprint and build the necessary connections to navigate restrictions. [67] The Chinese government has implemented various practices to support Huawei and other national champions, including protecting the domestic market, undervaluing the currency, promoting exports, and ignoring intellectual property (IP) theft. [68] The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) has a longstanding record of reporting on how the PRC has subsidized Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications companies, such as ZTE. Huawei’s and ZTE’s global market share, primarily accumulated during the 2010s, was a direct result of China’s mercantilist policies and programs, such as closing China’s market to foreign companies, thereby securing a sizable customer base. [69] A 2020 ITIF study found that if Ericsson and Nokia had captured Huawei’s and ZTE’s equivalent market shares, the world would have seen a 20 percent increase in telecommunications equipment R&D investments and 75 additional essential 5G patents. [70] Hence, Chinese state support for Huawei not only helps advance China’s agenda of techno-economic dominance at the expense of Western incumbents, but also undermines overall global innovation. Following its inclusion in the Entity List in 2019, Huawei continues to receive support from the PRC. For example, the company has received more than 215 billion yuan ($30 billion) from the central and Shenzhen governments to acquire two chip plants and to build at least three others. [71] The PRC’s continued support is reflected in several additional ways: ▪ Favorable financial support to mitigate the effects of the export controls . HONOR, a former Huawei subsidiary, is a budget-brand smartphone whose business was heavily affected by U.S. restrictions, as it relied on U.S. semiconductors for its hardware and had access to the Google Play Store for its software. [72] HONOR was acquired in 2020 for 100 billion yuan ($15.2 billion) by a consortium of private and state-backed investors. [73] In this transaction, the Chinese government acted as the “investor of first resort,” allowing Huawei to divest from an asset subject to export controls under its ownership, while the PRC government secured the continuation of production for a company that, after the acquisition, was able to keep importing foreign chips. [74] ▪ Direct procurement from state-owned Chinese companies . The PRC has consistently favored China’s national champions through the procurement of public agencies or state-owned companies. For example, in 2021, China Mobile, a state-owned Chinese telecommunications company, announced that Huawei would be the vendor for 60 percent of 5G network station contracts. [75] (ZTE acquired nearly 30 percent, while Western competitors such as Ericsson and Nokia received the remaining few contracts.) China Mobile allocated Huawei 52 percent of a $1.1 billion contract for 5G network deployment between 2023 and 2024. [76] (Ericsson and Nokia received 13 percent of the resources; notably, another Chinese state-owned company, Datang Mobile, received awards in addition to ZTE.) What ITIF stated in 2020 remains valid in 2025: “The only reason a non-Chinese firm is allowed to gain 5G market share is to continue the illusion of an open competitive market, and to give the Chinese government leverage over European governments that seek to limit Huawei deployment in Europe. If the EU threatens to take strong action against unfair Chinese practices, the Chinese government can retaliate by threatening to completely exclude European providers.” [77] ▪ Continued preferential treatment as a “national champion” for strategic national initiatives . Huawei has been one of the primary beneficiaries of China’s industrial policies aimed at promoting the country’s strategic industry upgrades. For instance, the 2023 expansion of the semiconductor R&D tax incentive served as a de facto subsidy for Huawei and HiSilicon (Huawei’s semiconductor design subsidiary), among others, since semiconductor R&D expenditure can yield up to a 220 percent deduction from the company’s taxable income. [78] In 2023, the PRC designated Huawei—along with Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment (AMEC), Naura, and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC)—as targets for increased governmental support for semiconductors, without requiring the demonstration of performance objectives. [79] (To be sure, semiconductor tax credits can be legitimate tools for nations to use to promote their semiconductor industries, so long as those tax credits are made available equally to companies from all countries competing in a nation’s market.) Since 2012, Huawei has shifted toward greater reliance on the Chinese domestic market to buffer against restrictions, invested heavily in R&D, developed capabilities to produce in-house critical hardware and software, and stockpiled resources to survive the first year after restrictions. ITIF noted in 2020 that export controls were “shooting U.S. exporters in the foot,” as they went beyond protecting the U.S. telecommunications networks for cybersecurity reasons, limited U.S. company exports, and incentivized Huawei “to produce its own inputs, including computer chips.” [81] This assessment proved to be accurate. Moreover, the export controls overlooked that Huawei had prepared for a restrictions scenario for over six years before the company was added to the Entity List in 2019. Notably, a 2012 U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence special report revealed the company’s unfair practices and its ties with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) acted as an early warning. [82] Since 2012, Huawei has shifted toward greater reliance on the Chinese domestic market to buffer against restrictions, invested heavily in R&D, developed capabilities to produce in-house critical hardware and software, and stockpiled resources to survive the first year after restrictions. A year after the 2012 House report, Huawei initiated an aggressive public relations campaign in the United States to improve its image. When the campaign did not lessen the scrutiny over the company’s practices and cybersecurity concerns, it officially declared that it was “not interested in the U.S. market anymore,” noting that its U.S. market sales were only $1 billion. [83] (This ignored the fact that the company relied heavily on U.S. technology components for all its operations.) While the 2000s were a decade of international expansion for Huawei, the company reversed this trend in the subsequent decade. Before the 2008 global financial crisis, Huawei’s global expansion led to a significant increase in its non-Chinese revenues, jumping from 21 percent in 2005 to 75 percent in 2008. As the shock from the crisis led the company to increase its share in Chinese markets by 15 percentage points from 2008 to 2009, Huawei slowly recovered its income from non-Chinese markets by 2011. However, since 2012, Huawei has significantly expanded its presence and increasingly relied on revenues from China. By 2019, China represented 59 percent of Huawei’s revenues, and in its latest 2024 annual report, China provided 71 percent of revenues. Figure 3: Huawei’s revenues from China as a share of total revenues [84] While revenues from China have increased in relative terms for the company since 2012, revenues from the rest of the world also rose in the years leading up to the U.S. restrictions. As shown in figure 4, Huawei’s global revenues increased 2.5 times between 2011 and 2020, the years when revenues peaked. However, revenues generated in China grew sixfold during this period, whereas revenues from non-Chinese markets rose by 78 percent. Revenues from China have served as a buffer to offset the impact of U.S. export controls. During the first year after them, revenues from China increased by 12 percent, offsetting the 14 percent decline in non-Chinese markets, which enabled Huawei to report an overall year-over-year increase. In the following years, revenues from China bounced back rapidly. Between 2019 and 2024, revenues from China increased by 4 percent, while revenues from non-Chinese markets declined by 7 percent. Figure 4: Huawei’s revenues by region (billion CNY, 2024 prices) [85] Revenues from China have served as a buffer to offset the impact of U.S. export controls. One example of how the Chinese market has served as a buffer is Huawei’s market share for smartphone devices. The company once dominated the Chinese smartphone market, accounting for 37 percent and 38 percent of total sales in 2019 and 2020, respectively. As the export controls affected the firm’s production, by 2021, this market share had fallen to approximately 5 percent. Considering that HONOR spun off from Huawei through the previously described state-supported acquisition, the comparison of post-restrictions market share should involve both companies. In this context, despite a challenging 2021, the combined market share of Huawei and HONOR in China averaged 29 percent for the 2022 to 2024 period. (See figure 5.) As of 2025, Huawei’s market share in this sector has virtually tied with Xiaomi, making it one of the two most dominant ICT companies in China. Figure 5: Huawei’s market share in China for smartphone sales [86] Huawei outperformed all its competitors in terms of R&D investment before the U.S. restrictions. Between 2013 (the first full year after the October 2012 House report on Huawei) and 2020, Huawei increased its real R&D expenditure by more than threefold, surpassing that of any other peer company, as shown in figure 6. Regardless of whether this investment—which exceeded that of the rest of the industry—was motivated by global expansion or by the fact that Huawei executives were indeed accounting for restrictions risks, in practice, these years of R&D overspending allowed the company to build a knowledge base to confront the restrictions challenge. Figure 6: Real R&D expenditure growth by company (indexed; 2013 = 100) [87] Growth in Huawei’s R&D expenditures declined after the restrictions, yet it still set a record for the company in 2023 and 2024. [88] Huawei’s efforts to develop (or catch up with) frontier technologies have not diminished. One way to approximate this is by examining R&D intensity, which considers the company’s R&D expenditure as a share of total revenues for a given year. Huawei had historically lagged behind in corporate R&D compared to competitors such as Ericsson and Nokia. [89] However, as figure 7 shows, U.S. restrictions forced the company to increase its R&D intensity to an average of 20 percent between 2019 and 2023, outperforming all competitors except Intel (which competes with Huawei only in one of Huawei’s businesses: semiconductors). Figure 7: R&D intensity by company (R&D expenditure as a share of net sales) [90] Huawei took advantage of the TGL granted after its designation to the Entity List to release HarmonyOS. Additionally, Huawei increased its number of R&D personnel since the U.S. restrictions were imposed, hiring more than 17,000 employees in this field between 2019 and 2024. (See figure 8.) While Huawei’s R&D staff accounted for 45 percent of the total staff count during the five years preceding the restrictions (2014–2018), this proportion rose to an average of 55 percent in the five years following the U.S. inclusion of the company on the Entity List (2020–2024). There is no available information about the specific units or research projects to which these additional R&D researchers have been assigned. Figure 8: Number of R&D employees and R&D personnel as a share of total employees for Huawei [91] The export control for software, in practice, began in August 2020 after BIS stopped granting the TGL. [92] This meant that Huawei would lose access to all non-open-source dealings, such as licensing for Google’s Android OS, Google’s Play Store app ecosystem, and any other software-related business with U.S.-headquartered companies. Huawei sold its handsets with Android Open Source Project in China (since Google’s services were blocked in the country due to censorship) and the Google-certified Android OS for the rest of the world as the integrated OS. Microsoft enjoyed a license until March 2025, allowing it to include Windows OS in Huawei’s laptops. [93] Huawei took advantage of the TGL granted after its designation to the Entity List to release HarmonyOS in August 2019. The company had previously explored using another OS instead of Android, such as Microsoft’s Windows Phone OS or Samsung’s Tizen in 2014. [94] Huawei explicitly built its in-house OS in anticipation of potential U.S. restrictions—two months before the restrictions, a spokesperson stated, “Huawei does have backup systems but only for use in extenuating circumstances.” [95] Some reports indicate that the company has been prepared for “worst-case scenarios” since the 2012 House report. [96] Evidence suggests that the firm was preparing for an indigenous OS as early as 2013–2014. For example, LiteOS, an OS for real-time Internet-of-Things devices, was launched in 2015. [97] Some of the functions of LiteOS used to build HarmonyOS and its open-source version, OpenHarmony, are described as its direct predecessors. [98] Similarly, the technology enabling cross-device tasks and efficient resource allocation scheduling for the OS patent application dates back to May 2015, suggesting that at least part of the research was conducted in 2014 or earlier. [99] Huawei developed semiconductor capabilities to achieve self-sufficiency in the event of U.S. restrictions. To achieve this goal, the company took three clear actions: invested in its main chip design subsidiary (HiSilicon), began working with companies that have complementary strengths in the semiconductor supply chain, and created incentives to develop an ecosystem within China through an investment platform. HiSilicon, fully owned by and originating as a spin-off of Huawei in the 2000s, served as the cornerstone of Huawei’s backup plans for chips. The day after the export controls were announced in May 2019, HiSilicon’s CEO sent a letter warning that the company had been preparing a “spare tire” for the survival of Huawei. [100] HiSilicon provided Huawei with the organizational and staffing capabilities to develop physical components that could replace U.S. technologies. By 2012, HiSilicon had developed at least 120 chip designs and distributed at least 150 million chips. [101] HiSilicon has been developing chips branded as Kirin since 2014 and helped design the world’s first 7 nm chipset commercialized with 5G support, Kirin 980, in 2018 in partnership with TSMC. [102] HiSilicon produced more than $7 billion worth of chips during the period before the 2019 restrictions. [103] The second action taken was to collaborate with companies that have complementary capabilities. For example, in 2015, Huawei announced a joint venture with SMIC (a partially state-owned Chinese company), Imec (a Belgian research consortium), and Qualcomm (a U.S. semiconductor company) called SMIC Advanced Technology Research & Development (Shanghai) Corporation. This joint venture, majority owned by SMIC, focused on R&D to develop 14 nm semiconductor technology for mass production by 2020. [104] SMIC announced the start of volume production for the 14 nm chip in late 2019, and the first commercialization took place in 2020 with HiSilicon’s 14 nm Kirin 710A chip. [105] Finally, Huawei sought to build a local ecosystem of suppliers to strengthen China’s self-sufficiency in semiconductors. In 2019, before Huawei’s inclusion on the Entity List, the company launched Hubble, a venture capital subsidiary designed as an investment vehicle for semiconductor startups, with a registered capital exceeding $100 million. Before the establishment of Hubble, Huawei had maintained a practice of not investing in third-party companies. [106] To date, Hubble has invested in at least 100 startups. [107] For example, it is an investor in companies developing key semiconductor fabrication processes, such as Focuslight Technologies (a photolithography equipment maker), Suzhou Everbright Photonics (a gallium-nitride chipmaker), and Xuzhou Chemicals (which develops photoresist technologies used in lithography). [108] Hubble is currently being used to further promote Huawei’s ecosystem by funding startups that would be locked into it, for instance, by investing in humanoid robots that can integrate the company’s new developments in chips (Huawei’s Ascend AI chips), large language models (Pangu), and HarmonyOS. [109] The cumulative congressional and executive actions raising concerns about Huawei during late 2017 onward allowed the company to take actions to mitigate potential U.S. measures against it. For example, Huawei’s inventories of raw materials expanded by more than 86 percent from 2017 to 2018, and the company has kept a high level of stockpiles of raw materials since the restrictions relative to other inventories. (See figure 9.) These raw materials include electronic components and sub-assemblies used in manufacturing telecommunication equipment and consumer devices, as well as large orders of the 7 nm Tiangang core chips, manufactured by TSMC using U.S. wafer fabrication equipment and supplying Huawei until the end of the TGL. [110] These inventory levels allowed the company to effectively boost its revenues during the first year after it was added to the Entity List, in addition to other measures such as issuing bonds in the Chinese market for over $800 million to increase liquidity and reduce its financial reliance on foreign markets. [111] Figure 9: Huawei’s raw materials as a share of total inventories [112] The U.S. actions against Huawei served as an incentive for the company to accelerate its decoupling from U.S. technologies. U.S. exports to Huawei exceeded $11 billion when the firm was added to the Entity List. [113] Without those inputs, it created a “void” in Huawei’s supply chain that was mostly filled by Huawei’s in-house processes or Chinese technologies. Restrictions against the company harmed U.S. businesses by reducing sales of former Huawei suppliers and triggering retaliation from the PRC against them. ITIF estimates that restrictions on doing business with Huawei caused U.S. companies to lose at least $33 billion in sales between 2021 and 2024. This estimation is based on two main priors. Before U.S. restrictions, Huawei spent roughly 33 percent of its operating costs on American suppliers. [114] Following the August 2020 amendment to terminate the TGLs, BIS authorized a limited number of export licenses from 2021 to 2024; however, this information is not publicly available. [115] Anecdotal evidence suggests that Huawei purchased between 5 and 10 percent of its operating costs from U.S. firms during this period; ITIF conservatively estimates that share to be 15 percent. [116] To model what would have happened without the export controls, ITIF combined two different types of alternatives for Huawei, creating a total of four different estimations, summarized in figure 10. The first case involves trying to infer what Huawei’s growth would be without U.S. restrictions. To do this, ITIF modeled two scenarios: the “current sales” scenario (using existing data on Huawei’s performance) and a “no export controls scenario,” which assumes that Huawei’s sales would follow the same pattern as the average of its main Western competitors (Alphabet, Apple, Ericsson, Nokia, and Microsoft) from 2021–2024. The second consideration for Huawei in this analysis is whether the company was already on a path to decouple from U.S. technologies, regardless of U.S. actions. To explore this, ITIF modeled two cases: a base case wherein U.S. firms accounted for roughly 33 percent of Huawei’s operating costs for all years (business-as-usual suppliers, or “BAU suppliers,” scenario) and a “decoupling scenario,” assuming Huawei would fully decouple from U.S. technologies by 2027—the 100th anniversary of the PLA. Figure 10. Lost sales to U.S. suppliers due to export controls against Huawei between 2021 and 2024 (billions) [117] Sales from U.S. firms to Huawei helped sustain American market share in key technology products and funded R&D projects, preventing China from capturing that share. At the industry level, Huawei often did not represent a significant portion of the revenues of American advanced manufacturing companies. (See table 3.) However, these sales helped U.S. companies reach the necessary volumes and margins to invest in innovation, ultimately maintaining competitiveness and market share. Restrictions against Huawei directly harmed U.S. businesses by reducing sales of former Huawei suppliers and triggering retaliation from the PRC against them. The restrictions also had a secondary effect on American companies supplying Huawei. Many of them reported in their annual statements that U.S. action negatively impacted the overall demand for their products. For example, Analog Devices Inc., an American semiconductor company, reported in its 2020 annual report that restrictions were “causing our current or potential customers to amass large inventories of our products, replace our products with products from another supplier that is not subject to the export restrictions, or focus on building indigenous semiconductor capacity to reduce reliance on U.S. suppliers.” [118] Table 4: Examples of U.S. advanced manufacturing companies affected by the export controls [119] Company Example of What It Supplied to Huawei Relevant Financial Information Analog Devices Inc. Chips used in radio systems for 5G telecommunications networks Sales to Huawei represented between 2 and 3 percent of total sales by 2020. Broadcom Wireless communication chips for smartphones and other devices Huawei represented 4 percent of Broadcom’s revenues in 2019, or $900 million. Cadence Electronic design automation software (EDA), also provided to HiSilicon In May 2025, the U.S. government imposed new export controls on EDA sales to Chinese companies. Intel License to ship laptop central processors to Huawei in 2020 (revoked in 2024) When the 2024 license was revoked, Intel maintained its revenue expectation for the year, but “below the midpoint” between $12.5 billion and $13.5 billion. Micron Technology Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) Huawei represented 13 percent of revenues by February 2019. Qorvo Radio frequency (RF) supplier for Huawei handsets and base stations Huawei accounted for 13 percent of 2019 revenues, 10 percent in 2020, and 5 percent in 2021, after which it stopped reporting significant sales. Qualcomm License in 2020 to sell older 4G chips to Huawei (revoked in 2024) Between October 2023 and May 2024, revenues from Huawei represented $560 million (1.4 percent for the fiscal year ending in September 2024) Texas Instruments Analog chips for Huawei smartphones and telecom equipment Sales to Huawei represented between 3 and 4 percent of total sales in 2019. Giving Away Market Share to a Foreign Competitor: The Case of Teradyne Teradyne is an American manufacturing company specializing in Automated Test Equipment (ATE) for the semiconductor industry. ATE plays a critical role in semiconductor manufacturing, as it guarantees essential quality controls during the different stages of the process. Teradyne, along with its Japanese competitor Advantest, together account for roughly 80–90 percent of the global market for semiconductor testers in many segments. [120] Teradyne is also a global leader in advanced robotics through its subsidiary Universal Robots. [121] As the export controls against Huawei limited the supply of U.S. technologies to the firm, but were not coordinated with allies, Teradyne was impacted, but its Japanese competitor was not. Thus, Huawei replaced Teradyne’s inputs with Advantest’s, giving up global market share. [122] Advantest’s global market share for semiconductor testers grew from 43 percent in 2020 to 58 percent in 2024, while Teradyne’s declined roughly in a similar, inverse proportion. [123] The restrictions have also harmed Teradyne’s ability to keep investing in innovation capabilities. The company observed two consecutive years of revenue decline, from $3.7 billion in 2021 to $2.7 billion in 2023. As of September 2025, it had not recovered its pre-restriction sales. This revenue loss has impacted the firm’s innovation capabilities. Figure 11 shows the R&D expenditure for Advantest and Teradyne, indexed in 2020, when restrictions began. After the restrictions came into effect for ATE products, Advantest was able to expand its R&D expenditure by roughly 50 percent, while Teradyne observed a decrease in real R&D expenditure. Figure 11 . R&D expenditure (indexed; 2020 = 100). [124] U.S. restrictions also compelled American companies to cancel their contracts with Huawei, such as the earlier removal of Google’s Play Store from Huawei devices. This meant that Huawei’s wearables could not be updated to meet Google’s security and development standards. [125] A similar pattern occurred with Microsoft and its laptop OS, the Windows series. Windows’ license to Huawei expired in March 2025, giving the Chinese company enough time to incorporate HarmonyOS into its laptops. [126] After March 2025, reports indicate that Huawei is only rolling out laptops using its in-house-built OS, HarmonyOS, threatening Microsoft’s market share. [127] While there has not been a formal retaliation from the Chinese government against the United States due to Huawei’s inclusion on the Entity List, the PRC has since taken actions that effectively serve as a response to the restrictions. A few months after the restrictions were imposed in 2019, Cisco executives declared that the company was “uninvited” to compete in bids by Chinese state-owned companies. [128] Thus, Cisco was de facto barred from continuing to sell telecommunications infrastructure to Chinese carriers. (Cisco still sells equipment to other Chinese companies, such as electric vehicle makers.) [129] In December 2019, the PRC instructed all government agencies to phase out foreign-made technologies, including hardware and software, by 2022. [130] This measure was directly targeted at reducing the market share of American firms, such as Dell, HP, and Microsoft, while being functional to the PRC’s goal of technological self-sufficiency. Likewise, local governments in China, such as Shenzhen, started promoting the adoption of HarmonyOS as their primary system, under the “Shenzhen Action Plan for Supporting the Development of Native HarmonyOS Open Source Applications in 2024,” which is seen as a basis for a nation-wide initiative to phase out American OS. [131] In addition, the PRC established its version of the Entity List in May 2019, called the “Unreliable Entity List,” with a justification similar to that of the American version. [132] This tool provides the PRC with a legal basis to target retaliatory measures against specific companies, primarily American ones. The Unreliable Entity List uniquely includes American companies, and it has been utilized by the Chinese government as a “bargaining tool” during ongoing trade negotiations, highlighting the retaliatory nature of the measure. [133] The U.S.–China techno-economic rivalry plays out across every strategic sector, including those in which Huawei competes with American firms for global market share. As ITIF has reported, China is rapidly catching up with the United States in robotics, electronic displays, and artificial intelligence, and it lags behind in machine tools and semiconductors. [134] These are all critical links in Huawei’s supply chain. Because U.S. policy has shaped Huawei’s innovation path, its continued growth erodes America’s competitive edge. The business opportunity loss for American firms doing business with Huawei ultimately matters for the U.S. public interest for three reasons: 1. The acceleration of Huawei’s decoupling from using U.S. technologies impacts American global market share in key products, such as OSs. 2. The loss of revenues from doing business with Huawei undermines American competitiveness, as it limits U.S. firms’ ability to reinvest in R&D and advanced production. [135] 3. The acceleration of Huawei’s decoupling from U.S. technologies is leading to a lock-in of consumers to products within an ecosystem that privileges Chinese standards and supply chains. U.S. technology companies are now in a weaker position to lead globally due to Huawei’s accelerated decoupling. As Nokia and Ericsson were ultimately unable to offset the unfair competition against Huawei and ZTE in 5G, this pattern will likely repeat for the cases of HarmonyOS, the new generation of Huawei’s wearables competing against American firms, or both. The result is likely to be a decline in global market share for companies such as Google and Microsoft. The rationale used by the U.S. government’s actions against Huawei is a legacy of an earlier era, when America could impose sanctions without significantly harming its competitiveness and could hinder the production capabilities of its adversaries. This framework is outdated, as global supply chains have become increasingly complex and Chinese techno-economic power has reached, in some cases, unassailable levels. The United States needs a realistic approach. The fact that the United States is incapable of crippling a company such as Huawei does not preclude the need to take actions against Chinese mercantilism. A modern framework should pair import bans for cybersecurity reasons with limited, targeted export controls on advanced technologies. Some of the measures that U.S. policymakers should consider for this modern framework include the following: ▪ Press more countries to ban Huawei’s imports . In 2020, ITIF recommended that the U.S. government urge its allies to exclude Huawei and ZTE from their markets, particularly in the telecommunications network infrastructure and equipment sector, to counter the companies’ artificial competitiveness resulting from Chinese support and the lack of opportunities for rivals to access the Chinese domestic market. [136] This assessment has not changed. Despite foreign policy’s efforts across multiple U.S. administrations, Huawei remains in many European markets—even as its predatory practices have particularly harmed Ericsson and Nokia. Some allies are phasing out Huawei from their 5G network. Germany, for example, plans to phase out Huawei from core 5G networks by 2026 and from the radio and management layers by 2029. [137] However, nine U.S. allies—Hungary, Iceland, Italy, South Korea, Spain, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Thailand, and Turkey—continue to use Huawei in their 5G infrastructure without a plan to phase out the company entirely. The U.S. government needs to reverse course on its go-it-alone approach to competitiveness and start to bring in a “coalition of the willing” that understands the threat to the West from Chinese national power industry predation and is willing to take collective steps in self-defense. One such step should be to ban further sales of Huawei telecom equipment. A modern framework should pair import bans for cybersecurity reasons with limited, targeted export controls on advanced technologies. ▪ Export controls should be applied jointly with allies, or not at all. Export controls, in part, were ineffective because regulatory loopholes allowed Huawei to fully offset American inputs of the same cost and quality as those of U.S. allies, including Japan. As this report shows, blanket export controls on Huawei have undermined American competitiveness in markets where the company has other substitutes, such as the case of ATE for chipmaking tests. This experience demonstrates that unilateral export controls, besides being ineffective and harmful to U.S. companies, actually work to the advantage of American allies. ▪ Export control measures must consider impacts on U.S. firms and techno-economic power . For decades, U.S. foreign policy makers and mavens were willing to spend U.S. techno-economic power to achieve foreign policy goals, such as sanctioning a country we wanted to punish, such as Iran. America can no longer afford such spending of its “technology capital.” Huawei’s experience demonstrates that export controls are detrimental to the United States in both absolute and relative terms: they reduced the resources available for U.S. companies to invest in R&D and innovation, and helped shape Huawei as a competitor in new products, such as OSs, which now threaten U.S. dominance in this global market. It is time for an intellectual and operational reset. U.S. policymakers cannot assume that the United States maintains global leadership in advanced sectors. American competitiveness is faltering and requires a coordinated strategy, led by the federal government, to reverse this trend. The approach taken by the U.S. government against Huawei, with export controls to sanction the company and cripple it, was hubristic—and ultimately backfired. An import ban on Huawei’s 5G network in the United States, along with urging allies and trade partners to follow suit, would have addressed the cybersecurity concerns about the company. Yet, the measures went beyond. The U.S. government took actions against the company for its alleged business with adversaries, such as Iran, which turned out to be costly for U.S. firms and damaging to American competitiveness. It later tried to cripple the company, underestimating Huawei’s innovation capabilities and the PRC’s support. Moreover, as this report shows, a 2012 Congressional report denouncing the company’s predatory practices and cybersecurity risks served as an early warning that prompted the company to invest in decoupling from U.S. technologies. Huawei’s resiliency threatens American competitiveness and market share. After the implementation of export controls, the company has successfully launched its in-house OS, HarmonyOS, which is now being rolled out on mobile devices, tablets, and laptops—potentially threatening U.S. firms’ market share in these sectors. The company is also catching up in chipmaking and exploring new business lines, such as energy storage technologies and smart automotive solutions. Additionally, this report demonstrates how export restrictions harm U.S. companies, resulting in over $33 billion in lost sales and, in some cases, a relative reduction in R&D investments. The failure of U.S. policies against Huawei evidences an outdated rationale to address Chinese mercantilism. The current U.S.-China techno-economic competition differs significantly from earlier episodes when U.S. technological leadership was challenged. For example, the United States regained its semiconductor lead during the U.S.-Japan rivalry of the 1980s and today commands nearly five times Japan’s global market share. It succeeded by combining restrictions, diplomacy with an allied partner (Japan), and sustained innovation. None of those conditions applies today: Chinese support offsets restrictions, the rivalry is with an adversary rather than an ally, and China has caught up or even pulled ahead in many strategic technologies. In other words, the United States is using yesterday’s tools against a fundamentally different adversary; it needs a realistic, not hubristic, policy approach. Acknowledgments Huawei’s building “spare tires” in anticipation of U.S. sanctions is based on the company’s own statements, notably by Ren Zhengfei in 2019. However, the broader narrative of Huawei’s preparations for U.S. restrictions and the “spare tire” concept was first fully documented and gained broad attention through detailed reporting in Eva Dou’s book House of Huawei: The Secret History of China’s Most Powerful Company . “Backfire,” the title of this report, is also the title of one of Annabel Yao’s singles. Annabel Yao, a Chinese pop star and one of Ren Zhengfei’s daughters, is often referred to as the “Huawei Princess.” The author wishes to thank the following individuals for assisting with this report: Robert Atkinson, Daniel Castro, Eli Clemens, Randolph Court, and Stephen Ezell.

This case should serve as a lesson: U.S. techno-economic power is weaker than most think, and sanctions often hurt U.S. competitiveness more than China’s. Contents Key Takeaways 1 Introduction . 2 Huawei 101: Its Businesses and U.S. Actions Against the Company 4 How Huawei Bounced Back From Export Controls 12 How Export Controls On Huawei Are Affecting U.S. Companies 22 Why This Matters 27 Policy Recommendations 27 Conclusions 29 Endnotes 30 Does the United States have the power to kill Chinese companies? And can it do so without reducing its own techno-economic power? At least regarding Huawei, the answer to both questions is a definite no. Due to cybersecurity concerns, since 2018, the U.S. government has gradually banned the sale of Huawei products for U.S. telecommunications networks and encouraged other nations to do the same. But that was not enough for U.S. policymakers; they sought to kill the company. In 2019, the U.S. government sanctioned Huawei for doing business with adversaries, such as Iran, by taking judicial actions and adding the company to the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) Entity List—attempting to cripple Huawei by disrupting its supply chain. Both the Biden and the second Trump administration have continued to sanction the company. The export controls backfired. Huawei is the world’s largest telecom equipment manufacturer, and its global market share for telecom equipment increased from 29 percent in early 2018 to 31 percent by 2024. [1] At the same time, U.S. technology companies such as Intel, Qualcomm, Teradyne, and others lost more than $33 billion in sales to Huawei between 2021 and 2024—in a conservative estimate—weakening these American companies globally while strengthening Chinese or other nations’ tech companies, including Japan. Additionally, due to the restrictions, Huawei launched its OS, HarmonyOS, in 2019, which now has nearly a billion users and is compatible with mobiles, tablets, and laptops—a direct threat to Google’s Android and Microsoft’s Windows’ global market share. [2] The company is also catching up on chipmaking, claiming that in 2023 it was able to replace more than 13,000 components and redesign over 4,000 different circuit boards. [3] It is also reported that Huawei can substitute Nvidia’s H20 chip, a specific model that meets the U.S. government’s requirements for exporting semiconductors to China—limiting Nvidia’s global sales. [4] As of August 2025, Huawei claimed to have built an entire ecosystem independent of U.S. technologies. [5] Huawei was able to do this because it anticipated these U.S. actions as early as 2012 and invested heavily to offset them. [6] The company’s research and development (R&D) investments grew proportionally more than those of any other major technology company—including Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft—and it increased its reliance on the Chinese market to sustain revenues. In addition, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) provided significant financial support to the company to decouple from the United States after the restrictions were in place. Sanctioning Huawei and attempting to cripple the company has proven to be hubristic and self-defeating—U.S. techno-economic power is weaker than decision-makers in Washington might think. This should be a wake-up call for U.S. policymakers. It’s possible the U.S. government might have been able to cripple Huawei in the late 2000s or early 2010s when its and China’s technological capabilities were significantly weaker. But by the late 2010s, it was too late. As a result, the only outcome was to weaken U.S. technology companies and strengthen Huawei and China’s innovation. Sanctioning Huawei and attempting to cripple the company has proven to be hubristic and self-defeating—U.S. techno-economic power is now weaker than decision-makers in Washington might think. To the extent Huawei poses a cybersecurity threat, excluding it from U.S. networks and urging allies and trade partners to follow suit should have been the sole focus. However, the U.S. government sought to punish Huawei for allegations of doing business with Iran without fully considering the extent of this measure’s cost to U.S. companies and for American techno-economic power. Moreover, the U.S. government’s attempt to cripple Huawei underestimated the extent of the Chinese government’s support for the company, Huawei’s technological advancements, and its ability to source non-U.S. inputs or develop them domestically. The U.S. government’s approach was outdated, not reflecting the current relative power of the United States. This report shows how export controls accelerated Huawei’s innovations and harmed American companies. It first describes the U.S. actions against the company and how the current context differs from the U.S.-Japan technological rivalry of the 1980s, the last time the United States tried to stop the growth of a competitor. The report also provides a brief overview of Huawei’s businesses and its innovations after the export control measures. It then examines how the company overcame the restrictions by receiving support from the PRC and by preparing to offset the measures for over six years. In addition, it highlights how U.S. firms have been directly affected, with lost sales of over $33 billion between 2021 and 2024, and exposure to retaliation by the Chinese government due to these export controls. The report also explains why this backlash against U.S. companies matters in the context of U.S.-China techno-economic competition. Finally, the report proposes a framework to address the global rise of Chinese technology companies: ▪ The United States should press more countries to ban Huawei’s imports. ▪ Export controls should be applied jointly with allies, or not at all. ▪ Export control measures must consider impacts on U.S. firms and techno-economic power. Huawei is a privately owned company headquartered in Shenzhen, China, with close ties to the Chinese government, and is one of the world’s largest technology companies. [7] The firm reported revenues of $124 billion in 2024, of which information and communication technologies (ICT) infrastructure accounted for 43 percent, and consumer markets (e.g., smartphones, laptops, wearables, and tablets) accounted for 39 percent. [8] Other areas of the company’s business include smart grids and energy storage technologies, cloud computing, and smart automotive solutions. Starting around 2018, U.S. policymakers viewed the growing presence of Huawei within 5G networks as a cybersecurity threat. Policymakers argued that Huawei’s technologies could enable the Chinese government to conduct espionage through backdoors. [9] To address this concern, the U.S. government imposed a de facto import ban on Huawei through a patchwork of measures. (See table 1.) In addition, the global expansion of the company within 5G networks was also assessed as a cybersecurity concern, prompting the government to launch a diplomatic campaign to urge allies and trade partners to follow suit. [10] Table 1. De facto import bans—actions to exclude Huawei from U.S. 5G networks (2017 to present). [11] Date Measure Instrument December 2017 Prohibition by the U.S. Department of Defense from purchasing products from Huawei or ZTE for covered missions. National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2018 May 2018 Ban on retail sales of phones and other telecommunication devices from Huawei and ZTE within U.S. military facilities. U.S. Department of Defense ruling August 2018 Prohibition of all federal procurements from Huawei and ZTE. Additionally, it extended the ban to federal grants, loans, and subsidies, thereby broadening the impact of the restriction to most local government entities. NDAA for fiscal year 2019 May 2019 National emergency declaration due to alleged threats to the national telecommunications supply chain and authorization for the Department of Commerce to ban transactions from organizations considered “foreign adversaries.” Executive Order (EO) 13873 January 2020 Denial of transactions to purchase equipment from companies categorized as a national security threat to any recipient of federal telecommunications subsidies. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling March 2020 Total ban of telecommunication equipment or services that pose a national security risk, and a program to remove any such equipment and services currently used in U.S. networks. Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act of 2019 June 2020 Ban of Huawei and ZTE from receiving Universal Service Funds (USF), and force potential U.S. fund recipients to remove their equipment. FCC ruling January 2021 Establishment of a review process to potentially ban transactions from companies that pose a national security risk, including Huawei. 2021 Department of Commerce’s to enforcement of EO 13873 January 2021 Forcing of rural carriers to remove and replace Huawei equipment, offering reimbursement. FCC ruling November 2022 Prohibition of allowing Huawei telecom or surveillance equipment to enter the United States through the FCC’s Certification process or any other so-called “backdoors.” FCC ruling December 2024 Amendment and clarification of the January 2021 Department of Commerce’s interim ruling, closing backdoors that allowed Huawei, for example, to update software. Department of Commerce’s final rule implementing EO 13873 May 2025 Prohibition of Chinese labs deemed security risks from testing U.S. electronics. FCC ruling Despite these efforts, many allied countries and nations from the so-called Global South still use Huawei technologies for their 5G infrastructure. (See figure 1.) As of September 2025, over 3.2 billion people outside China resided in countries that use 5G networks that rely on Huawei equipment, while another 370 million live in countries where Huawei is not banned but is absent from their 5G networks. Huawei remains embedded in the 5G networks of nine U.S. allies—Hungary, Iceland, Italy, South Korea, Spain, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Thailand, and Turkey—and is being phased out from six others: Belgium, France, Germany, Poland, Romania, and the United Kingdom. [12] Among the rest, Huawei’s 5G is banned in 12 countries, and 10 countries have excluded the company without the need for a ban. [13] Figure 1. Prevalence of Huawei technologies in 5G infrastructure outside China [14] In early 2019, Huawei’s alleged business with the Iranian regime, and to a lesser extent with the North Korean regime, led the U.S. government to take action to penalize the company. The efforts taken to punish Huawei caused the U.S. government to lose focus on strengthening America’s power in the context of its techno-economic competition with China. As this report describes in further sections, these actions ultimately weakened U.S. competitiveness by hurting American companies. The U.S. government started judicial and administrative actions to sanction Huawei: ▪ Judicial actions. In January 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed indictments against Huawei and its CFO, Wanzhou Meng, the daughter of the founder, Ren Zhengfei, for bank fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy, and obstruction of justice. [15] Meng’s case was dismissed with prejudice in 2022. [16] The broader criminal case against Huawei is expected to begin in early 2026, which also includes allegations of its business dealings with the North Korean government. [17] ▪ Administrative actions. The U.S. Department of Commerce’s BIS announced the inclusion of Huawei and its subsidiaries on the Entity List in May 2019, arguing that the company “has been involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.” [18] The specific accusation that led to its inclusion on the Entity List was evasion of sanctions by doing business with the Iranian government. The Entity List is an executive tool used to target foreign individuals and organizations, subject to specific license requirements for the transaction of certain goods. [19] U.S. companies had a significant role in Huawei’s supply chain by the time it was included on the Entity List, and U.S. government officials attempted to “kill” or “cripple” the company using this as leverage. [20] By 2019, American companies accounted for one-third of Huawei’s expenses, with U.S. firms comprising 33 of its top 92 vendor suppliers. [21] These companies provided essential inputs to Huawei, such as chipsets used in headsets and telecommunications networks, equipment, electronic components, OSs, and semiconductor design software. [22] However, the U.S. government underestimated the Chinese government’s support for Huawei and the company’s innovation capabilities to overcome the attempts to damage its supply chain critically. The U.S. government attempted to cripple Huawei by enforcing Entity List-based export controls. The inclusion on the Entity List means a ban on any sale or transfer of U.S. technologies without a license from BIS, including R&D collaboration. The requirement for a license is extended to the export and re-export of all products subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), and all applications for licenses are under a “presumption of denial,” meaning the unlikelihood of obtaining exceptions. For Huawei, its inclusion on the Entity List meant that critical inputs from U.S.-based companies would no longer be available, including hardware for its smartphones and other products, as well as software, such as Google Mobile Services. Huawei enjoyed approximately a year and a half of limited breathing room to navigate the 2019 export controls until August 2020. The restrictions that took immediate effect after its inclusion in the Entity List applied to goods subject to the EAR—U.S.-made products and certain foreign goods manufactured using significant U.S. content. In May 2020, BIS expanded the jurisdiction for export controls on foreign-made chips fabricated with U.S. equipment (i.e., expansion of the Foreign-Produced Direct Product Rule), explicitly citing HiSilicon, a semiconductor subsidiary, as an example of Huawei’s affiliates targeted by these restrictions. [23] Moreover, following the company’s inclusion on the Entity List, BIS issued successive 90-day temporary general licenses (TGLs) that allowed Huawei to continue obtaining certain U.S. technologies, such as software updates. [24] An August 2020 amendment stopped the TGLs and tightened the Foreign-Produced Direct Product Rule, including foreign-made chips fabricated “from U.S. technology or software to support the manufacture of indigenous chipsets,” effectively limiting the company’s access to the world’s most advanced chips produced by the Taiwanese firm TSMC. [25] The restrictions after August 2020 included some exceptions, as BIS introduced a permanent authorization for “cybersecurity research and vulnerability disclosure.” For instance, in November 2020, Qualcomm and Intel announced that the U.S. government had granted licenses to sell a limited number of products, including 4G technology for mobile devices; these licenses were later revoked in May 2024. [26] Microsoft received a license allowing it to include Windows in Huawei’s laptops, which expired in March 2025. [27] Additionally, in September 2022, BIS granted a permanent authorization to collaborate with Huawei and its subsidiaries on standards setting and dialogue, aiming to prevent the fragmentation of international 5G and Wi-Fi protocols. [28] In 2022, the Biden administration announced export controls on advanced semiconductors and equipment to slow the Chinese semiconductor industry as a whole—i.e., not targeting specific companies. [29] These measures led some American companies to redesign some of their products to meet U.S. government standards. A notable example is Nvidia’s H20 chip, which is a second-tier version of its advanced data center chips designed to meet the 2022 restrictions. [30] The U.S. government later banned the export of the H20 chip in January 2025—which boosted Huawei's Ascend 910C chips in the Chinese market almost immediately—and later lifted the ban in July of that year. [31] Export Controls During the 1980s U.S.-Japan Technological Competition The United States was once able to halt the growth of entire industries that threatened American global leadership, such as the U.S.-Japan technology rivalry in the 1980s, particularly in the semiconductor sector. But the conditions that led the United States to stop the Japanese semiconductor industry’s growth do not apply to today’s U.S.-China techno-economic competition. The rapid rise of the Japanese economy during the 1980s was viewed as a threat by some U.S. policymakers. Japanese semiconductor, automotive, and consumer electronics companies were quickly gaining global market share, while Japan’s economy was largely inaccessible to American competitors. In 1985, the United States launched a Section 301 investigation—an instrument of the U.S. Trade Act used to impose trade remedies in response to unfair trade practices—against Japan’s semiconductor and electronics industries based on allegations of dumping and currency manipulation, leading to a 100 percent tariff on Japanese electronics. [32] Additionally, in 1986, both countries reached an agreement on semiconductors: Japan committed not to compete against the United States through dumping and allowed U.S. semiconductors to capture a 20 percent share of its domestic market. [33] Some experts consider these measures the “start of the decline for Japan’s semiconductor industry.” [34] Japan’s semiconductor industry grew rapidly during the 1980s, and it temporarily held the majority of the global market between 1986 and 1992. [35] (See figure 2.) The United States was able to regain its global market share through a mix of measures: addressing Japanese unfair trade practices, implementing industrial policies to support the American semiconductor industry, and capitalizing on shifts in global demand toward microprocessors and logic chips. A notable example of how the United States treated this as a public-private effort is the Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology (SEMATECH) consortium, created in 1987 by 14 U.S. semiconductor firms, which received $870 million from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). [36] An example of the United States sanctioning a specific Japanese company is the “Toshiba-Kongsberg scandal” in 1986, when it was revealed that Toshiba Machine, a subsidiary of the Japanese electronics manufacturer Toshiba Corporation, had sold sensitive technologies to the Soviet Union (USSR). [37] Toshiba’s tools, combined with those of the Norwegian weapons manufacturer Kongsberg—a company that was also supplying the USSR—were used to reduce the detection of nuclear submarines. [38] Toshiba Machine was sanctioned by the United States in 1988, which banned Toshiba Corp. and Toshiba Machine from public procurement, along with certain Toshiba Machine products, for three years. [39] Figure 2 : U.S. and Japanese global semiconductor market share, by revenues, 1984–2019 [40] The context and effectiveness of the U.S. government’s measures against Japanese companies in the 1980s differ from the ongoing U.S.-China techno-economic rivalry, as summarized in table 2. Table 2: Summary of the U.S.-Japan (1980s) vs. U.S.-China (present day) tech rivalry Context Similarities Differences Geopolitical Both represent contests between the United States and a rising economy. Japan was (and remains) a U.S. ally; China is a strategic rival. Japan cooperated; China retaliates and pushes decoupling. Trade Large bilateral trade deficits drove/drive tensions. Today’s globalized supply chains make restrictions harder to enforce and less effective. Industrial policy Semiconductors were and remain central to competition. The U.S. responded with industrial policies promoting the semiconductor industry (SEMATECH in 1987; CHIPS Act in 2022). U.S.–China rivalry spans more sectors, including advanced and military technologies. Japan’s security risks were product-specific, with few IP theft concerns; contrary to the current concerns about Chinese technology firms. Firm-level support Both relied/rely on “national champions” (Toshiba, Huawei) that benefited/benefit from state support and protected markets. Japanese firms are private conglomerates (keiretsu). Chinese firms are state-owned or closely tied to the CCP. Before the export controls, Huawei and its subsidiaries held a significant global market share in several of their businesses. Huawei has not fully recovered its revenues before the restrictions; however, the company has demonstrated resilience by regaining market share, mainly relying on the Chinese market. Some examples are listed below: ▪ Lower market share on smartphone shipments than before the export controls, but a higher participation in the Chinese market. The company had a 20 percent global market share in smartphone shipments by 2019, which dropped to “virtually zero” after the restrictions, although by December 2024, it had increased to 4 percent. [41] As of April 2025, Huawei was virtually tied with Xiaomi as the most popular mobile phone company in China, with approximately 18 percent market share. [42] ▪ Similar market share in ICT infrastructure before and after export controls. Huawei currently holds at least 31 percent of the global revenue for radio access network (RAN) products, slightly higher than its 30 percent market share in 2016. [43] ▪ Regaining market share in smartphone chipsets. The market share of smartphone chipsets from HiSilicon, Huawei’s semiconductor design subsidiary, peaked in the second quarter of 2020 at 16 percent, making it the third-largest supplier worldwide. However, it dropped to zero in the second quarter of 2022 and rebounded to 4 percent in the first quarter of 2025. [44] After its inclusion in the Entity List, Huawei is focusing on launching products that replace those previously supplied by U.S. companies. Notably, the company claims to have developed “an ecosystem entirely independent of the United States.” [45] One of the pillars of this independent ecosystem is Huawei’s in-house built OS, HarmonyOS, which was initially developed as a “backup plan” in case of U.S. restrictions; the company now expects it to become “a third mobile operating system for the world.” [46] HarmonyOS is also compatible with computers, and there are reports that Huawei is rolling out its laptops with this system instead of Microsoft’s Windows. [47] Huawei is focusing on launching products that replace those previously supplied by U.S. companies, and it claims to have developed “an ecosystem entirely independent of the United States.” Cutting off Android and Windows OS helped create and accelerate the deployment of Huawei’s OS. HarmonyOS runs on over 1 billion devices, and supports smartphones, laptops, tablets, and over 1,000 peripheral devices such as printers. [48] Huawei is exploring using HarmonyOS in other developments, such as microsatellites—and with its new generation, HarmonyOS NEXT, the firm expects to complete the decoupling from Western-led OSs. [49] According to Chinese media, HarmonyOS was developed with the collaboration of 20 research institutes and 10,000 engineers, and the effort has registered over 2,700 patents. Some Western companies operating in China, such as BMW, have already partnered with Huawei to incorporate its OS into their next-generation vehicles. [50] The effort to build an indigenous OS aligns closely with the PRC’s goals of technological self-reliance and challenges Western dominance in global markets. Android and Apple’s iOS account for nearly 99 percent of the worldwide smartphone market, and Apple, Google, and Microsoft together account for more than 90 percent of the laptop OSs’ share. [51] Moreover, OpenHarmony, the software upon which HarmonyOS is based, is managed by the OpenAtom Foundation, a Chinese government-controlled organization. [52] Huawei is also investing in reducing its reliance on foreign chipmaking technologies. The company claims that in 2023 it was able to replace more than 13,000 components and redesign over 4,000 circuit boards. [53] HiSilicon designed a 7 nanometer (nm) chip that compensates for its lower computing power by utilizing HarmonyOS and began deploying this chip in its devices in 2023. [54] Huawei’s AI chip, Ascend 910d, is expected to perform on par with Nvidia’s H100, one of the company’s most advanced products, yet at nearly 60–70 percent of its cost. [55] However, some reports estimate that Huawei lags significantly behind Western chipmakers, such as Nvidia and AMD, and will struggle to compete outside China. [56] Reports suggest that Huawei can substitute Nvidia’s H20 chip with the Ascend 920 model, announced in April 2025. [57] It is expected that Huawei will become China's top AI chipmaker by 2026, with the opening of three new plants. [58] Despite this, the company will not have the necessary scale to meet demand in the Chinese market within the next year. [59] In addition, Nvidia reported halting H20 chip production in August 2025 due to significant pushback from the Chinese government, and reports suggest that Chinese technology companies have been banned from acquiring it since September 2025 due to cybersecurity concerns. [60] The company is also opening new product lines, directly competing against U.S. firms. For example, Huawei’s smart driving solutions have been implemented in at least half a million cars, and some analysts suggest its technology is superior to Tesla’s. [61] The Huawei MateBook X Pro and Huawei’s Watch D also offer features and specifications that are often considered equal to or superior to those of Western competitors. [62] The export controls did not take into account the Chinese government’s efforts to secure the company’s survival. There is precedent for the Chinese government intervening to rescue the company. Ren Zhengfei, Huawei’s founder and president, stated that “Huawei would no longer exist” without protectionist policies to shield it from foreign competitors during its internationalization efforts in the 2000s. [63] At that time, Chinese-backed loans, such as those from the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China, aided Huawei’s international expansion, allowing the company to outbid competitors and adopt a “vacuum-cleaner approach … just sucking up the market.” [64] Over the 2010s, Huawei and state-owned ZTE artificially gained market share from Ericsson and Nokia in telecommunications equipment through direct support from the Chinese government, as well as indirect support such as restricting foreign companies’ access to the expanding Chinese market. [65] Following the U.S. export controls in 2019, Huawei continues to receive support from the PRC through financial support, direct procurement from state-owned Chinese companies, and a continued preferential treatment as a “national champion” for strategic national initiatives. Huawei’s success stands on the shoulders of Chinese innovation mercantilism. By 2019, Huawei had received $75 billion in state support since its establishment, including $1.6 billion in grants, $46.3 billion in credit facilities, $25 billion in tax breaks, and $2 billion in subsidized land purchases. [66] This helped the company gain market share, particularly in the global telecommunications equipment market. The company has also benefited from various other types of government support, including its role as a recipient of Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects, which helped the company expand its global footprint and build the necessary connections to navigate restrictions. [67] The Chinese government has implemented various practices to support Huawei and other national champions, including protecting the domestic market, undervaluing the currency, promoting exports, and ignoring intellectual property (IP) theft. [68] The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) has a longstanding record of reporting on how the PRC has subsidized Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications companies, such as ZTE. Huawei’s and ZTE’s global market share, primarily accumulated during the 2010s, was a direct result of China’s mercantilist policies and programs, such as closing China’s market to foreign companies, thereby securing a sizable customer base. [69] A 2020 ITIF study found that if Ericsson and Nokia had captured Huawei’s and ZTE’s equivalent market shares, the world would have seen a 20 percent increase in telecommunications equipment R&D investments and 75 additional essential 5G patents. [70] Hence, Chinese state support for Huawei not only helps advance China’s agenda of techno-economic dominance at the expense of Western incumbents, but also undermines overall global innovation. Following its inclusion in the Entity List in 2019, Huawei continues to receive support from the PRC. For example, the company has received more than 215 billion yuan ($30 billion) from the central and Shenzhen governments to acquire two chip plants and to build at least three others. [71] The PRC’s continued support is reflected in several additional ways: ▪ Favorable financial support to mitigate the effects of the export controls . HONOR, a former Huawei subsidiary, is a budget-brand smartphone whose business was heavily affected by U.S. restrictions, as it relied on U.S. semiconductors for its hardware and had access to the Google Play Store for its software. [72] HONOR was acquired in 2020 for 100 billion yuan ($15.2 billion) by a consortium of private and state-backed investors. [73] In this transaction, the Chinese government acted as the “investor of first resort,” allowing Huawei to divest from an asset subject to export controls under its ownership, while the PRC government secured the continuation of production for a company that, after the acquisition, was able to keep importing foreign chips. [74] ▪ Direct procurement from state-owned Chinese companies . The PRC has consistently favored China’s national champions through the procurement of public agencies or state-owned companies. For example, in 2021, China Mobile, a state-owned Chinese telecommunications company, announced that Huawei would be the vendor for 60 percent of 5G network station contracts. [75] (ZTE acquired nearly 30 percent, while Western competitors such as Ericsson and Nokia received the remaining few contracts.) China Mobile allocated Huawei 52 percent of a $1.1 billion contract for 5G network deployment between 2023 and 2024. [76] (Ericsson and Nokia received 13 percent of the resources; notably, another Chinese state-owned company, Datang Mobile, received awards in addition to ZTE.) What ITIF stated in 2020 remains valid in 2025: “The only reason a non-Chinese firm is allowed to gain 5G market share is to continue the illusion of an open competitive market, and to give the Chinese government leverage over European governments that seek to limit Huawei deployment in Europe. If the EU threatens to take strong action against unfair Chinese practices, the Chinese government can retaliate by threatening to completely exclude European providers.” [77] ▪ Continued preferential treatment as a “national champion” for strategic national initiatives . Huawei has been one of the primary beneficiaries of China’s industrial policies aimed at promoting the country’s strategic industry upgrades. For instance, the 2023 expansion of the semiconductor R&D tax incentive served as a de facto subsidy for Huawei and HiSilicon (Huawei’s semiconductor design subsidiary), among others, since semiconductor R&D expenditure can yield up to a 220 percent deduction from the company’s taxable income. [78] In 2023, the PRC designated Huawei—along with Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment (AMEC), Naura, and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC)—as targets for increased governmental support for semiconductors, without requiring the demonstration of performance objectives. [79] (To be sure, semiconductor tax credits can be legitimate tools for nations to use to promote their semiconductor industries, so long as those tax credits are made available equally to companies from all countries competing in a nation’s market.) Since 2012, Huawei has shifted toward greater reliance on the Chinese domestic market to buffer against restrictions, invested heavily in R&D, developed capabilities to produce in-house critical hardware and software, and stockpiled resources to survive the first year after restrictions. ITIF noted in 2020 that export controls were “shooting U.S. exporters in the foot,” as they went beyond protecting the U.S. telecommunications networks for cybersecurity reasons, limited U.S. company exports, and incentivized Huawei “to produce its own inputs, including computer chips.” [81] This assessment proved to be accurate. Moreover, the export controls overlooked that Huawei had prepared for a restrictions scenario for over six years before the company was added to the Entity List in 2019. Notably, a 2012 U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence special report revealed the company’s unfair practices and its ties with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) acted as an early warning. [82] Since 2012, Huawei has shifted toward greater reliance on the Chinese domestic market to buffer against restrictions, invested heavily in R&D, developed capabilities to produce in-house critical hardware and software, and stockpiled resources to survive the first year after restrictions. A year after the 2012 House report, Huawei initiated an aggressive public relations campaign in the United States to improve its image. When the campaign did not lessen the scrutiny over the company’s practices and cybersecurity concerns, it officially declared that it was “not interested in the U.S. market anymore,” noting that its U.S. market sales were only $1 billion. [83] (This ignored the fact that the company relied heavily on U.S. technology components for all its operations.) While the 2000s were a decade of international expansion for Huawei, the company reversed this trend in the subsequent decade. Before the 2008 global financial crisis, Huawei’s global expansion led to a significant increase in its non-Chinese revenues, jumping from 21 percent in 2005 to 75 percent in 2008. As the shock from the crisis led the company to increase its share in Chinese markets by 15 percentage points from 2008 to 2009, Huawei slowly recovered its income from non-Chinese markets by 2011. However, since 2012, Huawei has significantly expanded its presence and increasingly relied on revenues from China. By 2019, China represented 59 percent of Huawei’s revenues, and in its latest 2024 annual report, China provided 71 percent of revenues. Figure 3: Huawei’s revenues from China as a share of total revenues [84] While revenues from China have increased in relative terms for the company since 2012, revenues from the rest of the world also rose in the years leading up to the U.S. restrictions. As shown in figure 4, Huawei’s global revenues increased 2.5 times between 2011 and 2020, the years when revenues peaked. However, revenues generated in China grew sixfold during this period, whereas revenues from non-Chinese markets rose by 78 percent. Revenues from China have served as a buffer to offset the impact of U.S. export controls. During the first year after them, revenues from China increased by 12 percent, offsetting the 14 percent decline in non-Chinese markets, which enabled Huawei to report an overall year-over-year increase. In the following years, revenues from China bounced back rapidly. Between 2019 and 2024, revenues from China increased by 4 percent, while revenues from non-Chinese markets declined by 7 percent. Figure 4: Huawei’s revenues by region (billion CNY, 2024 prices) [85] Revenues from China have served as a buffer to offset the impact of U.S. export controls. One example of how the Chinese market has served as a buffer is Huawei’s market share for smartphone devices. The company once dominated the Chinese smartphone market, accounting for 37 percent and 38 percent of total sales in 2019 and 2020, respectively. As the export controls affected the firm’s production, by 2021, this market share had fallen to approximately 5 percent. Considering that HONOR spun off from Huawei through the previously described state-supported acquisition, the comparison of post-restrictions market share should involve both companies. In this context, despite a challenging 2021, the combined market share of Huawei and HONOR in China averaged 29 percent for the 2022 to 2024 period. (See figure 5.) As of 2025, Huawei’s market share in this sector has virtually tied with Xiaomi, making it one of the two most dominant ICT companies in China. Figure 5: Huawei’s market share in China for smartphone sales [86] Huawei outperformed all its competitors in terms of R&D investment before the U.S. restrictions. Between 2013 (the first full year after the October 2012 House report on Huawei) and 2020, Huawei increased its real R&D expenditure by more than threefold, surpassing that of any other peer company, as shown in figure 6. Regardless of whether this investment—which exceeded that of the rest of the industry—was motivated by global expansion or by the fact that Huawei executives were indeed accounting for restrictions risks, in practice, these years of R&D overspending allowed the company to build a knowledge base to confront the restrictions challenge. Figure 6: Real R&D expenditure growth by company (indexed; 2013 = 100) [87] Growth in Huawei’s R&D expenditures declined after the restrictions, yet it still set a record for the company in 2023 and 2024. [88] Huawei’s efforts to develop (or catch up with) frontier technologies have not diminished. One way to approximate this is by examining R&D intensity, which considers the company’s R&D expenditure as a share of total revenues for a given year. Huawei had historically lagged behind in corporate R&D compared to competitors such as Ericsson and Nokia. [89] However, as figure 7 shows, U.S. restrictions forced the company to increase its R&D intensity to an average of 20 percent between 2019 and 2023, outperforming all competitors except Intel (which competes with Huawei only in one of Huawei’s businesses: semiconductors). Figure 7: R&D intensity by company (R&D expenditure as a share of net sales) [90] Huawei took advantage of the TGL granted after its designation to the Entity List to release HarmonyOS. Additionally, Huawei increased its number of R&D personnel since the U.S. restrictions were imposed, hiring more than 17,000 employees in this field between 2019 and 2024. (See figure 8.) While Huawei’s R&D staff accounted for 45 percent of the total staff count during the five years preceding the restrictions (2014–2018), this proportion rose to an average of 55 percent in the five years following the U.S. inclusion of the company on the Entity List (2020–2024). There is no available information about the specific units or research projects to which these additional R&D researchers have been assigned. Figure 8: Number of R&D employees and R&D personnel as a share of total employees for Huawei [91] The export control for software, in practice, began in August 2020 after BIS stopped granting the TGL. [92] This meant that Huawei would lose access to all non-open-source dealings, such as licensing for Google’s Android OS, Google’s Play Store app ecosystem, and any other software-related business with U.S.-headquartered companies. Huawei sold its handsets with Android Open Source Project in China (since Google’s services were blocked in the country due to censorship) and the Google-certified Android OS for the rest of the world as the integrated OS. Microsoft enjoyed a license until March 2025, allowing it to include Windows OS in Huawei’s laptops. [93] Huawei took advantage of the TGL granted after its designation to the Entity List to release HarmonyOS in August 2019. The company had previously explored using another OS instead of Android, such as Microsoft’s Windows Phone OS or Samsung’s Tizen in 2014. [94] Huawei explicitly built its in-house OS in anticipation of potential U.S. restrictions—two months before the restrictions, a spokesperson stated, “Huawei does have backup systems but only for use in extenuating circumstances.” [95] Some reports indicate that the company has been prepared for “worst-case scenarios” since the 2012 House report. [96] Evidence suggests that the firm was preparing for an indigenous OS as early as 2013–2014. For example, LiteOS, an OS for real-time Internet-of-Things devices, was launched in 2015. [97] Some of the functions of LiteOS used to build HarmonyOS and its open-source version, OpenHarmony, are described as its direct predecessors. [98] Similarly, the technology enabling cross-device tasks and efficient resource allocation scheduling for the OS patent application dates back to May 2015, suggesting that at least part of the research was conducted in 2014 or earlier. [99] Huawei developed semiconductor capabilities to achieve self-sufficiency in the event of U.S. restrictions. To achieve this goal, the company took three clear actions: invested in its main chip design subsidiary (HiSilicon), began working with companies that have complementary strengths in the semiconductor supply chain, and created incentives to develop an ecosystem within China through an investment platform. HiSilicon, fully owned by and originating as a spin-off of Huawei in the 2000s, served as the cornerstone of Huawei’s backup plans for chips. The day after the export controls were announced in May 2019, HiSilicon’s CEO sent a letter warning that the company had been preparing a “spare tire” for the survival of Huawei. [100] HiSilicon provided Huawei with the organizational and staffing capabilities to develop physical components that could replace U.S. technologies. By 2012, HiSilicon had developed at least 120 chip designs and distributed at least 150 million chips. [101] HiSilicon has been developing chips branded as Kirin since 2014 and helped design the world’s first 7 nm chipset commercialized with 5G support, Kirin 980, in 2018 in partnership with TSMC. [102] HiSilicon produced more than $7 billion worth of chips during the period before the 2019 restrictions. [103] The second action taken was to collaborate with companies that have complementary capabilities. For example, in 2015, Huawei announced a joint venture with SMIC (a partially state-owned Chinese company), Imec (a Belgian research consortium), and Qualcomm (a U.S. semiconductor company) called SMIC Advanced Technology Research & Development (Shanghai) Corporation. This joint venture, majority owned by SMIC, focused on R&D to develop 14 nm semiconductor technology for mass production by 2020. [104] SMIC announced the start of volume production for the 14 nm chip in late 2019, and the first commercialization took place in 2020 with HiSilicon’s 14 nm Kirin 710A chip. [105] Finally, Huawei sought to build a local ecosystem of suppliers to strengthen China’s self-sufficiency in semiconductors. In 2019, before Huawei’s inclusion on the Entity List, the company launched Hubble, a venture capital subsidiary designed as an investment vehicle for semiconductor startups, with a registered capital exceeding $100 million. Before the establishment of Hubble, Huawei had maintained a practice of not investing in third-party companies. [106] To date, Hubble has invested in at least 100 startups. [107] For example, it is an investor in companies developing key semiconductor fabrication processes, such as Focuslight Technologies (a photolithography equipment maker), Suzhou Everbright Photonics (a gallium-nitride chipmaker), and Xuzhou Chemicals (which develops photoresist technologies used in lithography). [108] Hubble is currently being used to further promote Huawei’s ecosystem by funding startups that would be locked into it, for instance, by investing in humanoid robots that can integrate the company’s new developments in chips (Huawei’s Ascend AI chips), large language models (Pangu), and HarmonyOS. [109] The cumulative congressional and executive actions raising concerns about Huawei during late 2017 onward allowed the company to take actions to mitigate potential U.S. measures against it. For example, Huawei’s inventories of raw materials expanded by more than 86 percent from 2017 to 2018, and the company has kept a high level of stockpiles of raw materials since the restrictions relative to other inventories. (See figure 9.) These raw materials include electronic components and sub-assemblies used in manufacturing telecommunication equipment and consumer devices, as well as large orders of the 7 nm Tiangang core chips, manufactured by TSMC using U.S. wafer fabrication equipment and supplying Huawei until the end of the TGL. [110] These inventory levels allowed the company to effectively boost its revenues during the first year after it was added to the Entity List, in addition to other measures such as issuing bonds in the Chinese market for over $800 million to increase liquidity and reduce its financial reliance on foreign markets. [111] Figure 9: Huawei’s raw materials as a share of total inventories [112] The U.S. actions against Huawei served as an incentive for the company to accelerate its decoupling from U.S. technologies. U.S. exports to Huawei exceeded $11 billion when the firm was added to the Entity List. [113] Without those inputs, it created a “void” in Huawei’s supply chain that was mostly filled by Huawei’s in-house processes or Chinese technologies. Restrictions against the company harmed U.S. businesses by reducing sales of former Huawei suppliers and triggering retaliation from the PRC against them. ITIF estimates that restrictions on doing business with Huawei caused U.S. companies to lose at least $33 billion in sales between 2021 and 2024. This estimation is based on two main priors. Before U.S. restrictions, Huawei spent roughly 33 percent of its operating costs on American suppliers. [114] Following the August 2020 amendment to terminate the TGLs, BIS authorized a limited number of export licenses from 2021 to 2024; however, this information is not publicly available. [115] Anecdotal evidence suggests that Huawei purchased between 5 and 10 percent of its operating costs from U.S. firms during this period; ITIF conservatively estimates that share to be 15 percent. [116] To model what would have happened without the export controls, ITIF combined two different types of alternatives for Huawei, creating a total of four different estimations, summarized in figure 10. The first case involves trying to infer what Huawei’s growth would be without U.S. restrictions. To do this, ITIF modeled two scenarios: the “current sales” scenario (using existing data on Huawei’s performance) and a “no export controls scenario,” which assumes that Huawei’s sales would follow the same pattern as the average of its main Western competitors (Alphabet, Apple, Ericsson, Nokia, and Microsoft) from 2021–2024. The second consideration for Huawei in this analysis is whether the company was already on a path to decouple from U.S. technologies, regardless of U.S. actions. To explore this, ITIF modeled two cases: a base case wherein U.S. firms accounted for roughly 33 percent of Huawei’s operating costs for all years (business-as-usual suppliers, or “BAU suppliers,” scenario) and a “decoupling scenario,” assuming Huawei would fully decouple from U.S. technologies by 2027—the 100th anniversary of the PLA. Figure 10. Lost sales to U.S. suppliers due to export controls against Huawei between 2021 and 2024 (billions) [117] Sales from U.S. firms to Huawei helped sustain American market share in key technology products and funded R&D projects, preventing China from capturing that share. At the industry level, Huawei often did not represent a significant portion of the revenues of American advanced manufacturing companies. (See table 3.) However, these sales helped U.S. companies reach the necessary volumes and margins to invest in innovation, ultimately maintaining competitiveness and market share. Restrictions against Huawei directly harmed U.S. businesses by reducing sales of former Huawei suppliers and triggering retaliation from the PRC against them. The restrictions also had a secondary effect on American companies supplying Huawei. Many of them reported in their annual statements that U.S. action negatively impacted the overall demand for their products. For example, Analog Devices Inc., an American semiconductor company, reported in its 2020 annual report that restrictions were “causing our current or potential customers to amass large inventories of our products, replace our products with products from another supplier that is not subject to the export restrictions, or focus on building indigenous semiconductor capacity to reduce reliance on U.S. suppliers.” [118] Table 4: Examples of U.S. advanced manufacturing companies affected by the export controls [119] Company Example of What It Supplied to Huawei Relevant Financial Information Analog Devices Inc. Chips used in radio systems for 5G telecommunications networks Sales to Huawei represented between 2 and 3 percent of total sales by 2020. Broadcom Wireless communication chips for smartphones and other devices Huawei represented 4 percent of Broadcom’s revenues in 2019, or $900 million. Cadence Electronic design automation software (EDA), also provided to HiSilicon In May 2025, the U.S. government imposed new export controls on EDA sales to Chinese companies. Intel License to ship laptop central processors to Huawei in 2020 (revoked in 2024) When the 2024 license was revoked, Intel maintained its revenue expectation for the year, but “below the midpoint” between $12.5 billion and $13.5 billion. Micron Technology Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) Huawei represented 13 percent of revenues by February 2019. Qorvo Radio frequency (RF) supplier for Huawei handsets and base stations Huawei accounted for 13 percent of 2019 revenues, 10 percent in 2020, and 5 percent in 2021, after which it stopped reporting significant sales. Qualcomm License in 2020 to sell older 4G chips to Huawei (revoked in 2024) Between October 2023 and May 2024, revenues from Huawei represented $560 million (1.4 percent for the fiscal year ending in September 2024) Texas Instruments Analog chips for Huawei smartphones and telecom equipment Sales to Huawei represented between 3 and 4 percent of total sales in 2019. Giving Away Market Share to a Foreign Competitor: The Case of Teradyne Teradyne is an American manufacturing company specializing in Automated Test Equipment (ATE) for the semiconductor industry. ATE plays a critical role in semiconductor manufacturing, as it guarantees essential quality controls during the different stages of the process. Teradyne, along with its Japanese competitor Advantest, together account for roughly 80–90 percent of the global market for semiconductor testers in many segments. [120] Teradyne is also a global leader in advanced robotics through its subsidiary Universal Robots. [121] As the export controls against Huawei limited the supply of U.S. technologies to the firm, but were not coordinated with allies, Teradyne was impacted, but its Japanese competitor was not. Thus, Huawei replaced Teradyne’s inputs with Advantest’s, giving up global market share. [122] Advantest’s global market share for semiconductor testers grew from 43 percent in 2020 to 58 percent in 2024, while Teradyne’s declined roughly in a similar, inverse proportion. [123] The restrictions have also harmed Teradyne’s ability to keep investing in innovation capabilities. The company observed two consecutive years of revenue decline, from $3.7 billion in 2021 to $2.7 billion in 2023. As of September 2025, it had not recovered its pre-restriction sales. This revenue loss has impacted the firm’s innovation capabilities. Figure 11 shows the R&D expenditure for Advantest and Teradyne, indexed in 2020, when restrictions began. After the restrictions came into effect for ATE products, Advantest was able to expand its R&D expenditure by roughly 50 percent, while Teradyne observed a decrease in real R&D expenditure. Figure 11 . R&D expenditure (indexed; 2020 = 100). [124] U.S. restrictions also compelled American companies to cancel their contracts with Huawei, such as the earlier removal of Google’s Play Store from Huawei devices. This meant that Huawei’s wearables could not be updated to meet Google’s security and development standards. [125] A similar pattern occurred with Microsoft and its laptop OS, the Windows series. Windows’ license to Huawei expired in March 2025, giving the Chinese company enough time to incorporate HarmonyOS into its laptops. [126] After March 2025, reports indicate that Huawei is only rolling out laptops using its in-house-built OS, HarmonyOS, threatening Microsoft’s market share. [127] While there has not been a formal retaliation from the Chinese government against the United States due to Huawei’s inclusion on the Entity List, the PRC has since taken actions that effectively serve as a response to the restrictions. A few months after the restrictions were imposed in 2019, Cisco executives declared that the company was “uninvited” to compete in bids by Chinese state-owned companies. [128] Thus, Cisco was de facto barred from continuing to sell telecommunications infrastructure to Chinese carriers. (Cisco still sells equipment to other Chinese companies, such as electric vehicle makers.) [129] In December 2019, the PRC instructed all government agencies to phase out foreign-made technologies, including hardware and software, by 2022. [130] This measure was directly targeted at reducing the market share of American firms, such as Dell, HP, and Microsoft, while being functional to the PRC’s goal of technological self-sufficiency. Likewise, local governments in China, such as Shenzhen, started promoting the adoption of HarmonyOS as their primary system, under the “Shenzhen Action Plan for Supporting the Development of Native HarmonyOS Open Source Applications in 2024,” which is seen as a basis for a nation-wide initiative to phase out American OS. [131] In addition, the PRC established its version of the Entity List in May 2019, called the “Unreliable Entity List,” with a justification similar to that of the American version. [132] This tool provides the PRC with a legal basis to target retaliatory measures against specific companies, primarily American ones. The Unreliable Entity List uniquely includes American companies, and it has been utilized by the Chinese government as a “bargaining tool” during ongoing trade negotiations, highlighting the retaliatory nature of the measure. [133] The U.S.–China techno-economic rivalry plays out across every strategic sector, including those in which Huawei competes with American firms for global market share. As ITIF has reported, China is rapidly catching up with the United States in robotics, electronic displays, and artificial intelligence, and it lags behind in machine tools and semiconductors. [134] These are all critical links in Huawei’s supply chain. Because U.S. policy has shaped Huawei’s innovation path, its continued growth erodes America’s competitive edge. The business opportunity loss for American firms doing business with Huawei ultimately matters for the U.S. public interest for three reasons: 1. The acceleration of Huawei’s decoupling from using U.S. technologies impacts American global market share in key products, such as OSs. 2. The loss of revenues from doing business with Huawei undermines American competitiveness, as it limits U.S. firms’ ability to reinvest in R&D and advanced production. [135] 3. The acceleration of Huawei’s decoupling from U.S. technologies is leading to a lock-in of consumers to products within an ecosystem that privileges Chinese standards and supply chains. U.S. technology companies are now in a weaker position to lead globally due to Huawei’s accelerated decoupling. As Nokia and Ericsson were ultimately unable to offset the unfair competition against Huawei and ZTE in 5G, this pattern will likely repeat for the cases of HarmonyOS, the new generation of Huawei’s wearables competing against American firms, or both. The result is likely to be a decline in global market share for companies such as Google and Microsoft. The rationale used by the U.S. government’s actions against Huawei is a legacy of an earlier era, when America could impose sanctions without significantly harming its competitiveness and could hinder the production capabilities of its adversaries. This framework is outdated, as global supply chains have become increasingly complex and Chinese techno-economic power has reached, in some cases, unassailable levels. The United States needs a realistic approach. The fact that the United States is incapable of crippling a company such as Huawei does not preclude the need to take actions against Chinese mercantilism. A modern framework should pair import bans for cybersecurity reasons with limited, targeted export controls on advanced technologies. Some of the measures that U.S. policymakers should consider for this modern framework include the following: ▪ Press more countries to ban Huawei’s imports . In 2020, ITIF recommended that the U.S. government urge its allies to exclude Huawei and ZTE from their markets, particularly in the telecommunications network infrastructure and equipment sector, to counter the companies’ artificial competitiveness resulting from Chinese support and the lack of opportunities for rivals to access the Chinese domestic market. [136] This assessment has not changed. Despite foreign policy’s efforts across multiple U.S. administrations, Huawei remains in many European markets—even as its predatory practices have particularly harmed Ericsson and Nokia. Some allies are phasing out Huawei from their 5G network. Germany, for example, plans to phase out Huawei from core 5G networks by 2026 and from the radio and management layers by 2029. [137] However, nine U.S. allies—Hungary, Iceland, Italy, South Korea, Spain, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Thailand, and Turkey—continue to use Huawei in their 5G infrastructure without a plan to phase out the company entirely. The U.S. government needs to reverse course on its go-it-alone approach to competitiveness and start to bring in a “coalition of the willing” that understands the threat to the West from Chinese national power industry predation and is willing to take collective steps in self-defense. One such step should be to ban further sales of Huawei telecom equipment. A modern framework should pair import bans for cybersecurity reasons with limited, targeted export controls on advanced technologies. ▪ Export controls should be applied jointly with allies, or not at all. Export controls, in part, were ineffective because regulatory loopholes allowed Huawei to fully offset American inputs of the same cost and quality as those of U.S. allies, including Japan. As this report shows, blanket export controls on Huawei have undermined American competitiveness in markets where the company has other substitutes, such as the case of ATE for chipmaking tests. This experience demonstrates that unilateral export controls, besides being ineffective and harmful to U.S. companies, actually work to the advantage of American allies. ▪ Export control measures must consider impacts on U.S. firms and techno-economic power . For decades, U.S. foreign policy makers and mavens were willing to spend U.S. techno-economic power to achieve foreign policy goals, such as sanctioning a country we wanted to punish, such as Iran. America can no longer afford such spending of its “technology capital.” Huawei’s experience demonstrates that export controls are detrimental to the United States in both absolute and relative terms: they reduced the resources available for U.S. companies to invest in R&D and innovation, and helped shape Huawei as a competitor in new products, such as OSs, which now threaten U.S. dominance in this global market. It is time for an intellectual and operational reset. U.S. policymakers cannot assume that the United States maintains global leadership in advanced sectors. American competitiveness is faltering and requires a coordinated strategy, led by the federal government, to reverse this trend. The approach taken by the U.S. government against Huawei, with export controls to sanction the company and cripple it, was hubristic—and ultimately backfired. An import ban on Huawei’s 5G network in the United States, along with urging allies and trade partners to follow suit, would have addressed the cybersecurity concerns about the company. Yet, the measures went beyond. The U.S. government took actions against the company for its alleged business with adversaries, such as Iran, which turned out to be costly for U.S. firms and damaging to American competitiveness. It later tried to cripple the company, underestimating Huawei’s innovation capabilities and the PRC’s support. Moreover, as this report shows, a 2012 Congressional report denouncing the company’s predatory practices and cybersecurity risks served as an early warning that prompted the company to invest in decoupling from U.S. technologies. Huawei’s resiliency threatens American competitiveness and market share. After the implementation of export controls, the company has successfully launched its in-house OS, HarmonyOS, which is now being rolled out on mobile devices, tablets, and laptops—potentially threatening U.S. firms’ market share in these sectors. The company is also catching up in chipmaking and exploring new business lines, such as energy storage technologies and smart automotive solutions. Additionally, this report demonstrates how export restrictions harm U.S. companies, resulting in over $33 billion in lost sales and, in some cases, a relative reduction in R&D investments. The failure of U.S. policies against Huawei evidences an outdated rationale to address Chinese mercantilism. The current U.S.-China techno-economic competition differs significantly from earlier episodes when U.S. technological leadership was challenged. For example, the United States regained its semiconductor lead during the U.S.-Japan rivalry of the 1980s and today commands nearly five times Japan’s global market share. It succeeded by combining restrictions, diplomacy with an allied partner (Japan), and sustained innovation. None of those conditions applies today: Chinese support offsets restrictions, the rivalry is with an adversary rather than an ally, and China has caught up or even pulled ahead in many strategic technologies. In other words, the United States is using yesterday’s tools against a fundamentally different adversary; it needs a realistic, not hubristic, policy approach. Acknowledgments Huawei’s building “spare tires” in anticipation of U.S. sanctions is based on the company’s own statements, notably by Ren Zhengfei in 2019. However, the broader narrative of Huawei’s preparations for U.S. restrictions and the “spare tire” concept was first fully documented and gained broad attention through detailed reporting in Eva Dou’s book House of Huawei: The Secret History of China’s Most Powerful Company . “Backfire,” the title of this report, is also the title of one of Annabel Yao’s singles.

This case should serve as a lesson : U.S. techno-economic power is weaker than most think , and sanctions often hurt U.S. competitiveness more than China ’ s . Contents Key Takeaways 1 Introduction . 2 Huawei 101 : Its Businesses and U.S . Actions Against the Company 4 How Huawei Bounced Back From Export Controls 12 How Export Controls On Huawei Are Affecting U.S. Companies 22 Why This Matters 27 Policy Recommendations 27 Conclusions 29 Endnotes 30 Does the United States have the power to kill Chinese companies ? And can it do so without reducing its own techno-economic power ? At least regarding Huawei , the answer to both questions is a definite no . Due to cybersecurity concerns , since 2018 , the U.S. government has gradually banned the sale of Huawei products for U.S. telecommunications networks and encouraged other nations to do the same . But that was not enough for U.S. policymakers ; they sought to kill the company . In 2019 , the U.S. government sanctioned Huawei for doing business with adversaries , such as Iran , by taking judicial actions and adding the company to the Department of Commerce ’ s Bureau of Industry and Security ( BIS ) Entity List—attempting to cripple Huawei by disrupting its supply chain . Both the Biden and the second Trump administration have continued to sanction the company . The export controls backfired . Huawei is the world ’ s largest telecom equipment manufacturer , and its global market share for telecom equipment increased from 29 percent in early 2018 to 31 percent by 2024 . [ 1 ] At the same time , U.S. technology companies such as Intel , Qualcomm , Teradyne , and others lost more than $ 33 billion in sales to Huawei between 2021 and 2024—in a conservative estimate—weakening these American companies globally while strengthening Chinese or other nations ’ tech companies , including Japan . Additionally , due to the restrictions , Huawei launched its OS , HarmonyOS , in 2019 , which now has nearly a billion users and is compatible with mobiles , tablets , and laptops—a direct threat to Google ’ s Android and Microsoft ’ s Windows ’ global market share . [ 2 ] The company is also catching up on chipmaking , claiming that in 2023 it was able to replace more than 13,000 components and redesign over 4,000 different circuit boards . [ 3 ] It is also reported that Huawei can substitute Nvidia ’ s H20 chip , a specific model that meets the U.S. government ’ s requirements for exporting semiconductors to China—limiting Nvidia ’ s global sales . [ 4 ] As of August 2025 , Huawei claimed to have built an entire ecosystem independent of U.S. technologies . [ 5 ] Huawei was able to do this because it anticipated these U.S. actions as early as 2012 and invested heavily to offset them . [ 6 ] The company ’ s research and development ( R & D ) investments grew proportionally more than those of any other major technology company—including Alphabet , Apple , and Microsoft—and it increased its reliance on the Chinese market to sustain revenues . In addition , the People ’ s Republic of China ( PRC ) provided significant financial support to the company to decouple from the United States after the restrictions were in place . Sanctioning Huawei and attempting to cripple the company has proven to be hubristic and self-defeating—U.S . techno-economic power is weaker than decision-makers in Washington might think . This should be a wake-up call for U.S. policymakers . It ’ s possible the U.S. government might have been able to cripple Huawei in the late 2000s or early 2010s when its and China ’ s technological capabilities were significantly weaker . But by the late 2010s , it was too late . As a result , the only outcome was to weaken U.S. technology companies and strengthen Huawei and China ’ s innovation . Sanctioning Huawei and attempting to cripple the company has proven to be hubristic and self-defeating—U.S . techno-economic power is now weaker than decision-makers in Washington might think . To the extent Huawei poses a cybersecurity threat , excluding it from U.S. networks and urging allies and trade partners to follow suit should have been the sole focus . However , the U.S. government sought to punish Huawei for allegations of doing business with Iran without fully considering the extent of this measure ’ s cost to U.S. companies and for American techno-economic power . Moreover , the U.S. government ’ s attempt to cripple Huawei underestimated the extent of the Chinese government ’ s support for the company , Huawei ’ s technological advancements , and its ability to source non-U.S. inputs or develop them domestically . The U.S. government ’ s approach was outdated , not reflecting the current relative power of the United States . This report shows how export controls accelerated Huawei ’ s innovations and harmed American companies . It first describes the U.S. actions against the company and how the current context differs from the U.S.-Japan technological rivalry of the 1980s , the last time the United States tried to stop the growth of a competitor . The report also provides a brief overview of Huawei ’ s businesses and its innovations after the export control measures . It then examines how the company overcame the restrictions by receiving support from the PRC and by preparing to offset the measures for over six years . In addition , it highlights how U.S. firms have been directly affected , with lost sales of over $ 33 billion between 2021 and 2024 , and exposure to retaliation by the Chinese government due to these export controls . The report also explains why this backlash against U.S. companies matters in the context of U.S.-China techno-economic competition . Finally , the report proposes a framework to address the global rise of Chinese technology companies : ▪ The United States should press more countries to ban Huawei ’ s imports . ▪ Export controls should be applied jointly with allies , or not at all . ▪ Export control measures must consider impacts on U.S. firms and techno-economic power . Huawei is a privately owned company headquartered in Shenzhen , China , with close ties to the Chinese government , and is one of the world ’ s largest technology companies . [ 7 ] The firm reported revenues of $ 124 billion in 2024 , of which information and communication technologies ( ICT ) infrastructure accounted for 43 percent , and consumer markets ( e.g. , smartphones , laptops , wearables , and tablets ) accounted for 39 percent . [ 8 ] Other areas of the company ’ s business include smart grids and energy storage technologies , cloud computing , and smart automotive solutions . Starting around 2018 , U.S. policymakers viewed the growing presence of Huawei within 5G networks as a cybersecurity threat . Policymakers argued that Huawei ’ s technologies could enable the Chinese government to conduct espionage through backdoors . [ 9 ] To address this concern , the U.S. government imposed a de facto import ban on Huawei through a patchwork of measures . ( See table 1 . ) In addition , the global expansion of the company within 5G networks was also assessed as a cybersecurity concern , prompting the government to launch a diplomatic campaign to urge allies and trade partners to follow suit . [ 10 ] Table 1 . De facto import bans—actions to exclude Huawei from U.S. 5G networks ( 2017 to present ) . [ 11 ] Date Measure Instrument December 2017 Prohibition by the U.S. Department of Defense from purchasing products from Huawei or ZTE for covered missions . National Defense Authorization Act ( NDAA ) for fiscal year 2018 May 2018 Ban on retail sales of phones and other telecommunication devices from Huawei and ZTE within U.S. military facilities . U.S. Department of Defense ruling August 2018 Prohibition of all federal procurements from Huawei and ZTE . Additionally , it extended the ban to federal grants , loans , and subsidies , thereby broadening the impact of the restriction to most local government entities . NDAA for fiscal year 2019 May 2019 National emergency declaration due to alleged threats to the national telecommunications supply chain and authorization for the Department of Commerce to ban transactions from organizations considered “ foreign adversaries. ” Executive Order ( EO ) 13873 January 2020 Denial of transactions to purchase equipment from companies categorized as a national security threat to any recipient of federal telecommunications subsidies .

Department of Commerce ’ s final rule implementing EO 13873 May 2025 Prohibition of Chinese labs deemed security risks from testing U.S. electronics . FCC ruling Despite these efforts , many allied countries and nations from the so-called Global South still use Huawei technologies for their 5G infrastructure . ( See figure 1 . ) As of September 2025 , over 3.2 billion people outside China resided in countries that use 5G networks that rely on Huawei equipment , while another 370 million live in countries where Huawei is not banned but is absent from their 5G networks . Huawei remains embedded in the 5G networks of nine U.S. allies—Hungary , Iceland , Italy , South Korea , Spain , the Netherlands , the Philippines , Thailand , and Turkey—and is being phased out from six others : Belgium , France , Germany , Poland , Romania , and the United Kingdom . [ 12 ] Among the rest , Huawei ’ s 5G is banned in 12 countries , and 10 countries have excluded the company without the need for a ban . [ 13 ] Figure 1 . Prevalence of Huawei technologies in 5G infrastructure outside China [ 14 ] In early 2019 , Huawei ’ s alleged business with the Iranian regime , and to a lesser extent with the North Korean regime , led the U.S. government to take action to penalize the company . The efforts taken to punish Huawei caused the U.S. government to lose focus on strengthening America ’ s power in the context of its techno-economic competition with China . As this report describes in further sections , these actions ultimately weakened U.S. competitiveness by hurting American companies . The U.S. government started judicial and administrative actions to sanction Huawei : ▪ Judicial actions . In January 2019 , the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed indictments against Huawei and its CFO , Wanzhou Meng , the daughter of the founder , Ren Zhengfei , for bank fraud , wire fraud , conspiracy , and obstruction of justice . [ 15 ] Meng ’ s case was dismissed with prejudice in 2022 . [ 16 ] The broader criminal case against Huawei is expected to begin in early 2026 , which also includes allegations of its business dealings with the North Korean government . [ 17 ] ▪ Administrative actions . The U.S. Department of Commerce ’ s BIS announced the inclusion of Huawei and its subsidiaries on the Entity List in May 2019 , arguing that the company “ has been involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. ” [ 18 ] The specific accusation that led to its inclusion on the Entity List was evasion of sanctions by doing business with the Iranian government . The Entity List is an executive tool used to target foreign individuals and organizations , subject to specific license requirements for the transaction of certain goods . [ 19 ] U.S. companies had a significant role in Huawei ’ s supply chain by the time it was included on the Entity List , and U.S. government officials attempted to “ kill ” or “ cripple ” the company using this as leverage . [ 20 ] By 2019 , American companies accounted for one-third of Huawei ’ s expenses , with U.S. firms comprising 33 of its top 92 vendor suppliers . [ 21 ] These companies provided essential inputs to Huawei , such as chipsets used in headsets and telecommunications networks , equipment , electronic components , OSs , and semiconductor design software . [ 22 ] However , the U.S. government underestimated the Chinese government ’ s support for Huawei and the company ’ s innovation capabilities to overcome the attempts to damage its supply chain critically . The U.S. government attempted to cripple Huawei by enforcing Entity List-based export controls . The inclusion on the Entity List means a ban on any sale or transfer of U.S. technologies without a license from BIS , including R & D collaboration . The requirement for a license is extended to the export and re-export of all products subject to the Export Administration Regulations ( EAR ) , and all applications for licenses are under a “ presumption of denial , ” meaning the unlikelihood of obtaining exceptions . For Huawei , its inclusion on the Entity List meant that critical inputs from U.S.-based companies would no longer be available , including hardware for its smartphones and other products , as well as software , such as Google Mobile Services . Huawei enjoyed approximately a year and a half of limited breathing room to navigate the 2019 export controls until August 2020 . The restrictions that took immediate effect after its inclusion in the Entity List applied to goods subject to the EAR—U.S.-made products and certain foreign goods manufactured using significant U.S. content . In May 2020 , BIS expanded the jurisdiction for export controls on foreign-made chips fabricated with U.S. equipment ( i.e. , expansion of the Foreign-Produced Direct Product Rule ) , explicitly citing HiSilicon , a semiconductor subsidiary , as an example of Huawei ’ s affiliates targeted by these restrictions . [ 23 ] Moreover , following the company ’ s inclusion on the Entity List , BIS issued successive 90-day temporary general licenses ( TGLs ) that allowed Huawei to continue obtaining certain U.S. technologies , such as software updates . [ 24 ] An August 2020 amendment stopped the TGLs and tightened the Foreign-Produced Direct Product Rule , including foreign-made chips fabricated “ from U.S. technology or software to support the manufacture of indigenous chipsets , ” effectively limiting the company ’ s access to the world ’ s most advanced chips produced by the Taiwanese firm TSMC . [ 25 ] The restrictions after August 2020 included some exceptions , as BIS introduced a permanent authorization for “ cybersecurity research and vulnerability disclosure. ” For instance , in November 2020 , Qualcomm and Intel announced that the U.S. government had granted licenses to sell a limited number of products , including 4G technology for mobile devices ; these licenses were later revoked in May 2024 . [ 26 ] Microsoft received a license allowing it to include Windows in Huawei ’ s laptops , which expired in March 2025 . [ 27 ] Additionally , in September 2022 , BIS granted a permanent authorization to collaborate with Huawei and its subsidiaries on standards setting and dialogue , aiming to prevent the fragmentation of international 5G and Wi-Fi protocols . [ 28 ] In 2022 , the Biden administration announced export controls on advanced semiconductors and equipment to slow the Chinese semiconductor industry as a whole—i.e. , not targeting specific companies . [ 29 ] These measures led some American companies to redesign some of their products to meet U.S. government standards . A notable example is Nvidia ’ s H20 chip , which is a second-tier version of its advanced data center chips designed to meet the 2022 restrictions . [ 30 ] The U.S. government later banned the export of the H20 chip in January 2025—which boosted Huawei 's Ascend 910C chips in the Chinese market almost immediately—and later lifted the ban in July of that year . [ 31 ] Export Controls During the 1980s U.S.-Japan Technological Competition The United States was once able to halt the growth of entire industries that threatened American global leadership , such as the U.S.-Japan technology rivalry in the 1980s , particularly in the semiconductor sector . But the conditions that led the United States to stop the Japanese semiconductor industry ’ s growth do not apply to today ’ s U.S.-China techno-economic competition . The rapid rise of the Japanese economy during the 1980s was viewed as a threat by some U.S. policymakers . Japanese semiconductor , automotive , and consumer electronics companies were quickly gaining global market share , while Japan ’ s economy was largely inaccessible to American competitors . In 1985 , the United States launched a Section 301 investigation—an instrument of the U.S. Trade Act used to impose trade remedies in response to unfair trade practices—against Japan ’ s semiconductor and electronics industries based on allegations of dumping and currency manipulation , leading to a 100 percent tariff on Japanese electronics . [ 32 ] Additionally , in 1986 , both countries reached an agreement on semiconductors : Japan committed not to compete against the United States through dumping and allowed U.S. semiconductors to capture a 20 percent share of its domestic market . [ 33 ] Some experts consider these measures the “ start of the decline for Japan ’ s semiconductor industry. ” [ 34 ] Japan ’ s semiconductor industry grew rapidly during the 1980s , and it temporarily held the majority of the global market between 1986 and 1992 . [ 35 ] ( See figure 2 . ) The United States was able to regain its global market share through a mix of measures : addressing Japanese unfair trade practices , implementing industrial policies to support the American semiconductor industry , and capitalizing on shifts in global demand toward microprocessors and logic chips . A notable example of how the United States treated this as a public-private effort is the Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology ( SEMATECH ) consortium , created in 1987 by 14 U.S. semiconductor firms , which received $ 870 million from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) . [ 36 ] An example of the United States sanctioning a specific Japanese company is the “ Toshiba-Kongsberg scandal ” in 1986 , when it was revealed that Toshiba Machine , a subsidiary of the Japanese electronics manufacturer Toshiba Corporation , had sold sensitive technologies to the Soviet Union ( USSR ) . [ 37 ] Toshiba ’ s tools , combined with those of the Norwegian weapons manufacturer Kongsberg—a company that was also supplying the USSR—were used to reduce the detection of nuclear submarines . [ 38 ] Toshiba Machine was sanctioned by the United States in 1988 , which banned Toshiba Corp. and Toshiba Machine from public procurement , along with certain Toshiba Machine products , for three years . [ 39 ] Figure 2 : U.S. and Japanese global semiconductor market share , by revenues , 1984–2019 [ 40 ] The context and effectiveness of the U.S. government ’ s measures against Japanese companies in the 1980s differ from the ongoing U.S.-China techno-economic rivalry , as summarized in table 2 . Table 2 : Summary of the U.S.-Japan ( 1980s ) vs. U.S.-China ( present day ) tech rivalry Context Similarities Differences Geopolitical Both represent contests between the United States and a rising economy . Japan was ( and remains ) a U.S. ally ; China is a strategic rival . Japan cooperated ; China retaliates and pushes decoupling . Trade Large bilateral trade deficits drove/drive tensions . Today ’ s globalized supply chains make restrictions harder to enforce and less effective . Industrial policy Semiconductors were and remain central to competition . The U.S. responded with industrial policies promoting the semiconductor industry ( SEMATECH in 1987 ; CHIPS Act in 2022 ) . U.S.–China rivalry spans more sectors , including advanced and military technologies . Japan ’ s security risks were product-specific , with few IP theft concerns ; contrary to the current concerns about Chinese technology firms . Firm-level support Both relied/rely on “ national champions ” ( Toshiba , Huawei ) that benefited/benefit from state support and protected markets . Japanese firms are private conglomerates ( keiretsu ) . Chinese firms are state-owned or closely tied to the CCP . Before the export controls , Huawei and its subsidiaries held a significant global market share in several of their businesses . Huawei has not fully recovered its revenues before the restrictions ; however , the company has demonstrated resilience by regaining market share , mainly relying on the Chinese market . Some examples are listed below : ▪ Lower market share on smartphone shipments than before the export controls , but a higher participation in the Chinese market . The company had a 20 percent global market share in smartphone shipments by 2019 , which dropped to “ virtually zero ” after the restrictions , although by December 2024 , it had increased to 4 percent . [ 41 ] As of April 2025 , Huawei was virtually tied with Xiaomi as the most popular mobile phone company in China , with approximately 18 percent market share . [ 42 ] ▪ Similar market share in ICT infrastructure before and after export controls . Huawei currently holds at least 31 percent of the global revenue for radio access network ( RAN ) products , slightly higher than its 30 percent market share in 2016 . [ 43 ] ▪ Regaining market share in smartphone chipsets . The market share of smartphone chipsets from HiSilicon , Huawei ’ s semiconductor design subsidiary , peaked in the second quarter of 2020 at 16 percent , making it the third-largest supplier worldwide . However , it dropped to zero in the second quarter of 2022 and rebounded to 4 percent in the first quarter of 2025 . [ 44 ] After its inclusion in the Entity List , Huawei is focusing on launching products that replace those previously supplied by U.S. companies . Notably , the company claims to have developed “ an ecosystem entirely independent of the United States. ” [ 45 ] One of the pillars of this independent ecosystem is Huawei ’ s in-house built OS , HarmonyOS , which was initially developed as a “ backup plan ” in case of U.S. restrictions ; the company now expects it to become “ a third mobile operating system for the world. ” [ 46 ] HarmonyOS is also compatible with computers , and there are reports that Huawei is rolling out its laptops with this system instead of Microsoft ’ s Windows . [ 47 ] Huawei is focusing on launching products that replace those previously supplied by U.S. companies , and it claims to have developed “ an ecosystem entirely independent of the United States. ” Cutting off Android and Windows OS helped create and accelerate the deployment of Huawei ’ s OS . HarmonyOS runs on over 1 billion devices , and supports smartphones , laptops , tablets , and over 1,000 peripheral devices such as printers . [ 48 ] Huawei is exploring using HarmonyOS in other developments , such as microsatellites—and with its new generation , HarmonyOS NEXT , the firm expects to complete the decoupling from Western-led OSs . [ 49 ] According to Chinese media , HarmonyOS was developed with the collaboration of 20 research institutes and 10,000 engineers , and the effort has registered over 2,700 patents . Some Western companies operating in China , such as BMW , have already partnered with Huawei to incorporate its OS into their next-generation vehicles . [ 50 ] The effort to build an indigenous OS aligns closely with the PRC ’ s goals of technological self-reliance and challenges Western dominance in global markets . Android and Apple ’ s iOS account for nearly 99 percent of the worldwide smartphone market , and Apple , Google , and Microsoft together account for more than 90 percent of the laptop OSs ’ share . [ 51 ] Moreover , OpenHarmony , the software upon which HarmonyOS is based , is managed by the OpenAtom Foundation , a Chinese government-controlled organization . [ 52 ] Huawei is also investing in reducing its reliance on foreign chipmaking technologies . The company claims that in 2023 it was able to replace more than 13,000 components and redesign over 4,000 circuit boards . [ 53 ] HiSilicon designed a 7 nanometer ( nm ) chip that compensates for its lower computing power by utilizing HarmonyOS and began deploying this chip in its devices in 2023 . [ 54 ] Huawei ’ s AI chip , Ascend 910d , is expected to perform on par with Nvidia ’ s H100 , one of the company ’ s most advanced products , yet at nearly 60–70 percent of its cost . [ 55 ] However , some reports estimate that Huawei lags significantly behind Western chipmakers , such as Nvidia and AMD , and will struggle to compete outside China . [ 56 ] Reports suggest that Huawei can substitute Nvidia ’ s H20 chip with the Ascend 920 model , announced in April 2025 . [ 57 ] It is expected that Huawei will become China 's top AI chipmaker by 2026 , with the opening of three new plants . [ 58 ] Despite this , the company will not have the necessary scale to meet demand in the Chinese market within the next year . [ 59 ] In addition , Nvidia reported halting H20 chip production in August 2025 due to significant pushback from the Chinese government , and reports suggest that Chinese technology companies have been banned from acquiring it since September 2025 due to cybersecurity concerns . [ 60 ] The company is also opening new product lines , directly competing against U.S. firms . For example , Huawei ’ s smart driving solutions have been implemented in at least half a million cars , and some analysts suggest its technology is superior to Tesla ’ s . [ 61 ] The Huawei MateBook X Pro and Huawei ’ s Watch D also offer features and specifications that are often considered equal to or superior to those of Western competitors . [ 62 ] The export controls did not take into account the Chinese government ’ s efforts to secure the company ’ s survival . There is precedent for the Chinese government intervening to rescue the company . Ren Zhengfei , Huawei ’ s founder and president , stated that “ Huawei would no longer exist ” without protectionist policies to shield it from foreign competitors during its internationalization efforts in the 2000s . [ 63 ] At that time , Chinese-backed loans , such as those from the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China , aided Huawei ’ s international expansion , allowing the company to outbid competitors and adopt a “ vacuum-cleaner approach … just sucking up the market. ” [ 64 ] Over the 2010s , Huawei and state-owned ZTE artificially gained market share from Ericsson and Nokia in telecommunications equipment through direct support from the Chinese government , as well as indirect support such as restricting foreign companies ’ access to the expanding Chinese market . [ 65 ] Following the U.S. export controls in 2019 , Huawei continues to receive support from the PRC through financial support , direct procurement from state-owned Chinese companies , and a continued preferential treatment as a “ national champion ” for strategic national initiatives . Huawei ’ s success stands on the shoulders of Chinese innovation mercantilism . By 2019 , Huawei had received $ 75 billion in state support since its establishment , including $ 1.6 billion in grants , $ 46.3 billion in credit facilities , $ 25 billion in tax breaks , and $ 2 billion in subsidized land purchases . [ 66 ] This helped the company gain market share , particularly in the global telecommunications equipment market . The company has also benefited from various other types of government support , including its role as a recipient of Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) projects , which helped the company expand its global footprint and build the necessary connections to navigate restrictions . [ 67 ] The Chinese government has implemented various practices to support Huawei and other national champions , including protecting the domestic market , undervaluing the currency , promoting exports , and ignoring intellectual property ( IP ) theft . [ 68 ] The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation ( ITIF ) has a longstanding record of reporting on how the PRC has subsidized Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications companies , such as ZTE . Huawei ’ s and ZTE ’ s global market share , primarily accumulated during the 2010s , was a direct result of China ’ s mercantilist policies and programs , such as closing China ’ s market to foreign companies , thereby securing a sizable customer base . [ 69 ] A 2020 ITIF study found that if Ericsson and Nokia had captured Huawei ’ s and ZTE ’ s equivalent market shares , the world would have seen a 20 percent increase in telecommunications equipment R & D investments and 75 additional essential 5G patents . [ 70 ] Hence , Chinese state support for Huawei not only helps advance China ’ s agenda of techno-economic dominance at the expense of Western incumbents , but also undermines overall global innovation . Following its inclusion in the Entity List in 2019 , Huawei continues to receive support from the PRC . For example , the company has received more than 215 billion yuan ( $ 30 billion ) from the central and Shenzhen governments to acquire two chip plants and to build at least three others . [ 71 ] The PRC ’ s continued support is reflected in several additional ways : ▪ Favorable financial support to mitigate the effects of the export controls . HONOR , a former Huawei subsidiary , is a budget-brand smartphone whose business was heavily affected by U.S. restrictions , as it relied on U.S. semiconductors for its hardware and had access to the Google Play Store for its software . [ 72 ] HONOR was acquired in 2020 for 100 billion yuan ( $ 15.2 billion ) by a consortium of private and state-backed investors . [ 73 ] In this transaction , the Chinese government acted as the “ investor of first resort , ” allowing Huawei to divest from an asset subject to export controls under its ownership , while the PRC government secured the continuation of production for a company that , after the acquisition , was able to keep importing foreign chips . [ 74 ] ▪ Direct procurement from state-owned Chinese companies . The PRC has consistently favored China ’ s national champions through the procurement of public agencies or state-owned companies . For example , in 2021 , China Mobile , a state-owned Chinese telecommunications company , announced that Huawei would be the vendor for 60 percent of 5G network station contracts . [ 75 ] ( ZTE acquired nearly 30 percent , while Western competitors such as Ericsson and Nokia received the remaining few contracts . ) China Mobile allocated Huawei 52 percent of a $ 1.1 billion contract for 5G network deployment between 2023 and 2024 . [ 76 ] ( Ericsson and Nokia received 13 percent of the resources ; notably , another Chinese state-owned company , Datang Mobile , received awards in addition to ZTE . ) What ITIF stated in 2020 remains valid in 2025 : “ The only reason a non-Chinese firm is allowed to gain 5G market share is to continue the illusion of an open competitive market , and to give the Chinese government leverage over European governments that seek to limit Huawei deployment in Europe . If the EU threatens to take strong action against unfair Chinese practices , the Chinese government can retaliate by threatening to completely exclude European providers. ” [ 77 ] ▪ Continued preferential treatment as a “ national champion ” for strategic national initiatives . Huawei has been one of the primary beneficiaries of China ’ s industrial policies aimed at promoting the country ’ s strategic industry upgrades . For instance , the 2023 expansion of the semiconductor R & D tax incentive served as a de facto subsidy for Huawei and HiSilicon ( Huawei ’ s semiconductor design subsidiary ) , among others , since semiconductor R & D expenditure can yield up to a 220 percent deduction from the company ’ s taxable income . [ 78 ] In 2023 , the PRC designated Huawei—along with Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment ( AMEC ) , Naura , and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation ( SMIC ) —as targets for increased governmental support for semiconductors , without requiring the demonstration of performance objectives . [ 79 ] ( To be sure , semiconductor tax credits can be legitimate tools for nations to use to promote their semiconductor industries , so long as those tax credits are made available equally to companies from all countries competing in a nation ’ s market . ) Since 2012 , Huawei has shifted toward greater reliance on the Chinese domestic market to buffer against restrictions , invested heavily in R & D , developed capabilities to produce in-house critical hardware and software , and stockpiled resources to survive the first year after restrictions . ITIF noted in 2020 that export controls were “ shooting U.S. exporters in the foot , ” as they went beyond protecting the U.S. telecommunications networks for cybersecurity reasons , limited U.S. company exports , and incentivized Huawei “ to produce its own inputs , including computer chips. ” [ 81 ] This assessment proved to be accurate . Moreover , the export controls overlooked that Huawei had prepared for a restrictions scenario for over six years before the company was added to the Entity List in 2019 . Notably , a 2012 U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence special report revealed the company ’ s unfair practices and its ties with the People ’ s Liberation Army ( PLA ) acted as an early warning . [ 82 ] Since 2012 , Huawei has shifted toward greater reliance on the Chinese domestic market to buffer against restrictions , invested heavily in R & D , developed capabilities to produce in-house critical hardware and software , and stockpiled resources to survive the first year after restrictions . A year after the 2012 House report , Huawei initiated an aggressive public relations campaign in the United States to improve its image . When the campaign did not lessen the scrutiny over the company ’ s practices and cybersecurity concerns , it officially declared that it was “ not interested in the U.S. market anymore , ” noting that its U.S. market sales were only $ 1 billion . [ 83 ] ( This ignored the fact that the company relied heavily on U.S. technology components for all its operations . ) While the 2000s were a decade of international expansion for Huawei , the company reversed this trend in the subsequent decade . Before the 2008 global financial crisis , Huawei ’ s global expansion led to a significant increase in its non-Chinese revenues , jumping from 21 percent in 2005 to 75 percent in 2008 . As the shock from the crisis led the company to increase its share in Chinese markets by 15 percentage points from 2008 to 2009 , Huawei slowly recovered its income from non-Chinese markets by 2011 . However , since 2012 , Huawei has significantly expanded its presence and increasingly relied on revenues from China . By 2019 , China represented 59 percent of Huawei ’ s revenues , and in its latest 2024 annual report , China provided 71 percent of revenues . Figure 3 : Huawei ’ s revenues from China as a share of total revenues [ 84 ] While revenues from China have increased in relative terms for the company since 2012 , revenues from the rest of the world also rose in the years leading up to the U.S. restrictions . As shown in figure 4 , Huawei ’ s global revenues increased 2.5 times between 2011 and 2020 , the years when revenues peaked . However , revenues generated in China grew sixfold during this period , whereas revenues from non-Chinese markets rose by 78 percent . Revenues from China have served as a buffer to offset the impact of U.S. export controls . During the first year after them , revenues from China increased by 12 percent , offsetting the 14 percent decline in non-Chinese markets , which enabled Huawei to report an overall year-over-year increase . In the following years , revenues from China bounced back rapidly . Between 2019 and 2024 , revenues from China increased by 4 percent , while revenues from non-Chinese markets declined by 7 percent . Figure 4 : Huawei ’ s revenues by region ( billion CNY , 2024 prices ) [ 85 ] Revenues from China have served as a buffer to offset the impact of U.S. export controls . One example of how the Chinese market has served as a buffer is Huawei ’ s market share for smartphone devices . The company once dominated the Chinese smartphone market , accounting for 37 percent and 38 percent of total sales in 2019 and 2020 , respectively . As the export controls affected the firm ’ s production , by 2021 , this market share had fallen to approximately 5 percent . Considering that HONOR spun off from Huawei through the previously described state-supported acquisition , the comparison of post-restrictions market share should involve both companies . In this context , despite a challenging 2021 , the combined market share of Huawei and HONOR in China averaged 29 percent for the 2022 to 2024 period . ( See figure 5 . ) As of 2025 , Huawei ’ s market share in this sector has virtually tied with Xiaomi , making it one of the two most dominant ICT companies in China . Figure 5 : Huawei ’ s market share in China for smartphone sales [ 86 ] Huawei outperformed all its competitors in terms of R & D investment before the U.S. restrictions . Between 2013 ( the first full year after the October 2012 House report on Huawei ) and 2020 , Huawei increased its real R & D expenditure by more than threefold , surpassing that of any other peer company , as shown in figure 6 . Regardless of whether this investment—which exceeded that of the rest of the industry—was motivated by global expansion or by the fact that Huawei executives were indeed accounting for restrictions risks , in practice , these years of R & D overspending allowed the company to build a knowledge base to confront the restrictions challenge . Figure 6 : Real R & D expenditure growth by company ( indexed ; 2013 = 100 ) [ 87 ] Growth in Huawei ’ s R & D expenditures declined after the restrictions , yet it still set a record for the company in 2023 and 2024 . [ 88 ] Huawei ’ s efforts to develop ( or catch up with ) frontier technologies have not diminished . One way to approximate this is by examining R & D intensity , which considers the company ’ s R & D expenditure as a share of total revenues for a given year . Huawei had historically lagged behind in corporate R & D compared to competitors such as Ericsson and Nokia . [ 89 ] However , as figure 7 shows , U.S. restrictions forced the company to increase its R & D intensity to an average of 20 percent between 2019 and 2023 , outperforming all competitors except Intel ( which competes with Huawei only in one of Huawei ’ s businesses : semiconductors ) . Figure 7 : R & D intensity by company ( R & D expenditure as a share of net sales ) [ 90 ] Huawei took advantage of the TGL granted after its designation to the Entity List to release HarmonyOS . Additionally , Huawei increased its number of R & D personnel since the U.S. restrictions were imposed , hiring more than 17,000 employees in this field between 2019 and 2024 . ( See figure 8 . ) While Huawei ’ s R & D staff accounted for 45 percent of the total staff count during the five years preceding the restrictions ( 2014–2018 ) , this proportion rose to an average of 55 percent in the five years following the U.S. inclusion of the company on the Entity List ( 2020–2024 ) . There is no available information about the specific units or research projects to which these additional R & D researchers have been assigned . Figure 8 : Number of R & D employees and R & D personnel as a share of total employees for Huawei [ 91 ] The export control for software , in practice , began in August 2020 after BIS stopped granting the TGL . [ 92 ] This meant that Huawei would lose access to all non-open-source dealings , such as licensing for Google ’ s Android OS , Google ’ s Play Store app ecosystem , and any other software-related business with U.S.-headquartered companies . Huawei sold its handsets with Android Open Source Project in China ( since Google ’ s services were blocked in the country due to censorship ) and the Google-certified Android OS for the rest of the world as the integrated OS . Microsoft enjoyed a license until March 2025 , allowing it to include Windows OS in Huawei ’ s laptops . [ 93 ] Huawei took advantage of the TGL granted after its designation to the Entity List to release HarmonyOS in August 2019 . The company had previously explored using another OS instead of Android , such as Microsoft ’ s Windows Phone OS or Samsung ’ s Tizen in 2014 . [ 94 ] Huawei explicitly built its in-house OS in anticipation of potential U.S. restrictions—two months before the restrictions , a spokesperson stated , “ Huawei does have backup systems but only for use in extenuating circumstances. ” [ 95 ] Some reports indicate that the company has been prepared for “ worst-case scenarios ” since the 2012 House report . [ 96 ] Evidence suggests that the firm was preparing for an indigenous OS as early as 2013–2014 . For example , LiteOS , an OS for real-time Internet-of-Things devices , was launched in 2015 . [ 97 ] Some of the functions of LiteOS used to build HarmonyOS and its open-source version , OpenHarmony , are described as its direct predecessors . [ 98 ] Similarly , the technology enabling cross-device tasks and efficient resource allocation scheduling for the OS patent application dates back to May 2015 , suggesting that at least part of the research was conducted in 2014 or earlier . [ 99 ] Huawei developed semiconductor capabilities to achieve self-sufficiency in the event of U.S. restrictions . To achieve this goal , the company took three clear actions : invested in its main chip design subsidiary ( HiSilicon ) , began working with companies that have complementary strengths in the semiconductor supply chain , and created incentives to develop an ecosystem within China through an investment platform . HiSilicon , fully owned by and originating as a spin-off of Huawei in the 2000s , served as the cornerstone of Huawei ’ s backup plans for chips . The day after the export controls were announced in May 2019 , HiSilicon ’ s CEO sent a letter warning that the company had been preparing a “ spare tire ” for the survival of Huawei . [ 100 ] HiSilicon provided Huawei with the organizational and staffing capabilities to develop physical components that could replace U.S. technologies . By 2012 , HiSilicon had developed at least 120 chip designs and distributed at least 150 million chips . [ 101 ] HiSilicon has been developing chips branded as Kirin since 2014 and helped design the world ’ s first 7 nm chipset commercialized with 5G support , Kirin 980 , in 2018 in partnership with TSMC . [ 102 ] HiSilicon produced more than $ 7 billion worth of chips during the period before the 2019 restrictions . [ 103 ] The second action taken was to collaborate with companies that have complementary capabilities . For example , in 2015 , Huawei announced a joint venture with SMIC ( a partially state-owned Chinese company ) , Imec ( a Belgian research consortium ) , and Qualcomm ( a U.S. semiconductor company ) called SMIC Advanced Technology Research & Development ( Shanghai ) Corporation . This joint venture , majority owned by SMIC , focused on R & D to develop 14 nm semiconductor technology for mass production by 2020 . [ 104 ] SMIC announced the start of volume production for the 14 nm chip in late 2019 , and the first commercialization took place in 2020 with HiSilicon ’ s 14 nm Kirin 710A chip . [ 105 ] Finally , Huawei sought to build a local ecosystem of suppliers to strengthen China ’ s self-sufficiency in semiconductors . In 2019 , before Huawei ’ s inclusion on the Entity List , the company launched Hubble , a venture capital subsidiary designed as an investment vehicle for semiconductor startups , with a registered capital exceeding $ 100 million . Before the establishment of Hubble , Huawei had maintained a practice of not investing in third-party companies . [ 106 ] To date , Hubble has invested in at least 100 startups . [ 107 ] For example , it is an investor in companies developing key semiconductor fabrication processes , such as Focuslight Technologies ( a photolithography equipment maker ) , Suzhou Everbright Photonics ( a gallium-nitride chipmaker ) , and Xuzhou Chemicals ( which develops photoresist technologies used in lithography ) . [ 108 ] Hubble is currently being used to further promote Huawei ’ s ecosystem by funding startups that would be locked into it , for instance , by investing in humanoid robots that can integrate the company ’ s new developments in chips ( Huawei ’ s Ascend AI chips ) , large language models ( Pangu ) , and HarmonyOS . [ 109 ] The cumulative congressional and executive actions raising concerns about Huawei during late 2017 onward allowed the company to take actions to mitigate potential U.S. measures against it . For example , Huawei ’ s inventories of raw materials expanded by more than 86 percent from 2017 to 2018 , and the company has kept a high level of stockpiles of raw materials since the restrictions relative to other inventories . ( See figure 9 . ) These raw materials include electronic components and sub-assemblies used in manufacturing telecommunication equipment and consumer devices , as well as large orders of the 7 nm Tiangang core chips , manufactured by TSMC using U.S. wafer fabrication equipment and supplying Huawei until the end of the TGL . [ 110 ] These inventory levels allowed the company to effectively boost its revenues during the first year after it was added to the Entity List , in addition to other measures such as issuing bonds in the Chinese market for over $ 800 million to increase liquidity and reduce its financial reliance on foreign markets . [ 111 ] Figure 9 : Huawei ’ s raw materials as a share of total inventories [ 112 ] The U.S. actions against Huawei served as an incentive for the company to accelerate its decoupling from U.S. technologies . U.S. exports to Huawei exceeded $ 11 billion when the firm was added to the Entity List . [ 113 ] Without those inputs , it created a “ void ” in Huawei ’ s supply chain that was mostly filled by Huawei ’ s in-house processes or Chinese technologies . Restrictions against the company harmed U.S. businesses by reducing sales of former Huawei suppliers and triggering retaliation from the PRC against them . ITIF estimates that restrictions on doing business with Huawei caused U.S. companies to lose at least $ 33 billion in sales between 2021 and 2024 . This estimation is based on two main priors . Before U.S. restrictions , Huawei spent roughly 33 percent of its operating costs on American suppliers . [ 114 ] Following the August 2020 amendment to terminate the TGLs , BIS authorized a limited number of export licenses from 2021 to 2024 ; however , this information is not publicly available . [ 115 ] Anecdotal evidence suggests that Huawei purchased between 5 and 10 percent of its operating costs from U.S. firms during this period ; ITIF conservatively estimates that share to be 15 percent . [ 116 ] To model what would have happened without the export controls , ITIF combined two different types of alternatives for Huawei , creating a total of four different estimations , summarized in figure 10 . The first case involves trying to infer what Huawei ’ s growth would be without U.S. restrictions . To do this , ITIF modeled two scenarios : the “ current sales ” scenario ( using existing data on Huawei ’ s performance ) and a “ no export controls scenario , ” which assumes that Huawei ’ s sales would follow the same pattern as the average of its main Western competitors ( Alphabet , Apple , Ericsson , Nokia , and Microsoft ) from 2021–2024 . The second consideration for Huawei in this analysis is whether the company was already on a path to decouple from U.S. technologies , regardless of U.S. actions . To explore this , ITIF modeled two cases : a base case wherein U.S. firms accounted for roughly 33 percent of Huawei ’ s operating costs for all years ( business-as-usual suppliers , or “ BAU suppliers , ” scenario ) and a “ decoupling scenario , ” assuming Huawei would fully decouple from U.S. technologies by 2027—the 100th anniversary of the PLA . Figure 10 . Lost sales to U.S. suppliers due to export controls against Huawei between 2021 and 2024 ( billions ) [ 117 ] Sales from U.S. firms to Huawei helped sustain American market share in key technology products and funded R & D projects , preventing China from capturing that share . At the industry level , Huawei often did not represent a significant portion of the revenues of American advanced manufacturing companies . ( See table 3 . ) However , these sales helped U.S. companies reach the necessary volumes and margins to invest in innovation , ultimately maintaining competitiveness and market share . Restrictions against Huawei directly harmed U.S. businesses by reducing sales of former Huawei suppliers and triggering retaliation from the PRC against them . The restrictions also had a secondary effect on American companies supplying Huawei . Many of them reported in their annual statements that U.S. action negatively impacted the overall demand for their products . For example , Analog Devices Inc. , an American semiconductor company , reported in its 2020 annual report that restrictions were “ causing our current or potential customers to amass large inventories of our products , replace our products with products from another supplier that is not subject to the export restrictions , or focus on building indigenous semiconductor capacity to reduce reliance on U.S. suppliers. ” [ 118 ] Table 4 : Examples of U.S. advanced manufacturing companies affected by the export controls [ 119 ] Company Example of What It Supplied to Huawei Relevant Financial Information Analog Devices Inc. Chips used in radio systems for 5G telecommunications networks Sales to Huawei represented between 2 and 3 percent of total sales by 2020 . Broadcom Wireless communication chips for smartphones and other devices Huawei represented 4 percent of Broadcom ’ s revenues in 2019 , or $ 900 million . Cadence Electronic design automation software ( EDA ) , also provided to HiSilicon In May 2025 , the U.S. government imposed new export controls on EDA sales to Chinese companies . Intel License to ship laptop central processors to Huawei in 2020 ( revoked in 2024 ) When the 2024 license was revoked , Intel maintained its revenue expectation for the year , but “ below the midpoint ” between $ 12.5 billion and $ 13.5 billion . Micron Technology Dynamic Random Access Memory ( DRAM ) Huawei represented 13 percent of revenues by February 2019 . Qorvo Radio frequency ( RF ) supplier for Huawei handsets and base stations Huawei accounted for 13 percent of 2019 revenues , 10 percent in 2020 , and 5 percent in 2021 , after which it stopped reporting significant sales . Qualcomm License in 2020 to sell older 4G chips to Huawei ( revoked in 2024 ) Between October 2023 and May 2024 , revenues from Huawei represented $ 560 million ( 1.4 percent for the fiscal year ending in September 2024 ) Texas Instruments Analog chips for Huawei smartphones and telecom equipment Sales to Huawei represented between 3 and 4 percent of total sales in 2019 . Giving Away Market Share to a Foreign Competitor : The Case of Teradyne Teradyne is an American manufacturing company specializing in Automated Test Equipment ( ATE ) for the semiconductor industry . ATE plays a critical role in semiconductor manufacturing , as it guarantees essential quality controls during the different stages of the process . Teradyne , along with its Japanese competitor Advantest , together account for roughly 80–90 percent of the global market for semiconductor testers in many segments . [ 120 ] Teradyne is also a global leader in advanced robotics through its subsidiary Universal Robots . [ 121 ] As the export controls against Huawei limited the supply of U.S. technologies to the firm , but were not coordinated with allies , Teradyne was impacted , but its Japanese competitor was not . Thus , Huawei replaced Teradyne ’ s inputs with Advantest ’ s , giving up global market share . [ 122 ] Advantest ’ s global market share for semiconductor testers grew from 43 percent in 2020 to 58 percent in 2024 , while Teradyne ’ s declined roughly in a similar , inverse proportion . [ 123 ] The restrictions have also harmed Teradyne ’ s ability to keep investing in innovation capabilities . The company observed two consecutive years of revenue decline , from $ 3.7 billion in 2021 to $ 2.7 billion in 2023 . As of September 2025 , it had not recovered its pre-restriction sales . This revenue loss has impacted the firm ’ s innovation capabilities . Figure 11 shows the R & D expenditure for Advantest and Teradyne , indexed in 2020 , when restrictions began . After the restrictions came into effect for ATE products , Advantest was able to expand its R & D expenditure by roughly 50 percent , while Teradyne observed a decrease in real R & D expenditure . Figure 11 . R & D expenditure ( indexed ; 2020 = 100 ) . [ 124 ] U.S. restrictions also compelled American companies to cancel their contracts with Huawei , such as the earlier removal of Google ’ s Play Store from Huawei devices . This meant that Huawei ’ s wearables could not be updated to meet Google ’ s security and development standards . [ 125 ] A similar pattern occurred with Microsoft and its laptop OS , the Windows series . Windows ’ license to Huawei expired in March 2025 , giving the Chinese company enough time to incorporate HarmonyOS into its laptops . [ 126 ] After March 2025 , reports indicate that Huawei is only rolling out laptops using its in-house-built OS , HarmonyOS , threatening Microsoft ’ s market share . [ 127 ] While there has not been a formal retaliation from the Chinese government against the United States due to Huawei ’ s inclusion on the Entity List , the PRC has since taken actions that effectively serve as a response to the restrictions . A few months after the restrictions were imposed in 2019 , Cisco executives declared that the company was “ uninvited ” to compete in bids by Chinese state-owned companies . [ 128 ] Thus , Cisco was de facto barred from continuing to sell telecommunications infrastructure to Chinese carriers . ( Cisco still sells equipment to other Chinese companies , such as electric vehicle makers . ) [ 129 ] In December 2019 , the PRC instructed all government agencies to phase out foreign-made technologies , including hardware and software , by 2022 . [ 130 ] This measure was directly targeted at reducing the market share of American firms , such as Dell , HP , and Microsoft , while being functional to the PRC ’ s goal of technological self-sufficiency . Likewise , local governments in China , such as Shenzhen , started promoting the adoption of HarmonyOS as their primary system , under the “ Shenzhen Action Plan for Supporting the Development of Native HarmonyOS Open Source Applications in 2024 , ” which is seen as a basis for a nation-wide initiative to phase out American OS . [ 131 ] In addition , the PRC established its version of the Entity List in May 2019 , called the “ Unreliable Entity List , ” with a justification similar to that of the American version . [ 132 ] This tool provides the PRC with a legal basis to target retaliatory measures against specific companies , primarily American ones . The Unreliable Entity List uniquely includes American companies , and it has been utilized by the Chinese government as a “ bargaining tool ” during ongoing trade negotiations , highlighting the retaliatory nature of the measure . [ 133 ] The U.S.–China techno-economic rivalry plays out across every strategic sector , including those in which Huawei competes with American firms for global market share . As ITIF has reported , China is rapidly catching up with the United States in robotics , electronic displays , and artificial intelligence , and it lags behind in machine tools and semiconductors . [ 134 ] These are all critical links in Huawei ’ s supply chain . Because U.S. policy has shaped Huawei ’ s innovation path , its continued growth erodes America ’ s competitive edge . The business opportunity loss for American firms doing business with Huawei ultimately matters for the U.S. public interest for three reasons : 1 . The acceleration of Huawei ’ s decoupling from using U.S. technologies impacts American global market share in key products , such as OSs . 2 . The loss of revenues from doing business with Huawei undermines American competitiveness , as it limits U.S. firms ’ ability to reinvest in R & D and advanced production . [ 135 ] 3 . The acceleration of Huawei ’ s decoupling from U.S. technologies is leading to a lock-in of consumers to products within an ecosystem that privileges Chinese standards and supply chains . U.S. technology companies are now in a weaker position to lead globally due to Huawei ’ s accelerated decoupling . As Nokia and Ericsson were ultimately unable to offset the unfair competition against Huawei and ZTE in 5G , this pattern will likely repeat for the cases of HarmonyOS , the new generation of Huawei ’ s wearables competing against American firms , or both . The result is likely to be a decline in global market share for companies such as Google and Microsoft . The rationale used by the U.S. government ’ s actions against Huawei is a legacy of an earlier era , when America could impose sanctions without significantly harming its competitiveness and could hinder the production capabilities of its adversaries . This framework is outdated , as global supply chains have become increasingly complex and Chinese techno-economic power has reached , in some cases , unassailable levels . The United States needs a realistic approach . The fact that the United States is incapable of crippling a company such as Huawei does not preclude the need to take actions against Chinese mercantilism . A modern framework should pair import bans for cybersecurity reasons with limited , targeted export controls on advanced technologies . Some of the measures that U.S. policymakers should consider for this modern framework include the following : ▪ Press more countries to ban Huawei ’ s imports . In 2020 , ITIF recommended that the U.S. government urge its allies to exclude Huawei and ZTE from their markets , particularly in the telecommunications network infrastructure and equipment sector , to counter the companies ’ artificial competitiveness resulting from Chinese support and the lack of opportunities for rivals to access the Chinese domestic market . [ 136 ] This assessment has not changed . Despite foreign policy ’ s efforts across multiple U.S. administrations , Huawei remains in many European markets—even as its predatory practices have particularly harmed Ericsson and Nokia . Some allies are phasing out Huawei from their 5G network . Germany , for example , plans to phase out Huawei from core 5G networks by 2026 and from the radio and management layers by 2029 . [ 137 ] However , nine U.S. allies—Hungary , Iceland , Italy , South Korea , Spain , the Netherlands , the Philippines , Thailand , and Turkey—continue to use Huawei in their 5G infrastructure without a plan to phase out the company entirely . The U.S. government needs to reverse course on its go-it-alone approach to competitiveness and start to bring in a “ coalition of the willing ” that understands the threat to the West from Chinese national power industry predation and is willing to take collective steps in self-defense . One such step should be to ban further sales of Huawei telecom equipment . A modern framework should pair import bans for cybersecurity reasons with limited , targeted export controls on advanced technologies . ▪ Export controls should be applied jointly with allies , or not at all . Export controls , in part , were ineffective because regulatory loopholes allowed Huawei to fully offset American inputs of the same cost and quality as those of U.S. allies , including Japan . As this report shows , blanket export controls on Huawei have undermined American competitiveness in markets where the company has other substitutes , such as the case of ATE for chipmaking tests . This experience demonstrates that unilateral export controls , besides being ineffective and harmful to U.S. companies , actually work to the advantage of American allies . ▪ Export control measures must consider impacts on U.S. firms and techno-economic power . For decades , U.S. foreign policy makers and mavens were willing to spend U.S. techno-economic power to achieve foreign policy goals , such as sanctioning a country we wanted to punish , such as Iran . America can no longer afford such spending of its “ technology capital. ” Huawei ’ s experience demonstrates that export controls are detrimental to the United States in both absolute and relative terms : they reduced the resources available for U.S. companies to invest in R & D and innovation , and helped shape Huawei as a competitor in new products , such as OSs , which now threaten U.S. dominance in this global market . It is time for an intellectual and operational reset . U.S. policymakers can not assume that the United States maintains global leadership in advanced sectors . American competitiveness is faltering and requires a coordinated strategy , led by the federal government , to reverse this trend . The approach taken by the U.S. government against Huawei , with export controls to sanction the company and cripple it , was hubristic—and ultimately backfired . An import ban on Huawei ’ s 5G network in the United States , along with urging allies and trade partners to follow suit , would have addressed the cybersecurity concerns about the company . Yet , the measures went beyond . The U.S. government took actions against the company for its alleged business with adversaries , such as Iran , which turned out to be costly for U.S. firms and damaging to American competitiveness . It later tried to cripple the company , underestimating Huawei ’ s innovation capabilities and the PRC ’ s support . Moreover , as this report shows , a 2012 Congressional report denouncing the company ’ s predatory practices and cybersecurity risks served as an early warning that prompted the company to invest in decoupling from U.S. technologies . Huawei ’ s resiliency threatens American competitiveness and market share . After the implementation of export controls , the company has successfully launched its in-house OS , HarmonyOS , which is now being rolled out on mobile devices , tablets , and laptops—potentially threatening U.S. firms ’ market share in these sectors . The company is also catching up in chipmaking and exploring new business lines , such as energy storage technologies and smart automotive solutions . Additionally , this report demonstrates how export restrictions harm U.S. companies , resulting in over $ 33 billion in lost sales and , in some cases , a relative reduction in R & D investments . The failure of U.S. policies against Huawei evidences an outdated rationale to address Chinese mercantilism . The current U.S.-China techno-economic competition differs significantly from earlier episodes when U.S. technological leadership was challenged . For example , the United States regained its semiconductor lead during the U.S.-Japan rivalry of the 1980s and today commands nearly five times Japan ’ s global market share . It succeeded by combining restrictions , diplomacy with an allied partner ( Japan ) , and sustained innovation . None of those conditions applies today : Chinese support offsets restrictions , the rivalry is with an adversary rather than an ally , and China has caught up or even pulled ahead in many strategic technologies . In other words , the United States is using yesterday ’ s tools against a fundamentally different adversary ; it needs a realistic , not hubristic , policy approach . Acknowledgments Huawei ’ s building “ spare tires ” in anticipation of U.S. sanctions is based on the company ’ s own statements , notably by Ren Zhengfei in 2019 . However , the broader narrative of Huawei ’ s preparations for U.S. restrictions and the “ spare tire ” concept was first fully documented and gained broad attention through detailed reporting in Eva Dou ’ s book House of Huawei : The Secret History of China ’ s Most Powerful Company . “ Backfire , ” the title of this report , is also the title of one of Annabel Yao ’ s singles .

US,itif.org,news,2023/12/13,Marshaling National Power Industries to Preserve America’s Strength and Thwart China’s Bid for Global Dominance,"China is on the march to dominate advanced industries that underpin national power in the 21st century. To protect U.S. economic strength and national security, policymakers must jettison old techno-economic and trade policy doctrines and adopt a new national power industry strategy. Contents Key Takeaways 1 Forward . 3 Executive Summary 5 Introduction . 13 Today’s Historical Turning Point 17 Explaining China . 27 The Nature and Importance of National Power Industries 48 America’s Power Industry China Strategy Choices 64 Consumer Welfare and Progressive Economics Vs. National Power Economics 91 An Operational Strategy For “Stand and Fight” 98 A National Power Industry Strategy Framework . 115 The Political Economy of National Power Industry Strategy 117 Appendix 1: Selected Chinese Advanced Industry Policies 130 Appendix 2: Key Takeaways for Major U.S. Policy Areas 133 Appendix 3: National Power Industry Typology and Categorizations 136 Endnotes 146 The United States risks losing its technological leadership to China at the expense of its economic and national security. [1] That is why the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) established the Hamilton Center on Industrial Strategy. [2] It is dedicated to advancing a comprehensive framework and specific policy agenda to maintain America’s competitive edge. [3] With America now facing an aggressive and often malign challenge from China, there is an urgent need for stronger policy advocacy and thought leadership that articulates the case for robust national strategic-industry policy. [4] This policy must focus on critical, dual-use technologies and industries in advanced, traded sectors of the economy. Such an approach requires firmly rebutting the deeply held view of most economists and many policymakers that all industries are created equal. In other words, no more “potato chips, computer chips—what’s the difference?” Strategic-industry policy demands making tough political choices and “picking winners”—not individual firms or specific technologies, but rather certain industries and categories of technology that are critical to the nation’s future. Finally, it requires a government that is knowledgeable and sophisticated about industry operations and the effects of policy on traded sectors. [5] Under the Hamilton Center, ITIF has launched a major research project focusing on China’s industrial goals and strategies, their impact on U.S. industrial power, how U.S. policymakers and experts should think about this challenge, and what a detailed and comprehensive policy agenda should look like. The project’s core thesis is that a specific set of industries acts as a vital wellspring of national power, either because they directly support the defense industrial base or because they limit dependence on U.S. adversaries that could be used for coercion. ITIF calls them “national power industries.” Without major structural change in U.S. policy—akin to the strategy America implemented at the beginning of the Cold War—we believe that the United States’ national power industries will weaken significantly, if not die, in turn weakening the U.S. defense industrial base and giving China techno-economic leverage over America in a broad range of areas, not just rare earth minerals. At its core, this challenge requires formulating and implementing a national power industry strategy grounded not just in economics but also in corporate strategy literature. This project focuses on several objectives. First, this report provides an overarching analytical framework and an enumeration of the stakes, including an assessment of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP’s) intent. It then proposes the concept of national power industries, classifying U.S. industries into four categories of relative importance to the power industry competition. The report examines why current techno-economic and trade policy doctrines that dominate Washington, DC, are flawed and misguided, then summarizes 18 different strategic directions offered by conventional foreign policy thinking and explains why these approaches are inadequate. Following this analysis, the report draws on corporate strategy literature to outline what a coherent and effective grand strategy for the national power industry competition should look like. Finally, it examines the political economy of implementing such a strategy. After this report, the project will conduct a series of quantitative and qualitative analyses examining the past and present performance of U.S. power industries, including comparisons to China. This analysis will examine impacts on the overall U.S. economy, the 50 states, and the competition between China and the United States for global market share in national power industries. Finally, the project will outline a comprehensive agenda for U.S. industrial policy that can be implemented by Congress and the administration. This will include both specific policies and recommendations for reorganizing government. The United States faces an existential challenge in China’s systematic campaign to dominate the advanced industries that enable national power in the 21st century. Unlike any competitor in American history, China combines the continental scale of a 1.4-billion-person economy with a Marxist-Leninist political system explicitly committed to achieving techno-economic supremacy over the Western democratic world. This is not normal economic competition between market economies—it is a carefully orchestrated, multi-decade strategic campaign to displace U.S. industrial capabilities, weaken allied nations, and fundamentally reshape the global order under CCP leadership. The stakes transcend economics. National power today depends on strength in what this report terms “national power industries”—a spectrum of sectors spanning pure defense production, dual-use technologies employed in both military and commercial applications, and enabling industries that support the broader industrial commons. These include semiconductors, aerospace, biopharmaceuticals, telecommunications equipment, advanced chemicals, precision machinery, robotics, artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and dozens of other sectors in which weakened or fatally injured firms would grant China dangerous leverage over the United States and its allies, as well as weaken U.S. defense production capabilities. On its current trajectory, it is likely that China will soon amass significantly greater capabilities than the United States will in national power industries. This competition occurs against a backdrop of American policy failure. For over two decades, U.S. leaders across both parties have operated under the assumption that China was becoming a “normal” market economy that would gradually liberalize politically and economically. That assumption has proven catastrophically wrong. China today is more authoritarian, more aggressive internationally, and more committed to state-directed capitalism than at any point since Mao’s death. On its current trajectory, it is likely that China will soon amass significantly greater capabilities than the United States will in national power industries. With those greater capabilities will come geostrategic hegemony over the West, unless the United States forestalls that outcome by adopting a new, transformative national power industry strategy that goes beyond a mere competitiveness or national innovation strategy. This is not a war that the United States and allies can win in the sense of significantly weakening or retarding the growth of China’s own national power industries. The only way Chinese attacks will end is if China becomes a free, democratic country. But the United States and allies can avoid defeat—keeping their national power industries relatively strong—by working together and adopting national power industry strategies. Perhaps the most damning evidence of Chinese intentions comes from internal Communist Party documents and speeches intended for party members rather than foreign audiences. As China scholar Daniel Tobin has documented, these reveal a regime explicitly committed to Marxist-Leninist global ambitions that go far beyond merely moving up the value chain and growing its economy. Xi Jinping has repeatedly framed China’s rise in ideological terms, stating that “scientific socialism is full of vitality in 21st century China” and that China offers “a new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence.” In a 2013 speech to senior party officials, Xi declared that “the viewpoint of historical materialism that capitalism is doomed to failure and socialism will prevail” remains valid, and that China must “seize the initiative, win the competitive edge, and secure our future” in a “long-term cooperation and rivalry between the two social systems.” Documents from the party’s 20th Congress state that China’s success has “significantly shifted the worldwide historical evolution of the contest between the two different ideologies and social systems of socialism and capitalism in a way that favors socialism.” Chinese leaders explicitly describe their work as part of a “great struggle” and “systems contest with Western capitalist democracy,” using terminology that leaves no ambiguity about their intentions. On technology and industry specifically, party documents are equally explicit. The minister of Science and Technology wrote in the People’s Daily that “the scientific and technological revolution and the contest between major powers are intertwined; the high-tech field has become the forefront and main battlefield of international competition.” Another official commentary stated: “To a certain extent, those who gain access to the Internet will gain the world. Core technology is an important weapon for the country.” China’s Made in China 2025 plan, while officially downplayed after international backlash, clearly articulates the goal: “Building an internationally competitive manufacturing industry is the only way China can enhance its comprehensive national strength, ensure national security, and build itself into a world power.” The plan calls for China to “seize the commanding heights of a new round of competition in the manufacturing industry” and achieve innovation leadership “ranking first globally.” The CCP follows a predictable playbook across industry after industry. Leading Chinese scholar Lu Yongxiang stated in 2024 that “by 2035, ‘Made in China’ will surpass the United States and become the global leader,” noting this would thrust the world into a “new era”—explicitly referencing an era of Chinese dominance. These are not the words of a nation seeking merely to “catch up” or achieve “legitimate development.” They are the explicit articulation of a campaign for global advanced industrial hegemony. China’s actions match its rhetoric. The CCP follows a predictable playbook across industry after industry. First, attract foreign investment by promising market access. Second, coerce technology transfer through joint venture requirements and other mechanisms—pressure the U.S. Trade Representative has characterized as “particularly intense.” Third, support domestic firms in copying and incorporating foreign technology while building indigenous capabilities through programs such as the 2006 Medium- and Long-term Program for Science and Technology Development, which identified 402 core technologies to master. Fourth, carve out and protect the Chinese market for Chinese firms, excluding foreign competitors once domestic champions can reasonably serve the entire Chinese market. Fifth, provide massive subsidies—estimated at minimum 1.73 percent of Chinese gross domestic product (GDP) annually, or over $400 billion per year, though actual figures are likely far higher accounting for provincial and local support. Finally, support Chinese firms “going out” to capture global market share, particularly in developing nations through Belt and Road Initiative investments exceeding $1 trillion. These dwarf the minimal industrial subsidies the U.S. government (USG) provides. The scale of Chinese subsidies dwarfs anything in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) nations. A German institute found that in 2022, 99 percent of listed Chinese firms received direct government subsidies, with electric vehicle (EV) maker BYD alone receiving over $3.7 billion. Chinese industrial subsidies were 4.5 times greater than U.S. subsidies as a share of GDP. Combined with a chronically undervalued currency, suppressed domestic consumption, and closed markets, these subsidies have enabled Chinese firms to sell below cost for years or decades, systematically destroying foreign competitors’ market positions. This is not to say that all Chinese efforts or innovation are win-lose. If China invents a cure for Alzheimer’s, the world benefits (assuming the United States or its allies would not also do so). But this would also reduce U.S. (and allied) strength in the pharmaceutical industry. Overall, the policy debate about China is largely dominated by international relations scholars and experts, not business or industrial strategy experts. The former are aware of the global competition for leadership in advanced industries, but they largely see it as subservient to overall foreign policy considerations and goals. Moreover, few understand the operation of advanced industries, the nature of the competition, or the importance of barriers to entry and reentry. As such, the prevailing narratives largely ignore techno-economic and trade war implications and the implications for U.S. power. Current U.S. thinking about China coalesces around three main strategic approaches, all of which are inadequate to the challenge. The first camp, still influential in much of the U.S. foreign policy establishment, prioritizes maintaining cooperative relations with China, even in the face of CCP behavior that harms U.S. national power industry capabilities. These experts argue that China’s growth benefits global prosperity, that Chinese cooperation is essential for addressing climate change and other global challenges, and that confrontation risks becoming a catastrophic conflict. A 2019 open letter signed by over 100 prominent scholars claimed that “we do not believe Beijing is an economic enemy or an existential national security threat” and argued that “the fear that Beijing will replace the United States as the global leader is exaggerated.” This camp consistently minimizes Chinese malfeasance while emphasizing supposed benefits of engagement. They cite Chinese economic growth as driving global prosperity (ignoring that China’s persistent trade surpluses actually reduce GDP elsewhere). In arguing that cooperation is needed on issues such as climate change, pandemic response, and AI governance, they gloss over the question of why the United States should be the supplicant when China has equal or greater interest in addressing these challenges. Their fundamental error is treating China as a partner rather than a strategic competitor. Engagers assume that continued dialogue and economic ties will moderate China’s behavior, when two decades of evidence proves otherwise. They prioritize the process of engagement over the substance of outcomes, accepting Chinese predatory practices as the price of maintaining access and conversation. A second camp acknowledges China’s rise but counsels patience, predicting that internal contradictions will lead to Chinese economic stagnation or political crisis. These analysts point to demographic decline, the housing bubble, government debt, and the inefficiencies of state capitalism as harbingers of inevitable Chinese failure. To be sure, many advance the well-trodden prescriptions such as improved K-12 education, more high-skill immigration, smarter regulation, and more government spending on science. But they will not go so far as to support a national power industry strategy. This “Peak China” thesis is seductive because it requires no painful U.S. policy changes. If China is destined to collapse under its own weight, the United States need only wait and maintain its existing approaches to the economy, trade, and national security. Proponents cite any negative Chinese economic news as evidence that their predictions are materializing, while ignoring continued Chinese gains in technological capabilities and global market share of advanced industries. The fatal flaw is mistaking China for the Soviet Union. Unlike Soviet command economics, Chinese state capitalism has proven remarkably effective at generating growth and technological advancement. The CCP studied why the Soviet Union failed and adopted fundamentally different economic management—allowing market forces to operate within state-directed strategic frameworks rather than attempting to centrally plan everything. Moreover, even if China faces economic headwinds from demographics or debt, these business-cycle challenges do not negate its structural advantages in the techno-economic competition. Chinese firms will continue benefiting from massive subsidies, protected markets, and patient capital regardless of GDP growth rates. Waiting for China to self-destruct while Chinese companies dismantle Western industries one after another is a prescription for defeat. The third camp acknowledges the challenge China presents but argues that American innovation superiority will enable the United States to prevail. These “dynamists” focus on deregulation, immigration reform, scientific research funding, and nurturing entrepreneurship—particularly in cutting-edge fields such as AI, quantum computing, and synthetic biology. This view holds that the United States need not defend legacy industries because American innovators will create entirely new sectors and the United States will lead them. Why fight over solar panels or EVs when we can dominate AI and quantum? The prescription is to boost science funding, reduce regulatory barriers, import more STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) talent, and trust that Silicon Valley-style innovation will deliver victory. The problems with this strategy are multiple. First, with a few exceptions (e.g., AI), it is industry-agnostic—there is no guarantee that market-driven innovation will produce capabilities in sectors that matter most for national power. Second, the United States has repeatedly lost production of technologies it invented, from televisions to solar panels to batteries, as other nations have commercialized American discoveries. Innovation alone does not ensure domestic production or competitive strength. Third, advanced defense systems increasingly rely on commercial technologies (spin-on rather than spin-off), making a strategy that abandons commercial sectors to China while hoping to maintain defense-only production unrealistic and prohibitively expensive. Fourth, the “industrial commons”—the ecosystem of suppliers, skilled workers, and manufacturing capabilities—erodes when industries disappear, making future innovation harder. Intel founder Andy Grove’s warning resonates: “Abandoning today’s ‘commodity’ manufacturing can lock you out of tomorrow’s emerging industry.” Finally, China is not ceding emerging technologies. Chinese firms are competitive or leading in AI (see Alibaba, Baidu, and DeepSeek), quantum communications, commercial space, robotics, and biotechnology. The notion that the United States can retreat to “higher ground” in emerging tech while China dominates established industries ignores that Chinese firms are aggressively pursuing both. The deeper problem is that dominant U.S. economic doctrines are fundamentally mismatched to the era of national power industry competition. The reigning paradigm in U.S. economic policymaking—which critics call “neoliberalism”—treats all industries as equivalent. Financial services and semiconductor fabrication are no different; both simply respond to market signals. The goal is to maximize consumer welfare through efficient resource allocation, which markets achieve better than governments do. The reigning paradigm in U.S. economic policymaking—which critics call “neoliberalism”—treats all industries as equivalent. In this framework, Chinese subsidies (including low labor costs and lax environmental regulations) are gifts to American consumers (lower prices!), not strategic attacks. Trade deficits reflect American prosperity (we’re rich enough to buy foreign goods!), not industrial weakness. Offshoring production to China demonstrates smart capital allocation by U.S. firms seeking higher returns, not a national security vulnerability. Consumer welfare economics has no concept of strategic industries or national power. Its proponents argue that “countries don’t compete, only companies do” and that concerns about industrial structure reflect economically illiterate protectionism. The Peterson Institute epitomizes this view, arguing that U.S.-China trade is “clearly win-win” and that “Chinese companies have a right to compete with U.S. companies and succeed in any sector, including in high-tech.” This doctrine might have been adequate when America faced no serious techno-economic competitor; it is catastrophically inadequate against China’s state capitalist predation. Markets have no inherent reason to preserve semiconductor fabrication, aerospace, or pharmaceutical production domestically. They are equally happy producing legal services, retail, and hospitality, none of which enable national power. But the reality of this techno-economic and trade attack fundamentally undercuts the foundation of consumer welfare economics and exposes its inability to address the current challenge. If national power is the ultimate goal, not consumer welfare, then this doctrine fails, at least in guiding the share of the economy composed of national economic power industries. If a nation’s industrial mix is critical, then a doctrine that gives equal weight to potato chips and computer chips fails. The ascendant alternative on the Left is equally unsuited to the challenge. Neo–New Dealism focuses on redistribution, social justice, and worker welfare overgrowth and competitiveness. Its industrial policy priorities are human services (childcare, eldercare), climate-focused sectors (renewable energy), and breaking up large corporations through aggressive antitrust. While rhetorically supporting “industrial policy,” progressives’ actual agenda—drug price controls, restricting intellectual property (IP), mandating labor standards that limit automation, attacking profitable corporations as exploitative—systematically weakens the large advanced-technology firms that must serve as national champions against Chinese competitors. Moreover, neo–New Dealism’s massive social spending agenda would consume the fiscal resources needed for strategic industrial investment. Its anticorporate ideology and deep suspicion of business-government collaboration make the public-private partnerships required for an effective national power industry strategy politically toxic. The reality of the CCP’s techno-economic and trade war on the West undercuts the foundations of neo–New Deal progressivism. If the United States is in an existential contest for global power, then boosting taxes and regulations on business is especially ill-advised, as are the neo-Brandeisian campaign to destroy large corporations and separate unrestrained demands from organized labor. Progressive advocates know this quite well, which is why they go to any end to deny that China is even a competitor. The United States needs a fundamentally new framework: a national power industry strategy. This approach recognizes the following: ▪ Industries differ fundamentally in strategic importance. Semiconductors and furniture are not equivalent. Some sectors—defense, dual-use, and enabling—are critical to national power and must be prioritized even at short-term economic cost. ▪ Markets are indifferent to national power. Unregulated market forces will not automatically preserve strategic capabilities. Government must actively shape industrial structure through strategy, not just generic competitiveness or innovation policies. ▪ China is a strategic competitor, not a normal trading partner. Chinese mercantilism requires defensive measures (restricting imports produced unfairly) and offensive support (strengthening domestic champions in national power industries) that violate free-market and progressive orthodoxies. ▪ Production matters as much as innovation. The United States cannot rely on inventing technologies that China then produces. Manufacturing capabilities, supply chain resilience, and industrial commons must be preserved domestically in strategic sectors. ▪ Long-term strategic positioning trumps short-term efficiency. Maintaining redundant capacity, subsidizing strategic industries, and accepting higher consumer prices are necessary costs of not losing the techno-economic war. This requires jettisoning the deeply held view that governments should not “pick winners.” Markets might optimize GDP growth, but only by happenstance will this generate needed national power industry capabilities. Policymakers must embrace strategic industry selection and support, drawing on business strategy frameworks rather than consumer welfare economics. The political economy obstacles to a national power industry strategy are severe. U.S. business leaders, shaped by decades of financial capitalism prioritizing quarterly returns and shareholder value, distrust government involvement and focus myopically on firm-level profitability rather than systemic strength. Unlike their predecessors from the 1940s–1970s who saw themselves as corporate statesmen with responsibilities to the broader capitalist system, today’s executives view government industrial policy as either incompetent interference or the thin edge of socialist control. Labor unions pursue short-term wage gains that often undermine firms’ long-term global competitiveness because they are unable to escape the prisoner’s dilemma of aggressive bargaining today leading to job losses to less-constrained Chinese rivals tomorrow. Conservative organizations reflexively oppose the government activism required for industrial strategy, while progressive organizations reflexively oppose supporting corporations. Neither party’s dominant coalition supports the combination of strong state capacity and empowered corporate champions that a national power industry strategy requires. Perhaps most critically, the USG itself lacks the analytical capacity, institutional structures, and personnel with expertise to formulate and execute sophisticated industrial strategy. Unlike China, where officials study industrial policy as a discipline and spend careers mastering sectoral dynamics, U.S. policymakers typically have backgrounds in law or generalist economics divorced from operational understanding of specific industries and technologies. The United States requires political, policy, and institutional transformation comparable to previous pivots after the War of 1812, the Civil War, and World War II. In all three cases, war provided the spur to overcome inertia and interest group resistance. We certainly hope it will not take a physical war to achieve similar transformation today. Either way, the organizing principle of economic policy must shift from maximizing consumer welfare or spurring social justice to ensuring that the United States maintains superior capabilities in national power industries relative to China. The simplest measures of this are the share of these industries’ global output that is produced in the United States and the share of U.S. production that occurs in allied nations. Related measures are the technological sophistication of U.S. products and services in national power industries compared with those of Chinese competitors. This demands classifying industries by strategic importance, developing sophisticated strategies for priority sectors informed by business strategy principles rather than economics, restricting unfairly traded Chinese goods’ access to allied markets, substantially increasing public and private investment in strategic sectors (on the order of $100 billion per year in tax incentives and direct expenditures for at least a decade), coordinating with allies to present unified responses, and building government institutional capacity for industrial strategy. The United States requires political, policy, and institutional transformation comparable to previous pivots after the War of 1812, the Civil War, and World War II. The costs will be significant: Implementing a national power industry strategy will bring higher prices for certain consumer goods, increased government spending, greater fiscal discipline elsewhere, and reduced returns for some investors as capital is channeled toward strategic rather than merely profitable uses. But the alternative is worse: a future in which Chinese dominance of advanced industries leaves the United States dependent on an adversary for critical technologies, unable to defend its interests or protect its allies, and relegated to second-tier status in a China-dominated world order. History shows that America can make fundamental pivots when circumstances demand. Whether it can do so absent the shock of military conflict—which might come too late, after critical capabilities are already lost—remains the defining question of our era. The window for effective action is narrowing. Chinese positions in industry after industry are becoming entrenched, protected by economies of scale, learning curves, network effects, and the enormous barriers to reentry that characterize advanced manufacturing. The reality is that once advanced industry capabilities are lost, they are extremely difficult to resurrect. The choice facing America is stark and unavoidable: Fundamentally reform techno-economic policy now by embracing the uncomfortable truth that some industries matter far more than others—and by recognizing that preserving them requires active government strategy—or accept a managed decline into second-tier status while China’s techno-economic dominance translates into geopolitical supremacy. There is no third option, no magical innovation breakthrough that will solve the problem without hard choices and real sacrifices. The United States remains far stronger than any declining power in history. Its advantages in innovation ecosystems, allied networks, capital markets, universities, and democratic legitimacy provide a foundation for successful competition if properly mobilized. But time is not on America’s side. Every industry lost makes recovery harder; every year of Chinese industrial expansion shifts the balance further; every failure to act because it violates free-market or progressive orthodoxies surrenders ground that cannot be regained. The techno-economic war with China is the central challenge of the 21st century. America’s response will determine not just its own future but the future of the liberal democratic world. National power is a country’s ability to both prevent other states from taking actions against its core interests and impose its will on other nations. Traditionally, national power was largely determined by military power. In the globally integrated economy of the 21st century, a key enabler of national power is strength in industries that not only support weapons system development and production, but also provide leverage over adversaries and limit their leverage over us. This leverage can be directly related to defense, as when China produces key materials and parts going into U.S. weapons systems (which it currently does) or indirectly such as when China is able to cripple key U.S. industries. [6] We call these key industries that are vital to the country’s strategic interests “national power industries.” With this context, let’s start with a series of key questions that, if answered in the affirmative, should form an immutable logic chain in support of a paradigmatically different kind of U.S. techno-economic and trade policy. First, does the United States need to be the strongest power nation on Earth, especially over China? If it doesn’t, then status quo economic and trade policies from the Left and Right will suffice. Second, if it does, then to what extent does national power come from relative strength in certain industries, particularly military, dual-use, and industries that enable the industrial commons that defense and dual-use industries rely on? If power is only loosely related to those types of industries, then the status quo policies will suffice. Third, if national power is significantly enabled by a certain class of industries, then to what extent is China seeking and capable of gaining relative strength over the United States and its allies in these industries? Related to that, is competition in these industries mostly win-lose, wherein China’s gains come at the expense of U.S. (and allied) losses? If the answer is either that China is not succeeding in these industries or that its success does not come at the expense of U.S. capabilities, then status quo policies will suffice. But if the answer to all these questions is yes—as ITIF argues for in this report—then the implications are profound. The logic chain points inexorably to the conclusion that unless the United States (and its allies) is stronger than China in particular industries and thus has more techno-economic leverage over China than China has over us, then U.S. power vis-à-vis China will be limited and there will be transformative consequences for the global balance of power and U.S. national interests. That logic chain has, or at least should have, profound implications for U.S. techno-economic and trade policy. It establishes that the conventional neoclassical, consumer-welfare–based economics that has dominated U.S. policymaking for more than 50 years needs to be scrapped for the simple reason that it is agnostic to national industry structure. As such, unless the country adopts a new strategy, not losing the power industry war with China will come down to happenstance and luck. This is because the dominant view in Washington, even among most Democrats, is that markets determine industry structure and all industries are of equal value. Financial services are no different than semiconductor production. It cannot be stressed enough that the acceptance of this core doctrine underpins virtually all U.S. techno-economic and trade policy. It explains the support for free markets and free trade and the aversion to “picking winners.” It explains why economic policy on the Right is about enabling market forces and on the Left about achieving better social policy outcomes by taxing and regulating the private sector. Both are indifferent to industry structure. In the past, this industry-agnostic, market-economics framework was not detrimental to national power because the United States did not face a competent techno-economic adversary in the form of the Soviet Union. In fact, the Soviet economy was incredibly fragile, and it made the U.S. economy seem like a goliath by comparison. [7] That unfortunately instilled a dangerous hubris into policy thinking that America suffers from to this day. Now that America faces a likely superior techno-economic adversary in the form of China led by the CCP, that doctrine and the policies that flow from it are no longer purpose-fit and need to be retired as quickly as possible. A world in which the United States (and allies) cannot lose power industry strength is a world that calls for a fundamentally new kind of techno-economic and trade policy. But the next question is whether the usual alternatives to free-market economics—competitiveness policy, innovation policy, technology policies, and/or manufacturing policy—are the right paths to follow. To be sure, these differ from free-market frameworks in that they privilege certain things over others: a better trade balance in advanced industries, more innovation, more output, and jobs in technology industries and manufacturing. However, while certainly a better fit for the world the United States and allied nations now find themselves in, these approaches are still inadequate because they advocate only for broad outcomes, and like free-market doctrine, they are indifferent to power industry strategy. Even if these policies are adequate and successful—to date, they have been inadequate—there is no guarantee that adopting them would produce requisite capabilities in the industries that the United States most needs to bolster in order to have superior power over China. If we get more toy and lumber manufacturing, but not more machine-tool and semiconductor manufacturing, the United States will lose out to China. In short, the United States (and its allies) need to be stronger than China in the industries that are wellsprings of national power in order to prevent China from asserting power and leverage over the United States and its allies. And a world in which the United States and its allies cannot lose strength in national power industries is a world that calls for a fundamentally new kind of techno-economic and trade policy. Circumstances have compelled the United States to make significant structural techno-economic and trade policy changes before: after the War of 1812, after the Civil War, and after WWII. It is once again time for America to make such fundamental changes in policy. The stakes then were less significant for the simple reason that there was much less global integration, and our adversaries were weaker. Today, the stakes and the conditions are fundamentally different. China is the first nation in over 125 years with the ability to challenge the United States from a techno-industrial perspective. In previous instances, it took wars to trigger this kind of fundamental structural change in policy and institutions. Hopefully, it will not take a kinetic war to bring needed change today. Because if it did, there is every reason to believe that the United States and allies will already have irrevocably lost many of their power industry capabilities and prohibitive barriers to entry will leave slim prospects for regaining them. Unfortunately, status quo thinking and vested interests hinder power-industry economics from emerging. First, most foreign policy experts, even while acknowledging the authoritarian rule of Xi Jinping, continue to believe that China is a normal, market-oriented, emerging economy and that “socialism with Chinese characteristics” is just a slogan used for domestic purposes to mask China’s true capitalist nature. Second, while there is growing awareness of the West’s techno-economic dependence on China, that dependence is generally seen as limited to a few narrow areas, such as rare earth minerals, which are said to be easily fixed with the right policies. Third, the conventional view of international economics is both that trade is welfare-maximizing for all parties and that while companies may compete, countries do not. In other words, there is no battle for global market share in key national power industries. Finally, even the most die-hard China hawks and manufacturing supporters do not view the world in terms of power-industry competition with China. For them, getting more U.S. manufacturing jobs is the goal, whether they support national power or not. In a world with these assumptions, status-quo responses suffice. The United States and its allies compete with China and others for market share in advanced industries, and we win some and lose some. And to the extent we lose, we just create new industries and firms because of our inherent innovation strengths. Besides, old industries are for losers. To the extent trade barriers arise, they are handled through normal bilateral or multilateral processes. And domestically, the United States can rely on existing economic policies and institutional structures to ensure reasonable levels of competitiveness and prosperity. U.S. techno-economic and trade policy needs to have as its inspiration and fundamental organizing principle not ensuring economic freedom and efficiency, not social justice, and not stopping climate change—but also not losing in a wide array of strategic industries. Too many U.S. experts, pundits, and policymakers see the CCP as perhaps a bit more focused on industrial policy and a bit less interested in obeying global trade rules than the West is, but not an assertive Marxist-Leninist actor that stands apart. As such, there is no need for a radical overhaul of U.S. techno-economic and trade policy. (Obviously the Trump administration and most China hawks are not in this camp.) As described herein, there are many reasons for the resistance to accept this new reality. But this new reality needs to be accepted and acted upon. This report proceeds from the fundamental view that the CCP seeks global hegemony, that it views techno-economic dominance in national power industries as a key pillar of that long-standing campaign, and that it will do virtually anything to win that quest. As such, the United States and its democratic allies who stand for freedom and human rights need to respond by fundamentally rethinking and restructuring their techno-economic and trade policies. This boils down to a simple but fundamentally far-reaching proposal: U.S. (and allied) techno-economic and trade policy needs to have as its inspiration and fundamental organizing principle, not ensuring economic freedom and efficiency, not prioritizing social justice, not stopping climate change, and not keep AI from taking over—but instead not losing in a wide array of strategic industries. I say “not losing,” as opposed to winning, because China is such a formidable competitor—with a massive domestic and friendly international market (e.g., Belt and Road nations) and an enormous “bank account” to subsidize its way to power industry market share—that it is likely not be possible to keep Chinese firms from being the leaders in many national power industries, especially in non-OECD markets. But what the West can and must do is to avoid losing its own power industry capabilities. [8] National power industries are not just any manufacturing or even technologically advanced industries. They can be thought of as three categories, from most important to least: military industries, dual-use industries, and enabling industries. Examples of military industries are guided missiles and tank production. Examples of dual use are electronic displays and semiconductors, which are used in both defense and commercial industries. Imagine as a thought exercise that China dominated optics and displays. This would give China the ability to cripple U.S. defense capabilities because optics and display technologies are critical for night-vision goggles, heads-up instrument displays for fighter pilots, rifle scopes, and myriad other military applications. Enabling industries include automobiles and heavy construction equipment, which help support the industrial commons needed for dual-use and defense industries. Industries such as furniture, cosmetics, sporting goods, wind turbines, wood products, cement, and toys are not national power industries, in part because losing them would not create any serious vulnerabilities to China. Kids might not have many toys, but we can live with that. The same is true for virtually all nontraded sectors, which are, by definition, not subject to competition from foreign imports (e.g., barber shops, personal service providers, etc.) It is time for the United States government to craft a coherent power industry strategy. Because maintaining allied strength in national power industries is critical, policymakers must jettison the deeply held view that governments should not pick winners and that market outcomes are Panglossian in nature—the best of all possible worlds. Markets might optimize per-capita GDP growth (although even here, there are market failures that suggest some government intervention is needed to maximize per-capita GDP growth), but only by luck and happenstance will this generate the power-industry capabilities the United States needs to maintain superiority over China. There is no inherent reason why the United States will produce telecom equipment, semiconductors, electronic displays, circuit boards, and more. And even with robust defense spending, weakness in dual-use and enabling industries would undermine the defense sector, requiring massively larger defense budgets to produce the weapons systems the Department of Defense (DOD) needs in specialized factories with limited economies of scale. Markets, for all their value, are happy to enable the production of financial advisors, legal services, and high-end garments, while allowing dual-use sectors to wither and die in the face of subsidized Chinese production. This is true even with a robust national manufacturing strategy, which might end up with more production of shoes, golf clubs, and two-by-fours, but not optics, machine tools, and lasers, which weapons systems need. Policymakers already understand this when it comes to the production of weapons such as fighter aircraft and guns. While private companies make these, they do so under government contracts. It’s time to extend that thinking to dual-use and enabling industries too—not that in all or even most cases would these industries be supported by government contracts. But in all cases, there should be well-crafted and effectively implemented government strategies to ensure continued dynamic capabilities in national power industries. The implications of this simple yet profoundly important change in thought are significant. In short, it is time for the United States government to craft a coherent power industry strategy. No, this does not mean state socialism or crony capitalism and Solyndra. No, it does not mean corporate welfare. But it does require embracing the concept of national power industry strategy, some of which, as described ahead, can be built on the insights from the scholarly and professional literature on corporate strategy. Despite what some free-market conservatives argue, America’s economic and trade policies have not been consistent since the founding of the Republic. Rather, key inflection points have occurred, leading to new beliefs, institutional arrangements, and policies. And each time, America’s leaders have made the right choice, although often through trial and error and incremental adjustments. But the transformations have been made that have enabled a more powerful and wealthier nation. It’s worth reviewing these historical pivots. From its colonial founding until the second war with the British (the War of 1812), American leaders largely saw the colonies and then the nation as a peripheral, natural resource economy, dependent on Britain for trade in manufactured goods that were to be paid for through exports of staples (wood, fish, tobacco, furs, etc.). After the revolution, some, such as Alexander Hamilton, recognized that this was fundamentally a relationship of dependency. That is why he “believed that in industry lay our great national destiny.” [9] He did not want America to remain a “hewer of wood and drawer of water.” Indeed, he argued that government should “cultivate particular branches of trade ... and to discourage others.” [10] That’s why America’s first successful manufacturing firm, the Society of Useful Manufacturers, was funded by the state of New Jersey and leading American financiers that Hamilton convinced to fund it. Even Jefferson embraced national developmentalism, including protective tariffs. [11] As president, his goal was to repay the national debt and then use the revenues to fund “rivers, canals, roads, arts, manufacturers, education and other great objects.” [12] He “encouraged new branches of industry that may be advantageous to the public, either by offering premiums for discoveries, or by purchasing from their proprietors such inventions as shall appear to be of immediate and general utility, and rendering them free to the citizens at large.” [13] But it wasn’t until the shock of the war of 1812 that a true consensus for industrial development emerged. Indeed, in 1816 Jefferson wrote, “You tell me I am quoted by those who wish to continue our dependence on England for manufactures. There was a time when I might have been so quoted with more candor, but within the 30 years, which have since elapsed, how are circumstances changed!” [14] Jefferson was a man who was willing to change his thinking when conditions required doing so. Indeed, the war broadened and heightened calls for more efforts to develop American industry. Henry Clay and other Whigs devised “the American System,” consisting of tariffs to protect and promote industry; a national bank to foster commerce; and federal subsidies for roads, canals, and other domestic improvements. The latter also involved subsidies to targeted industries, including at the state government level. When running in 1832 as a Whig, Abraham Lincoln stated, “[M]y politics are short and sweet, like the old woman’s dance. I am in favor of a national bank ... in favor of the internal improvements system, and a high protective tariff.” [15] These changes enabled the development of American industries, many driven by waterpower, including textiles, muskets and rifles, shipbuilding, and others. The next pivot was the Civil War. This time the core change domestically was whether the United States would fully embrace industrialization to become a world power, with the centralization of power and high tariff walls that entailed. Or would it allow industrialization to occur at its own pace with much of the U.S. economy maintained as an agrarian and plantation export economy. Southern plantation states opposed this mission and the institutional changes that it entailed, in part because it meant higher prices for what farmers consumed and reduced overseas markets for what they sold. The Civil War made the choice inexorable, and with the victory of the Northern States, the United States proceeded to industrialize at a rapid rate behind a high tariff wall and with the support of defense industry purchases. Indeed, for the rest of that century, the United States was the China of its day: an economy in which industrialization was everything and growth was off the charts. This led European countries to despair. As David Kedrosky wrote: Frederick Arthur McKenzie’s The American Invaders and WT Stead’s The Americanization of the World (both 1901) were just two of an avalanche of publications advertising the rot of Britain and the inevitability of its supersession by its youthful, vigorous former colony. Economists cast about for something, or someone, to blame. [16] He went on to cite leading British economists Alfred Marshall, who sounded the alarm in 1903 (wish that we had more Alfred Marshalls today in the United States): Sixty years ago England had leadership in most branches of industry. It was inevitable that she should cede much to the great land which attracts alert minds of all nations to sharpen their inventive and resourceful faculties by impact on one another. It was inevitable that she should yield a little of it to that land of great industrial traditions which yoked science in the service of man with unrivalled energy. It was not inevitable that she should lose so much of it as she has done. [17] The next major pivot came with the American victory in WWII and then the rise of an aggressive and expansive Marxist-Leninist Soviet Union. After WWII, the forces for returning to the pre-war status quo were strong. In 1946, Truman’s State of the Union speech called for bringing most troops home and demobilizing. [18] And his economic policy was to continue New Deal social programs but embrace Keynesian cycle management. But it was only after Soviet expansionism into Eastern Europe, the development in 1947 of the “Truman Doctrine,” a few years later Stalin giving the green light for Kim Il Sung to invade South Korea, and seven years later the Soviets launching Sputnik that America responded with overwhelming force. The United States chose to assume leadership of the free world, in part because of the fall of the British Empire and the benefits that came with hegemony, but also become someone needed to stop Soviet expansionism. Indeed, NSC-162-2, a new national security policy generated through the Solarium project initiated by President Eisenhower, argued for a new approach to national policy to address the Soviet threat. [19] Among other things, it called for, “in the face of the Soviet threat, the security of the United States requires … A mobilization base, and its protection against crippling damage, adequate to insure victory in the event of general war.” This new strategic approach meant several things: first, the rejection of tariffs and the embrace of free trade and global integration, in part to ensure more stable democracies around the world aligned with the United States, because at home, the Cold War meant unprecedented massive funding for science and technology. Second, starting in WWII, the federal government dramatically ramped up its support for advanced industry. By the early 1960s, it spent more on research and development (R&D) than the rest of the world combined. [20] That fueled an enormous array of breakthroughs, including computers, semiconductors, jet aviation, lasers, numerically controlled machine tools, satellites, relational databases, and of course, the Internet. Indeed, NSC-162-2 called the United States to “[c]onduct and foster scientific research and development so as to insure superiority in quantity and quality of weapons systems, with attendant continuing review of the level and composition of forces and the industrial base required for adequate defense and successful prosecution of general war.” [21] Starting in WWII, the federal government dramatically ramped up its support for advanced industry. By the early 1960s, it spent more on R&D than the rest of the world combined. Turning points are hard. There is a reason societies establish routines, fixed institutions, and common rules. Changing them is hard. Vested interests oppose them. Few experts have the intellectual fortitude to challenge their own frameworks. Voters get comfortable with the status quo. And democratic politics makes change hard. But as history shows, when the disjuncture between external reality and internal frameworks and approaches becomes wide enough, America has been able to successfully embrace pivot points. Perhaps the most important question facing the nation today is, does the U.S. political economy have the capability, absent a military conflict with China, to make the needed changes? The final part of this report examines this question. After the Soviet threat evaporated in the early 1990s, American leadership assumed that the United States was not only in a unipolar moment, but that, as Francis Fukayama argued, history itself had ended. [22] In other words, Western liberal democratic capitalism had triumphed over all. If he had in fact been correct, there would be no need to write this report, as China would be well on the way to a free-market democracy. But also, he and most others were so enthused by the collapse of the Soviet Union that enthusiasm overrode reality. As a result, the ideological and policy ideas that went with this phase have not only remained as core to U.S. techno-economic and trade governance, but at least until recently, become even more embedded in American thinking. Since America won, there was and is no real historical turning point other than one that reinforced the primacy of the U.S. system. Four core ideas remain. First, it is America’s role to advance free trade and globalization even if it was not in our narrow interest. Free trade, especially other nations selling to America, helped ensure that they entered the American orbit and not the Soviet one or remained unaligned. The U.S. economy was so strong that it could afford uneven trading arrangements. Indeed, until the early 1970s, the U.S. economy enjoyed trade surpluses. Later, as those surpluses turned to trade deficits and the United States became the importer of last resort, the view was that the U.S. economy was still the strongest, and besides, trade deficits not only didn’t matter, but they were also a reflection of economic strength. Ahh, the power of wishful thinking. On top of that was the pervasive idea held by the foreign policy establishment and economists that not only was all trade good, but so too was the movement of U.S. business operations overseas. Indeed, a 2013 survey of Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) members found that 73 percent believed that the U.S. economy would be strengthened if more U.S. companies set up operations overseas. In contrast, just 23 percent of the U.S. public believed this. [23] One is reminded of William Buckely’s quip that he would rather live in a society governed by the first 2,000 names in the Boston phone book than one governed by 2,000 Harvard faculty members. [24] Also, 52 percent of CFR members predicted that China would become more democratic by 2023 and 34 percent thought China would be a key future ally by then. President Xi, did you see this survey? If so, why did you not go along with the CFR folks? As surpluses turned to trade deficits and the United States became the importer of last resort, the view was that the U.S. economy was still the strongest, and besides, trade deficits not only didn’t matter, but they were also a reflection of economic strength. Following in the intellectual path set by classical economist David Ricardo, the consensus view became that trade was always win-win, and there was a comparative advantage wherever a nation’s industrial structure was based on—unless distorted by suboptimal government policies—inherent natural comparative advantages. Not only was there no reason for government to alter “natural” industrial structure, but it was also welfare reducing to do so. Moreover, to the extent there were foreign deviations from free trade, they were seen as barriers and distortions that hurt the countries putting them in place, not as attacks on U.S. companies and the U.S. economy. In this regard, free trade is seen as a natural phenomenon producing natural and superior results. The fact that most of the rest of the world neither believed nor practiced this only reinforced the messianic mission of America to teach the heathens the errors of their ways and convert them to the free trade religion. Second, what ultimately buttressed this the way free booze buttresses an alcoholic was the fact that the U.S. dollar was the reserve currency. The dollar was accepted everywhere, and ultimately, if the United States needed more dollars, unlike any other nation, it could simply print more. This is termed the “exorbitant privilege” that let the United States run massive trade deficits for decades. In realty, it was not a privilege but an albatross around America’s neck, allowing policymakers to be indifferent to structural trade deficits. With such massive trade deficits, any other nation would have had to devalue its currency and grow its exports and reduce imports. But not the United States. And so, U.S. manufacturing, including national power industries, shrank. And because there was no real consequence to this—foreign nations continued to pour money into the United States, in part to keep their currency values low and exports high—it was easy for American pundits and experts to ignore and deny the decay of American power industry capabilities. Indeed, most to this day still defend the reserve currency status of the dollar as a key source of national power, instead of what it really is: a cancer on national power industry competitiveness. Third, because the techno-economic power imbalance between the United States and the Soviets was so large, there was no need for a strategic industry policy. The Soviets might have had a peer-competitor military, but they by no means had a peer-competitor set of national power industries. And one reason was that Soviet command economics, unlike Chinese state capitalism, was incredibly limiting. Soviet Gosplan was in fact a central planner and allocator of goods and services. Fourth, science and technology proceeded from funding to scientists to pursue basic research in whatever areas they chose (what FDR science advisor Vannevar Bush laid out as the linear model of basic science to commercial production) and company-funded research based on market forces alone. This meant that just as “computer chips, potato chips what’s the difference?” prevailed in economic thinking, “astrophysics, quantum physics what’s the difference?” prevailed in science funding. In other words, the United States was so far ahead of other nations in science that it had the luxury of funding a large share of the world’s basic, exploratory research that other nations used to build their advanced industry export economies. As such, neoclassical, non-goal-oriented economic policy became accepted as all-time truth. It was true everywhere and always. Short-run efficiency generated from market actors operating in response to market-determined price signals was the lode star. Externalities, with perhaps the exception of pollution, were few and far between, and government’s efforts to intervene in this natural, indeed beautiful, process were, by definition, welfare-reducing. This truth still dominates U.S. expert, pundit, and policymaker thinking. An emblematic example is a Washington Post op-ed excoriating President Trump’s conditioning CHIPS Act grant funding to Intel on the federal government getting an ownership share. Yes, this was a bad decision, but not because it violated free-market dogma, but because it ultimately weakened Intel, clearly a power industry company. [25] The Post’s statement is a perfect reflection of what current U.S. consensus is regarding techno-economic and trade policy where power industry concerns are nonexistent: This deal is the culmination of America’s resurgent interest in industrial policy, the same interest we always develop when we sense a challenge to our global economic dominance. Whenever we spot a new competitor on the horizon, we look wistfully at China — or Germany, or Japan — and wonder if it’s a mistake to let the market decide what America produces. Maybe we should learn a lesson from the competition and let the government, with its deep pockets and longer time-horizons, take a bigger role in shaping the economy. This particular policy also risks distorting the free-market system that has delivered better results for America, and the world, than any state-managed competitor has ever achieved. And it is unlikely to fix the deep problems with Intel, which have been decades in the making. There is an argument for industrial policy in strategically vital products. The United States does not want to source critical defense inputs from geostrategic rivals. But that argument only works if you make three dubious assumptions: that the government can confine its efforts to strategically important industries (rather than, say, bailing out failing automakers with politically powerful unions); that it can spend the money wisely (rather than wasting huge sums on efforts that sounded better to planners than to buyers); and that the companies that find themselves showered with money will use it to turn themselves into globally competitive superstars, rather than to maintain a lackluster operation thanks to the subsidies. [26] A few years ago, this op-ed would have been exactly the same, but without the reference to the need for “strategically vital products.” At least now elite discourse has to include a passing reference to this, before it then breezes on praising the wonders of the free market. There is one final component of the America’s techno-economic and trade doctrine, one that did not emerge until the fall of the Soviet Union: American hubris. In its close, the op-ed at least considers that it might be necessary for the United States to have strong national power industries, but the authors still couldn’t help themselves and fall back into conventional thinking, claiming that the old model actually works when it comes to national power industries. Government, it claims: can also work harder on improving infrastructure and fixing government policies that drive up manufacturing costs, such as land-use regulations and taxes. But the United States should not try to beat China by becoming China. We should compete the way we always have: by relying on the free enterprise system that has served us so well for so long. [27] If this is not a rejection of the need for a doctrinal shift in response to an historical turning point, I don’t know what is. There is one final component of the America’s techno-economic and trade doctrine, one that did not emerge until the fall of the Soviet Union: American hubris. At least during the Cold War, leaders on both sides of the aisle were worried about the Soviet challenge, not just militarily but also technologically, especially in the 1950s and 1960s as Soviet space and nuclear technology advanced. In hindsight, the technology threat was overstated, but nonetheless, policymakers remained apprehensive, ever focused on maintaining our lead. Now, absent that threat, America suffers from what Chinese political economist Heng-Fu Zou calls “status-quo-based optimism.” [28] In other words, too many U.S. experts and policymakers still see the world as it was from 1990 to the mid-2000s when the belief was that United States was preeminent in virtually everything. Communism had been defeated and was consigned to the dustbin of history. China was a poor, developing market economy, not a development-oriented Marxist-Leninist dictatorship. And emerging signs that China might be becoming a peer competitor were almost completely ignored by the expert class, so much so that individuals and organizations that tried to issue warnings were dismissed as cranks. Case in point: the U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission, an entity created by Congress as a sop to those worried about the effects of letting China in the World Trade Organization (WTO) . For years, the view in Washington was that these were a bunch of crazed China hawks and it was largely frowned upon for experts to testify in front of this commission. Because the United States had vanquished its foes and stood tall and unopposed (except by jihadists that turned airplanes into missiles), that meant, by definition, that the current techno-economic and trade system was optimal. It had led to the prosperous and strong America. No one could touch us. So why challenge what had worked so well? This is perhaps the driving factor in why so many in the expert and political classes are so closed to considering new techno-economic and trade frameworks. The old/current system worked great. Why fix it if it ain’t broke? Accepting realities would mean a weakening of the foundations of the tripartite American techno-economic and trade doctrine: free trade, free markets, and reserve currency. That doctrine, and the professional reputations built upon it, must, at all costs, be defended. And it is also why so many in the expert and political classes are almost completely impervious to data suggesting that reality no longer exists, especially the increasingly obvious Chinese techno-economic rise and the concomitant American decline, as well as Xi’s Marxist-Leninist global hegemonic aspirations. Reams of data showing China’s techno-economic rise are ignored or denied, as is data showing U.S. decline. Well, the data must be wrong. Or China is different. Or the data doesn’t apply to the United States. Besides, we all know that China has a host of short-term business cycle challenges (e.g., housing glut), so no need to consider structural change. A bit more science spending, some regulatory tweaks, and some more high-skilled immigration and all will be ship-shape. Accepting these realities would mean a weakening of the foundations of the tripartite American techno-economic and trade doctrine: free trade, free markets, and reserve currency. That doctrine, and the professional reputations built upon it, must, at all costs, be defended. In other words, the consensus among the elite class is that the current system suffices. However, what is striking about past fundamental pivots in American techno-economic and trade systems is that all were in response to war: the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812; the Civil War; and WWII and the Korean War. Before each of these conflicts, the consensus view was for the then current system. Few policymakers and elites had any real desire to change, and those that did were in the minority with no real power. It was the shock and destruction of war that made the rejection of the old system and the embrace of a new system a virtual requirement. Today, without a great-power war to spur change, there is little that is doing so. The Chinese national power trade attacks are not major battles, but rather a constant drip-drip of allied and U.S. losses that are either overlooked or rationalized as inconsequential. Better to defend the tripartite system of free trade, free-market economics, and reserve dollar and attack or ignore anyone who has the temerity to challenge it. Better to attack Trump as a clueless protectionist rather than to acknowledge that his concerns, if not necessarily his policies, reflect a new reality. It is possible that a People’s Republic of China (PRC) invasion of Taiwan might produce such a motive force. But it might not because U.S. leaders and the public could just give up and either not intervene or intervene but quickly withdraw after casualty numbers go up and missile stocks go down. If the PRC were smart and understood America, it would bide its time (it can no longer hide its light) until its GDP and power industry and military capabilities significantly outweigh those of the United States and the West. If it invaded then, even if the shock of war and defeat were enough to highlight the defects of the current system and motivate the embrace of a new one, it would be too late to do anything meaningful. U.S. and allied techno-organizational capabilities for renewal, including an existing advanced industrial base, would be below what is needed. As discussed ahead, the barriers to entry in most of these complex and capital-intensive industries would be too high. Even if the American populace and the elite class came together with a massive Sputnik-like movement and responded, the amount of effort and money needed to rebuild would be enormous. And so t he techno-economic war would be over, and the United States would have lost most of its national power industry capabilities with virtually no way to get them back, akin to the United Kingdom after WWII. All the United Kingdom can do now is show nostalgic TV shows on BBC about when Britannia ruled the world. Box 1: Britain’s Failure to Grasp Its Turning Point Like America, Britain faced a turning point during and after WWII, but unlike the United States, it failed to successfully turn, resulting in the permanent (at least to today), long-term deindustrialization and decline of the United Kingdom. In his masterful book The Audit of War: The Illusion and Reality of Britain as a Great Nation, British historian Correlli Barnett documented the failures and why. [29] Like noted industrial historian Alfred Chandler, Barnett argued that British industry did not succeed in emulating American mass production and the management that went along with it. As Elbaum and Lazonick wrote: Successful capitalist development in twentieth century German, Japan and the United States demonstrates the ubiquitous importance of the visible hand of corporate bureaucratic management. To meet with international challenge, British industries required transformation of their strategies of industrial relations, industrial organization, and enterprise management. Vested interests in the old structures, however, proved formidable obstacles to the old transition from competitive to corporate modes of organization. [30] The result was significant lags in productivity and quality of manufactured goods, especially compared with Germany and the United States. And in many areas, Britain was completely dependent on other nations. For example, during the war, Britain was totally reliant on the United States for over 20 kinds of machine tools it had never been able to make itself. [31] Some of this was due to poor management; many firms were still family owned and modest in size. Much of it was due to strong labor unions and their utter opposition to the kinds of industrial organization and job change that would be required to boost efficiency to be able to compete internationally. It would have been one thing if Britain were losing its old industries but at least gained the new ones, such as chemicals, electronics, and aerospace. But it failed there as well, in part because of the persistence of the craft industry, as opposed to mass production—and also because the government spent so little on R&D. At the same time, the schools and university system, unlike that of Germany and the United States, focused on traditional education, especially learning the classics, and neglected both skilled-trades education and STEM education. It wasn’t that certain groups and individuals in government were not aware of these challenges. Some were and proposed fairly far-reaching industrial policy changes that, if implemented, would have certainly reduced the scope and scale of deindustrialization and lack of progress in emerging science-based industries. But at a political economy level, there were three forces that meant failure. The first was the long-standing British free-market ideology, especially among economists that eschewed any more than minimal government role in restructuring industry. And the Conservative Party’s top priority was on “sound finance” and free trade. And many economists opposed scrapping out-of-date industrial machinery until that had been completely depreciated and was no longer working. The second was the rise of the Labour Party and its massive embrace of what Barnett has called “The New Jerusalem”: the idea that the state would provide a new almost utopian life for British citizens through public spending. Based in part on the 1942 “Beverage Report,” which called for “cradle to grave” public support, including national health insurance, massive housing spending, and more money on education, the new Labour government under Atlee saw this as its overwhelming task to implement these wartime proposals. Indeed, the view of many was that Britain deserved this after its all-out fight to defeat Hitler. As Barnett wrote, “New Jerusalem was their [British ‘enlightened’ establishment Party officials] high-minded gift which they proceeded successfully to press on the British people between 1940 and 1945, with far-reaching effects on the British people’s postwar chances as an industrial power struggling for survival and prosperity.” [32] This massive new social services spending campaign crowded up virtually all needed public investment to be able to compete. It was not that the officials didn’t know that this would cost a lot of money. Rather, as Barnett wrote, they pursued this vision “on the best romantic principle that sense must bend to feeling, and facts to faith,” much like American conservatives and liberals push for tax cuts and spending increases, respectively, even when the till is empty. [33] And ironically, the factor that held both the Conservative and Labour views together was the still prevalent individualism over communitarianism. School reform was based on freedom for the individual, rather than on what would boost national power. Spending was based on satisfying immediate needs, rather than boosting national power in the medium term. As a result, national investment was minimal, just one-third of post-war Germany levels. In summary, Barnett stated, “If Britain after the war was to earn the immense resources required to maintain her cherished traditional place as a great power and at the same time to pay for New Jerusalem at home, she had to achieve nothing short of an economic miracle. Such a miracle could only be wrought through the transformation, material and human, of her essentially obsolete industrial society into one capable of triumphing in the world markets of the future.” [34] Had all the most powerful groups and institutions in that society enthusiastically been willing to throw themselves behind the process of transformation, it still would have been difficult enough to achieve, given the scale of inherited problems. But instead of such willingness, there existed massive inertial resistance to change, which was so manifest in the history of Briain as an industrial society; a resistance that not even the shock of war had proved strong enough to budge more than a little. [35] What does this all mean then? First and foremost, it means that the core challenge for America is wholesale abandonment of the post-war free-trade comparative advantage, free-market, and reserve currency doctrines and practices, and their replacement with doctrines and practices fitted for U.S.-China power industry conflict, as discussed ahead. But the reality is that the preservation of U.S. and allied techno-economic power needs to take center stage in American politics and government. As Chinese scholar Heng-Fu Zou wrote in an article modeling China-U.S. great power competition, “Power is not a neutral consequence of growth, but a strategic externality. As a result, national welfare depends negatively on rival strength, even absent direct miliary confrontation.” [36] He went on to argue, “This provides formal justification for industrial policies aimed at limiting rival capacity … These policies are rational from a strategic welfare standpoint, even if they reduce short-run efficiency.” [37] His last point is one that simply cannot be understood by most America economists who see reducing short-run efficiency as the height of economic stupidity. Compared with China, the Soviet Union was a pre-season warm-up game in the minor leagues. Sure, it had military strength, including a powerful nuclear arsenal. But it’s ability to degrade America’s techno-economic strength was minimal and its ability to generate its own strength was even less. At the same time, proactive domestic policies are needed. As Zho has stated, “Without proactive [U.S.] efforts to rebuild internal economic structure—both material (capital, factories, supply chains) and immaterial (skills, institutional memory, R&D ecosystems)—the relative power dynamic will continue to tilt toward China.” [38] Given today’s reality of China’s rise and America’s decline, this should be so obvious that it need not even be stated. But alas, it is not and so it needs to be asserted. Zou summed it up: Strategic rivalry in the 21st century is driven not only by military buildup or ideological narratives, but by underlying economic flows, learning dynamics and structural investments. Geopolitical outcomes are endogenous to trade, production and policy strategy. For the United States, reversing strategic decline will require more than tactical trade defense [e.g., tariffs]; it will require a coordinated industrial renaissance. [39] This reality should be extremely sobering. Compared with China, the Soviet Union was a pre-season warm-up game in the minor leagues. Sure, it had military strength, including a powerful nuclear arsenal. But it’s ability to degrade America’s techno-economic strength was minimal and its ability to generate its own strength was even less, even as it engaged in massive IP spying and buying capabilities from the Europeans, who like today, were always willing to make a euro, even if it meant enabling an adversary. Maybe Lenin was thinking of them when he said, “the capitalists will sell us the rope by which we will hang them.” [40] By the early 1980s, U.S. techno-economic dominance over the Soviet Union had become increasingly apparent to U.S. policymakers. [41] As such, that conflict was largely about military capability and convincing the rest of the world that the capitalist, democratic system was superior to the socialist, authoritarian one. That was as easy as arguing that Micheal Jordan was better than an NBA player coming off the bench. China is the finals of the major league. What is China? That is the key question to answer. Much of the need to adopt a new techno-economic and trade doctrine depends on a simple question of what China is and what it wants to accomplish. The conventional view among most U.S. foreign policy experts is that it is a normal capitalist nation (albeit an authoritarian one) that just wants to develop as other developing nations have; or as some will admit, it just wants to have strategic independence from the United States. The reality is that view is deeply naïve. The Chinese government is not a “normal” developing nation seeking growth, or even a fifth “Asian Tiger” seeking to rapidly move up the value chain through exports. China is a Marxist-Leninist dictatorship seeking global techno-economic domination by growing its own firms in virtually all emerging and foundational advanced technology industries. The intended casualty is the global market share and even the survival of Western and U.S. firms and industries. China’s arsenal includes an array of weapons, including massive subsidies, IP theft, standards manipulation, closed domestic markets, and the incorporation into the Chinese orbit of an array of developing economies. China is not a free trader or a protectionist, the only categories available for Western discourse. Rather, drawing on historical parallels, namely Albert Hirschman’s account of pre-war German economic policy, China’s subsidies, market closing, intellectual-property coercion, and overcapacity dumping are neither accidental nor benign. They revive the notion that trade can be weaponized, a concept powerfully elaborated by Farrell and Newman in “Weaponized Interdependence.” [42] China is a “power trader” rather than a mere beneficiary of globalization, and that means we need to realign the policy debate toward defense of critical industries that enable national power and away from simplistic free trade versus protectionism binaries. A key CCP weapon is flooding foreign markets with lower-priced products in order to capture market share from foreign leaders. Many trade experts refer to this process as Chinese overcapacity, as if this is simply an unexpected effect of the various forces at work in the Chinese economy. In reality, product “dumping” is a conscious decision at the core of the Chinese strategy of capturing global market share. Chinese companies are able to price below costs because they are subsidized by the state (and enjoy other cost advantages). And they know that companies in capitalist economies will not have the patience to suffer losses for more than a short period, after which they will cede market share and reallocate their capital to higher profit activities, including going bankrupt and returning capital to shareholders, or if they could get USG approval, selling their assets to a Chinese company. The CCP also knows that, for the most part, foreign governments have neither the fiscal capability nor the political will to subsidize their companies’ losses. And so, the bulldozer of value destruction keeps coming. We have already seen the results in an array of industries, including telecom equipment, commercial drones, solar panels, shipbuilding, bulk chemicals, LCD displays, and many others. And China is continuing to attack across a wide array of industries and technologies, including semiconductor memory and logic, biopharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, EVs and batteries, quantum computing, AI, aerospace, and others. If the United States, and the West more broadly, allows China to weaken and even destroy much of our advanced industry, America will look like the UK—largely an industrial and technology wasteland—and China will be the most powerful nation on earth, with attendant economic, military, and foreign policy consequences. China is a Marxist-Leninist dictatorship seeking global techno-economic domination by growing its own firms in virtually all emerging and foundational advanced technology industries. The intended casualty is the global market share and even the survival of Western and U.S. firms and industries. History has seen other campaigns such as this. From the late 1800s to World War II, Germany illustrated how trade could be weaponized into “an instrument of power, of pressure and even of conquest,” wrote the development economist Albert O. Hirschman. [43] Like China, Germany mostly focused on importing goods needed for its war machine, redirected trade to friendly or subject nations and sought to control oceanic trade routes, all in an effort to limit development of its adversaries. Like China, the German government kept its currency undervalued (making its goods relatively cheaper for consumers in other countries), leveraged the use of tariffs and subsidized its exports to bolster its position in industry goods such as steel, chemicals and machinery. If China was a “normal” country, focused on democracy, free trade, and generally market-oriented policies, there would be no need for this conversation. But China is not a normal country in the context of most other nations. First, despite what its leaders might present to the West, it is a Marxist-Leninist state. [44] After Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s, the CCP did not make the fatal mistakes the Soviets made of seeking a command economy where the state allocated resources. But it did not seek a market economy either. The CCP knew and knows what it wants the economy to evolve to—which, frankly, is not hard to know given a more than rudimentary understanding of industry and technology—and it sets directions. But, unlike the Soviets with their central planning from agencies such as Gosplan, the CCP lets companies do the rowing to get to the intended destination. The government’s job is to provide companies with a massive amount of help, including weakening their foreign competitors. Second, China has an overall power industry strategy, as well as scores if not hundreds of strategies for particular industries and technologies (e.g., medical devices). Because of that, most economic players row in the same direction. Local and provincial governments, financiers, companies, and entrepreneurs—they all are attuned to the direction CCP leadership wants them to go and, while there are certainly tensions and often massive waste (which Chinese citizens pay for with their underconsumption), there are also massive victories. Third, unlike the West, and particularly the Anglo-American West, China’s focus is not on the individual. Americans are bombarded on a daily basis with how this or that policy will affect their welfare as consumers (“Trump tariffs will raise prices!”), investors (“Trump tariffs will lower stock prices!”), workers (“AI will kill jobs!”), and residents (“These wind turbines will make noise!”). And the national interest is relegated to the bottom of the list, if it is even considered. Indeed, in this framing, there is no national interest, only the aggregate voices of individual interests as consumers, investors, workers and residents. As such, if something is good for the nation but raises prices, lowers stock values, eliminates jobs, or disrupts a neighborhood, it is, by definition, bad. Just as the U.S. economics profession embraced Ricardian trade theory and free-market economics, the U.S. political science profession, especially after the 1950s, embraced the theory of pluralism that held that the public interests was just the amalgam of competing interests. Academics such as Charles Lindblom, David Truman, and Robert Dahl led that charge. When a nation has to operate with those constraints, it is amazing that anything gets done other than what the most powerful forces can force through. If the United States, and the West more broadly, allows China to weaken and even destroy much of our advanced industry, America will look like the United Kingdom—largely an industrial and technology wasteland—and China will be the most powerful nation on earth, with attendant economic, military, and foreign policy consequences. On top of that, the overriding U.S. focus is on consumer orientation, what Keynes termed as “more jam today.” Harvard’s Bruce Scottt wrote in 1997 that “policies that favor consumption, consumer borrowing, and leisure are components of a consumer orientation. Public provision of enhanced economic security is also a consumer-oriented notion; it allows consumers to take less responsibility for themselves, and thus to leverage a given level of income with additional debt.” [45] We have only doubled down on that since Scott wrote those words, cutting taxes, massively expanding entitlements, and slashing true public investments. Lots of jam! China doesn’t worry about that. The CCP runs things—not investors, not consumers, not workers, and not residents. Chinese citizens can’t vote and have almost no voice in whether the CCP immiserates them in order to win the bigger, longer-term techno-economic war. Take peasants’ land to build a port? No problem. Keep the value of the RMB currency low so consumers pay more for imports? No problem. Put the pedal to the metal with robotic and other forms of automation, even if workers lose their jobs? No problem. The CCP doesn’t privilege self-interested individuals or organizations over the country as a whole, and as a result, it has much more smooth sailing to boost its national power industries. China has a producer orientation. As Scott wrote about Asian nations such as South Korea: [They are ]built on the notion of increased resource mobilization so as to have … “more jam tomorrow.” Producer-oriented nations favor saving and investment, technology acquisition, and skills upgrading through education and training, all of which imply less jam today as well as more tomorrow. In addition to increased resource mobilization, producer-oriented societies are characterized by market structures—capital, product, and labor—that permit producer institutions, firms, and associations to hold a great deal of power, while restricting that allowed to labor as well as to consumers. [46] To be clear, the United States should not adopt a repressive government. But Americans need to dial back selfishness and embrace more civic virtue, ending the focus on “more jam today” and replacing it with “more jam tomorrow.” Fourth, while America prioritizes allocation efficiency, the CCP prioritizes effectiveness of actions leading to increased industrial power. American elites see markets as an end because markets optimize efficiency. The CCP sees markets as just one of many tools to achieve its goal: global dominance in national power industries. That orientation is better for winning great power competition because markets are largely indifferent to winning or losing that competition. Markets are not indifferent to maximizing wealth, at least in the short run. But power and wealth are quite different things. And an economy that boasts the world’s most efficient personal services, utilities, hotel and lodging, and FIRE (finance, insurance, and real estate) sectors might be the richest. But an economy that can boast the largest national power industries will be the most powerful. Fifth, a key difference between China and the United States is an obvious one: China is not a democracy. The lack of democratic constraints on government means that the CCP can afford to spend enormous sums (direct and indirect tax expenditures) on supporting Chinese national power industries. Chinese citizens surely have some pain point over taxes, but it is clearly considerably lower than Americans’ pain point, as U.S. voters will go the ramparts if the gas tax is even indexed to inflation or if a politician even says they have considered a minor reduction in entitlements. America needs to stop focusing on “more jam today” and instead focus on “more jam tomorrow.” Sixth, like the Asian tigers (e.g., Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan) Chinese officials are steeped in the discipline of industrial and technology policy. Yes, there is scholarly industrial policy discipline to study, and it is largely ignored in the Anglo-Saxon and most European nations. However, Chinese officials study it intently. Most have read the “Adam Smith” of national developmentalism, Friedrich List, even if few American economists even know who he is. [47] In contrast, the level of education and knowledge of national developmentalism in the United States is minimal, with national policymakers usually having backgrounds in law. And economics does not involve the study of industry or technology, but rather how price-mediated markets work. And elite economists and policymakers look with disdain at the field of industrial policy and national developmentalism, if they even deign themselves to notice it at all. Seventh, Chinese governments support industrial policy research and analysis. The USG does not, and its economic statistics and technology system is designed to support market analysis and business cycle management, not power industry policy. And of course, every year, this system gets weaker with budget cuts. China also has a multitude of different agencies and bureaus to implement power industry policies. And we see that with the range of sophisticated techno-industrial policies, including China’s large and well-funded network of manufacturing innovation centers. [48] The United States has barely a few, some at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and DOD, but that is about it. Eighth, China sees itself in great power industry competition. Party congresses focus on this. Party newspapers constantly discuss it. Chinese leaders constantly discuss it. The United States largely does not. Most of the U.S. trade experts see trade as Ricardian win-win with countries not competing with each other. Trade policy is to reduce barriers to let markets become more efficient. To the extent elites consider U.S. competitiveness, most believe that we are far ahead of the Chinese and always will be because market economies produce superior outcomes compared with state-directed economies. Or, like Paul Krugman and so many other conventional economists, they deny that the United States competes at all with other economies. Hot-button issues of abortion, immigration, culture wars, health care, and the like, as well as inflation and stock prices, take up the attention of most U.S. policymakers. Ninth, Chinese officials are pragmatic. If letting companies have more leeway achieves CCP goals, they are for it. If winning requires more state involvement or even control, they are for that. In contrast, it is U.S. officials who are the ideologues. The CHIPS Act is opposed by the Right because it is too much government involvement. The Left opposes it because it commits the sin of helping corporations. Trump’s efforts to take equity share in companies are opposed, not because it might not lead to increased national power, but because it violates free-market principles. This ideological nature of U.S. thinking is why so many U.S. experts disparage China, as well as the very need for national power industries. If national power industries are important and if China is outperforming the United States, that poses a direct challenge to current trade and economic ideologies. This is why so many pundits have been arguing that we have seen “Peak China.” That way “nothing to see here, move on.” No need to do the painful examination of whether our current system works or needs a historic transformation. But Peak China is a fantasy; nothing could be farther than the truth. The demographic challenge they point to won’t really kick in for another decade or so as smaller, younger cohorts move into mid-career roles. Besides, there is every reason to expect that Chinese productivity growth will continue to outpace population decline, as well as U.S. growth rates. The same with the housing bubble-induced fiscal crisis. That is a business cycle challenge, not a growth challenge. Brooks and Vagle dismiss China’s techno-economic challenge because U.S. companies account for a larger share of global profits than Chinese firms. [49] But that is misleading for two reasons. U.S. profits overseas, especially in China, provide little in the way of national power. Second, low profits are a CCP tactic that lets Chinese firms gain global market share. Indeed, as a McKinsey Global Institute report points out, “Simply put, US manufacturing companies are expected to produce higher returns on capital than their competitors in the OECD and China.” [50] If national power industries are important and if China is outperforming the United States, that poses a direct challenge to current trade and economic ideologies. Some rightly point out that CCP has its own innovation bottlenecks—constraints in extreme-ultraviolet lithography, gallium nitride substrates, or advanced gene-therapy commercialization—that could limit Beijing’s ability to sustain techno-war pressures. There is no question that this is true. China is not all-powerful. But the CCP is making massive efforts to either replace Western capabilities or innovate around them with fundamentally new-to-the-world capabilities. Tenth and finally, China’s rulers are much more unified on national goals. While there are divides within the CCP, although they are likely fewer after Xi’s purges, the divides are not really about overarching goal. That remains, as China scholar Orville Schell wrote, wealth and power. In this case, the power of being a rich global hegemon dominating advanced industries. [51] Any differences are about how to achieve that goal, with XI and his faction focused more on techno-economic aggression while any reformers still left focused on using slightly less aggressive policies so as to reduce Western pushback. There used to be more unanimity around U.S. national goals, which changed and emerged after each major historical pivot. In his book Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy , Bill Janeway discussed how America had national missions from its founding: the Hamiltonian mission of building the country to be independent of England, the mission from Lincoln to FDR to become a great world industrial power and tying the country together, and the post-World War II Soviet containment mission through military offset technology. [52] During the Cold War, there was broad-based bipartisan consensus about not letting the Soviets win, with some seeking a Kenan-like containment and others seeking a Reagan-like victory. But the goal was the same. Today, America no longer has a unifying national mission or interests to rally around other than, for the Right, freedom, and for the Left (along with many on the “New Right,” such as American Compass), equity and redistribution. And for many, the dominant mission now is fighting climate change. For others, it is fighting against the takeover of the world by super AI. And overall, self-interest not only runs amok, but also has become the new civic religion. China doesn’t care about any of these matters. It is time for another historical pivot point when America’s new national mission becomes not losing the national power industry war to China. Today, America no longer has a unifying national mission or interests to rally around other than, for the Right, freedom, and for the Left, equity and redistribution. As discussed in the next section, there is considerable difference of opinion among U.S. foreign policy experts regarding China’s goals, and even fundamental nature, and as such a variety of strategic directions for the United States are offered. To the extent experts acknowledge China’s power industry actions, the consensus view is that the CCP is focusing on advanced industries either because they simply want to catch up to the West as any developing nation wants to do or they are reacting to Trump’s trade aggression and therefore are seeking to legitimately derisk from the United States. Likewise, the consensus view is that the CCP is seeking a seat at the global table in order to influence global issues. Finally, many experts see the CCP as being more capitalist than communist, and that, as such, it is more of a “normal” country than a Marxist-Leninist one. There are two principal problems with the consensus view. First, the view is likely wrong, stemming from a combination of wishful thinking and long-term intellectual commitments to positions held years if not decades ago but are now outdated. The view that the CCP is truly a Marxist-Leninist regime seeking to be the global hegemon and impose its governance structure on the world is actually likely to be the more accurate one. Second, even if the odds are that the consensus view is the correct one, especially that China is not seeking power industry dominance, it leads to a set of policies that, if right, can lead to an adequate outcome, but if wrong, to U.S. decline and subservience. If this is the case, it makes the struggle for global advanced industry leadership not only more important, but also central to the outcome. Finally, some believe that China has no desire or interest in having its power industry firms replace U.S. (and allied) power industry firms because then the CCP would have no leverage over our firms because there would be vastly fewer firms that buy from China. But this misses the point. The point is CCP leverage over the nation as a whole, and if it controls power industries, it has enormous power over Western nations. To better understand the CCP, we can look both at what the CCP says, especially domestically, and what the CCP does in terms of its national power industries’ policies. Ultimately, only time will tell which view is correct. But one insight into which is correct—China as a normal developing country or China as a hegemonic Marxist-Leninist regime set on global dominance of national power industries—is to review CCP writings and speeches. As Charles Parton wrote for the U.K. Council on Geostrategy: Internally, when promulgating to its members the speeches of Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), party documents and instructions, the CCP speaks of an ideological struggle between systems in which the People’s Republic of China (PRC) will gain domination over the United States (US). Externally, its foreign propaganda system derides the notion of a new cold war, and speaks of ‘win-win’ or ‘a community with a shared future for mankind… The second narrative is what it puts out to party members for guidance and reassurance. It is this which better represents its true intentions and therefore to which foreign governments should pay attention. [53] Perhaps the best analysis of these documents and statements comes from Daniel Tobin , professor of Practice at the U.S. National Intelligence University. In a May 7, 2025, article entitled “The Persistent, Soaring Ambitions of Xi Jinping’s ‘New Era’ for China, Socialism, and the Globe,” Tobin analyzed party documents, including Xi Jinping speeches and statements. [54] He wrote: In recent years, a growing number of external observers have rediscovered the value of CCP leadership speeches and policy documents as a vehicle for understanding the PRC’s intentions and actions. This is indeed the correct starting place. Owing to the CCP’s Leninist heritage, it uses ideology expressed in these venues as its instrument to depict, modify, and mobilize around its long-term goals, view of the external environment, and the policies designed to navigate toward its objectives. [55] His analysis suggests that the U.S. consensus view of China is wrong, and that indeed the CCP is a Marxist-Leninist party intent on advancing socialism globally against Western capitalism and democracy. He quoted Chinese Leader Xi: “The very purpose of the Party in leading the Chinese people in revolution, development, and reform is to make the people prosperous and the country strong, and rejuvenate the Chinese nation.” Parton added: Since 1992, the CCP’s constitution has maintained that: “The general starting point and criteria for judging each item of the Party’s work are that it must benefit the development of the socialist productive forces, be conducive to increasing socialist China’s comprehensive national power, and help to improve the people’s living standards.” Comprehensive national power, then, is both an end and a means to achieving the PRC’s overall goal of “national rejuvenation” become “a country with leading comprehensive national power and international influence.” In other words, the goal is not just to become a developed, modern strong country in absolute terms, but also a leading country in comparison with others. [56] But the consensus view is that China just wants to be strong, just as any large developing country wants to be. But Tobin disagreed: Indeed, while some external observers have rushed to point out that the official translation says a global leader not the global leader, it strains credibility that, already seeing itself as the number two power in the world as measured in computations of comprehensive national power, Beijing’s goal could be to work hard for several decades only to remain number two. In specific areas of international competition including economics, science and technology, innovation, and military capabilities, Xi repeatedly talks about “seizing the initiative,” and for and the need for China not to miss another historical opportunity to assume leadership. Indeed, a 2021 People’s Daily editorial under the pseudonym “Manifesto” ( 宣言 ), which Beijing has used several times to express the ambitions of the new era, maintains that “Gaining the upper hand in the competition of comprehensive national power is the key to national rejuvenation.” [57] He then wrote: Yet from Washington’s standpoint it ought to matter that Xi has been relentlessly consistent in framing the PRC as engaged in a systems contest with capitalism, where the CCP’s ability to navigate China to the status of the leading country in the world has implications for the rivalry between socialism and capitalism. [58] In his 19th Party Congress speech, Xi famously declared about the new era: It means that scientific socialism is full of vitality in 21st century China, and that the banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics is now flying high and proud for all to see. It means the path, the theory, the system, and the culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics have kept developing, blazing a new trail for other developing countries to achieve modernization. It offers a new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence: and it offers Chinese wisdom and a Chinese approach to solving the problems facing humanity. [59] Tobin went on to argue that “Xi Jinping, from his first days in office, has continued to underline these arguments for remaining committed to socialism; yet he also returned to the arguments about socialism’s inevitable international triumph that had not been emphasized since the Mao era.” [60] What is troubling is that most U.S. foreign policy experts don’t seem to take Xi seriously, assuming that he is simply mouthing Marxist-Leninist platitudes for the party faithful and doesn’t really mean it. This may be in part because they believe that only countries such as North Korea and the former Soviet Union are/were really Marxist. For them, “socialism with Chinese characteristics” is a slogan the CCP proselytizes to pacify the masses. Most U.S. foreign policy experts don’t seem to take Xi seriously, assuming that he is simply mouthing Marxist-Leninist platitudes for the party faithful and doesn’t really mean it. For them, “socialism with Chinese characteristics” is a slogan the CCP proselytizes to pacify the masses. Yet, as Tobin wrote, “In what would become a famous speech to party cadres at the provincial and ministerial level in early January 2013, underscoring the party’s commitment to the socialist project, Xi frames the contest as one of systems rivalry with capitalism, a contest in which China is behind but will catch-up.” [61] Tobin recounts that Xi stated: Reality has proved again and again that Karl Marx and Frederick Engels’ analysis of the fundamental contradiction in capitalist society is not obsolete, nor is the viewpoint of historical materialism that capitalism is doomed to failure and socialism will prevail. It is an irreversible trend of social development, but the process will be tortuous. It will be a long process that leads to the demise of capitalism and the victory of socialism. We must understand in depth the self-regulating capacity of capitalist society and fully recognize the objective reality that developed Western countries will dominate the economic, scientific, technological and military fields for a long time. We must prepare ourselves for long-term cooperation and rivalry between the two social systems…. The most important thing is that we focus on our development to increase our comprehensive national power, improve our people’s lives, and develop socialism that has more strengths than capitalism, so as to lay a solid foundation for us to seize the initiative, win the competitive edge, and secure our future. Our continued success in adapting Marxism to the Chinese context and the needs of our times has enabled Marxism to take on a fresh face in the eyes of the world, and significantly shifted the worldwide historical evolution of the contest between the two different ideologies and social systems of socialism and capitalism in a way that favors socialism. Tobin went on to note, “Further, Beijing maintained, owing to the PRC’s success, Xi Jinping Thought is: ‘the Marxism of contemporary China and of the 21st century’.” [62] What could be clearer than this? The key point of Tobin’s argument is thus: The thumbnail depiction common among US based China specialists that describes Beijing’s goals as ‘regional dominance and global influence’ undersells and does not comport with either Xi Jinping Thought or the PRC’s actions. On the contrary, Beijing has made it clear under Xi Jinping that it seeks a place of global leadership where the PRC’s proposed solutions to global problems and vision for the global order prevail…. Beijing makes clear that attaining the CCP’s objectives for the Chinese nation requires the construction of the global order along the lines the CCP favors. 103 It is risky to ignore the written words laying out the foreign policy goals of dictators, as Stalin learned to his dismay with Adolph Hitler, who in 1925 laid out in Mein Kampf (My Struggle) his goals of Lebensraum (living space) in the east and destroying Soviet communism. This is not simple economic competition, the frame that U.S. analysts, including economists, embrace. This is conflict between adversaries. As this all relates to national power industries, Tobin wrote, “The PRC further sees these technological frontiers as both an opportunity to seize the leading global position and shape how emerging norms and standards are set.” [63] And this is not simple economic competition, the frame that U.S. analysts, including economists, embrace. This is conflict between adversaries. Tobin also wrote that Xi “talks about the “great struggle” (a CCP euphemism for the systems contest with Western capitalist democracy), and trumpets “We must maintain strategic confidence and strengthen our fighting spirit.” [64] In summary, Tobin wrote: We ought to be able to put to bed suggestions that Beijing’s ambitions for its place in the world are regional (with merely “global influence” as the goal). Rather, the CCP’s vision is that its ideas and solutions become the foundation for the future global order and underpin the future of a deeply interconnected world and the future development of humanity as a whole. If there remained any doubts about the scope of US-PRC strategic rivalry, the 20th Party Congress and its aftermath should have answered them. [65] Charles Parton, a former British diplomat, made similar points. He wrote that, to replace the United States as the world’s leading superpower : [T]he CCP under Xi sees itself engaged in a fierce ‘struggle’ against ‘hostile foreign forces’. For all its accusations that ‘certain countries’ are guilty of a ‘cold war mentality’, the CCP itself is in no doubt that this is a cold war— and an ideological one. As Xi has said, ‘competition between systems is an important aspect of competition for comprehensive national power’, and the dominance of a system gives a country the dominant position in winning the ‘strategic initiative.’ [66] He went on to quote one CCP official: “International struggles are becoming increasingly fierce, and system confrontation has become a prominent feature of the game between major powers. The US suppression [of us] is a major threat but [our struggle with the US] is both a skirmish and a protracted war.” [67] He cited another CCP official with a similar tone of belligerency: “The strategic contest between China and the United States is bound to last for a long period of time, for which we must be fully prepared ideologically and work.” [68] He discussed how the minister of Science and Technology wrote in the People’s Daily , the CCP’s newspaper: [T]he scientific and technological revolution and the contest between major powers are intertwined; the high-tech field has become the forefront and main battlefield of international competition, profoundly influencing the global order and development pattern…the competition between countries is a competition of strength. What is crucial is the competition of scientific and technological innovation capabilities. The underlying contest is about whose system is superior. [69] As such, the CCP sees technology as a core component of national power. Parton went on to discuss how: Influential commentaries and articles in party media at the time of the First Session of the 14th NPC in 2023 made that point clearly: To a certain extent, those who gain access to the internet will gain the world. Seizing the historical opportunity of the information revolution is a major strategic decision related to the construction of a strong country and national rejuvenation. Core technology is an important weapon for the country….Only by holding key core technologies in our own hands can we fundamentally guarantee national economic security, national defence security, and other security. [70] In “A Vision of Success in the U.S.-China Rivalry: The Technological Competition,” Michael J. Mazarr, senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation, wrote: There can be little doubt that Beijing aims to be the unquestioned global leader in a whole series of science- and technology-based industries, from 5G and renewable energy to electric vehicles and biotechnology. (In parallel, it is seeking dominance in less technologically cutting-edge industries such as shipbuilding.) How precisely China defines success in these terms is not clear, although in some cases, such as solar panels, it has achieved something close to a global monopoly position in manufacturing, and in 5G China was apparently seeking to position Huawei similarly as the overwhelmingly dominant global actor. This position of technological overmatch would consequently provide Beijing with tremendous leverage in its broader effort to achieve global leadership. China’s favored end state in the technology competition therefore envisions overall supremacy in many critical fields, all of which can be employed for broader geostrategic effect. [71] We see this focus on influence and struggle in terms of how the CCP conceives of industry. Whereas U.S. thinkers see economic policy as enabling allocation efficiency with no other industry more important than another, CCP officials have a different view. An interview with Lu Feng, a leading professor at Peking University’s School of Government, specializing in industrial policy, technological innovation, and development, gives a sense of this difference. [72] In the interview, cross-posted in the Substacks High Capacity and Sinification , Feng argues that China needs even more industrial development because it is a “strategic asset.” [73] According to interviewers Kyle Chan and colleagues, “Lu Feng argues that China’s industrial base is its ‘greatest source of strength” and a ”strategic asset” akin to U.S. dollar hegemony or Russian oil and gas.” [74] Professor Wang Yu of the Nanjing University Business School said the same in March: The essence of competition among major countries is scientific and technological competition ... The strategic value of strategic emerging industries and future industries lies in their fundamental impact on the future industrial status of various countries, reshape the international division of labor, and enhance national discourse power. [75] Whereas U.S. thinkers see economic policy as enabling allocation efficiency with no other industry more important than another, CCP officials have a different view. The CCP laid out its game plan in China’s Made in China: 2025 plan that calls for China to become a global advanced manufacturing “powerhouse.” [76] The plan stated: Since the beginning of industrial civilization in the middle of the 18 th century, the history of the rise and fall of world powers and the history of the struggle of the Chinese nation has repeatedly proved that without a strong manufacturing industry, there will be no country and no nation. Building an internationally competitive manufacturing industry is the only way China can enhance its comprehensive national strength, ensure national security, and build itself into a world power. It must look to the world, step up strategic deployment, focus on building a manufacturing powerhouse, shore up its roots, and turn challenges into opportunities to seize the commanding heights of a new round of competition in the manufacturing industry. By the 100th anniversary of the founding of New China, the country’s status as a manufacturing industry power must be consolidated, and its comprehensive strength must enter the forefront of the world’s manufacturing powerhouses. The main areas of the manufacturing industry must be innovation-led with obvious competitive advantages, and we will build a world-leading technology system and industrial system. China’s National 13th Five-Year Plan for the Development of Strategic Emerging Industries also gives several indication of the CCP’s intention dominate power industries, including: Industry innovation capabilities must rank first globally, forming first-mover advantages in several major sectors. By 2020, … the self-sufficiency rate for major key materials reaches over 70% to initially realize the strategic transformation of China from materials power to materials superpower. Promote domestic enterprises and Chinese-foreign enterprises in jointly developing international markets, support the “going global” of the supply chain to feed high-quality assets, technology, and management experience from “going global” back to China and form comprehensive competitive advantages. [77] Chan wrote: The US-China rivalry ultimately as a contest between two systems: China’s “industrial socialism” and America’s “financial capitalism.” The US was once an industrial powerhouse like China today with half of global production and an “arsenal of democracy” that changed the course of World War II. But, in a critique with strong political resonance within the US, Lu Feng says the US economy became increasingly “financialized,” dominated by the short-term interests of Wall Street investors, causing America’s industrial base to atrophy. In contrast, China’s socialist system ensured that financial resources would be directed toward supporting the “real economy” and steer China away from the standard path of deindustrialization. [78] China is working on a Made in China: 2035 plan that aims to surpass the United States in all advanced production industries. Lu Yongxiang, former vice-chairman of the National People’s Congress, in a commentary published in 2024 in the “Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering” stated, “It is estimated that by 2035, ‘Made in China’ will surpass the United States and become the global leader.” [79] He went on to note, “‘Irreversible US production declines amid an expanding Chinese economy will thrust world into a new era.” Note “U.S. declines” and “new era.” The CCP knows that its effort to lead the world cannot come without absolute U.S. decline in advanced industries. And the new era refers to an era in which China is dominant. And as Xi Jinping has stated, “Technological innovation has become the main battleground of the global playing field, and competition for tech dominance w ill grow unprecedentedly fierce.” [80] Note the terms “battlefield” and “dominance.” Likewise, as a CCP report titled “General Laws of the Rise of Great Powers” states, “Becoming a major manufacturing power provides crucial security for the goal of realizing the Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation.” [81] In an article in state-run publication, the author wrote: ‘Advancing Chinese-style Modernization Requires Handling Several Major Relationships Well,’ General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out the need to ‘strengthen national strategic scientific and technological capabilities, guided by national strategic needs, focus on original and leading scientific and technological research, and resolutely win the battle to overcome key core technologies. [82] Likewise, in the CCP-controlled publication Peoples Forum , Wei Ziping, a teacher at the School of Public Administration and Law, Anhui University of Technology, wrote in 2023 that China needs to “accelerate progress toward our goal of leading the world in key core technologies, build China into a global power in science and technology, expand the space for Chinese-style modernization through institutionalized, high-level openness and cooperation, and realize the Chinese Dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.” [83] One leading Chinese scholar spoke at a major conference, “The competition for the Fourth Industrial Revolution will be held between China and the US. But America also suffers from the diseases of neoliberal politics. Its prospects are not bright. For China this once-in-a-century race is an opportunity.” [84] Former Deputy National Security Advisor Matt Pottinger describes a meeting during the first Trump administration with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing: Addressing Trump from across the table, Premier Li painted a menacing picture of the not-so-distant future. China, he said, would completely dominate this century’s most important technologies, including artificial intelligence. The world would become more dependent on China than ever before. The United States, Li said, was destined to export little more to China than soybeans and corn. To add insult to injury, Li said Beijing would purchase substitutes for U.S. agriculture if the Communist regime was unhappy with Washington for one reason or another. [85] Maybe this was bluster, or maybe he was turning over this cards to show the CCP’s hand. Either way, there is increasing evidence that China is preparing for a major external crisis; what Xi calls “extreme-case” situations, or “jiduan qingkuang.” Whether that is war, we do not know. [86] What Rand Scholar Jimmy Goodrich calls China’s “fortress economy” involves both defense and offense. [87] None of this is the language of nation seeking to just move up the development ladder; it is language of power and domination. [88] The CCP knows that its effort to lead the world cannot come without absolute U.S. decline in advanced industries. And the new era refers to an era in which China is dominant. CCP leaders are savvy enough to not explicitly show their hand, at least in venues that Westerners are likely to come across. After many nations expressed alarm, CCP officials understood that they were in error when they were so explicit about their goals for industrial power in Made in China: 2025. Shortly thereafter, Chinese leaders quietly dropped most if not all references to it, even as they doubled down on its implementation. [89] But that does not mean that it is still not their strategy. The title of Rush Doshi’s book, The Long Game: China’s Grand Strategy to Displace American Order , says it all. This is not just about China rising, but also about China displacing the United States and other Western leaders, and the techno-economic battlefield is where much of the conflict will be fought. He writes that China’s strategy is to displace the United States, including in the techno-economic sphere, and it uses predatory practices to accomplish that. [90] U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a report when he was the chair of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, concluding that China was doing more than “breaking the rules” to dominate high-value industrial sectors. [91] This helps explain why, despite a highly polarized political climate, Congress managed to pass the CHIPS and Science Act, which invests billions of dollars to support new semiconductor factories in the United States. Nothing promotes unity like a shared and frightening enemy. In a report for the Hoover Institution—“Economic Statecraft: The Need For An Integrated Approach”—H.R. McMaster and Andrew Grotto discussed the need for the USG to “exercise broad discretion to intervene in the economy to address a threat emanating from overseas (e.g. China).” [92] It rightly argues: US administrations consistently undervalue the degree to which strategic application of economic power is essential for advancing US vital interests…The United States must act to counter Chinese economic aggression—nonmarket actions intended to harm American companies, impair US manufacturing, or coerce the United States and its allies. [93] In Getting China Wrong, Princeton University scholar Aaron Friedberg argued that: Growth and development have not caused China’s rulers to relax their grip on political power, abandon their mercantilist economic policies, or accept the rules and norms of the existing international system. To the contrary: China today is more repressive at home, more aggressive abroad, and more obviously intent on establishing itself as the world’s preponderant power than at any time since the death of Chairman Mao. Likewise, as Fredberg noted, “The key to understanding Xi’s economic policies is to recognize that they are principally about power, not prosperity. He will almost certainly forge ahead toward concentrating the world’s industrial power within China.” [94] He went to write: Rather than letting the free play of market forces and the principle of comparative advantage determine the international distribution of industrial capacity, it seeks deliberately to build “national champions,” helping them to acquire and “indigenize” critical technologies and supporting their efforts to dominate domestic and global markets for cutting-edge products. [95] Finally, an anonymous author of an Atlantic Council report entitled “The Longer Telegram” warned that implementing an effective China strategy would “require a firm understanding of Xi’s strategic objectives, which include the following: leapfrog the United States as a technological power and thereby displace it as the world’s dominant economic power.” [96] China follows a predictable playbook for trying to dominate advanced industries. Even with what should be compelling evidence of the CCP’s intent, there will be those who say that these words are for internal consumption and don’t reflect the CCP’s external goals. Or that these translations make subtle but important mistakes that distort meaning. To those, I would argue, look at what the CCP has been doing. China follows a predictable playbook for trying to dominate advanced industries. The first step is to attract foreign investment. In the early 1980s, when Deng Xiaoping opened up the Chinese economy to foreign investment, his main economic development strategy sought principally to induce foreign multinationals to shift relatively low- and moderate-value production to China. [97] China is still trying to do that today with emerging industries, seeking, for example, to attract global biopharmaceutical companies to build facilities in China. China’s second step is to attempt to learn from foreign companies, in part by having them train Chinese executives, scientists, and engineers, and also by forced technology transfer, including through joint ventures. In 2015, 6,000 new international joint ventures, amounting to $27.8 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, were established in China. [98] And the sophistication and value of the technology the Chinese government has demanded is high. As the United States Trade Representative’s (USTR’s) Office pointed out in its 2018 Special 301 report on China, pressures on U.S. companies to form joint ventures and transfer technology “is particularly intense.” [99] Figure 1: 1958 CCP poster exhorting Chinese workers and companies to “surpass Britain in 15 years” in industrial production [100] The third step is to support Chinese companies in their efforts to copy and incorporate foreign technology while building up domestic capabilities. One important marker for the transition from stage two to stage three was the publication in 2006 of the “National Medium- and Long-term Program for Science and Technology Development (2006–2020),” which called on China to master 402 core technologies—everything from intelligent automobiles to integrated circuits and high-performance computers. China moved to a “China Inc.” development model of indigenous innovation, which focused on helping Chinese firms, especially those in advanced, innovation-based industries, often at the expense of foreign firms. The fourth step is to enable Chinese firms to become independent innovators. China is attempting to do this through an array of plans and policies: “13th Five-Year Plan for Science and Technology,” “13th Five-Year Plan for National Informatization,” “The National Cybersecurity Strategy,” and “Made in China 2025 Strategy,” and most recently Xi Jinping’s call at the 20th Party Congress for “invigorating China through science and education ... for the strategy of innovation-driven development .” [101] A key part of this step is to squeeze out the foreign companies that they had initially invited in. The Chinese market essentially becomes dominated by Chinese-owned firms. We have seen this an array of industries, including chemicals, telecom equipment, heavy construction equipment, high-speed rail, and renewable energy. The CCP then carves out and preserves the Chinese market for Chinese firms. For example, the Chinese government included 57 domestic auto battery makers in the catalog, meaning that foreign giants such as Samsung, LG, and Panasonic were excluded. [102] This demonstrates how China protects its domestic champions while they build capacity for international expansion. The final step is to then support these companies “going out” and taking market share in other parts of the world. Unfortunately, for gaining political support for a robust U.S. strategy to respond to China, the United States is among the last places Chinese firms will seek to enter. Rather, they are going after market share in places such as Latin America, Southeast Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe, the “soft underbelly” of global markets. As their firms gain market share, Western—including U.S.—firms, lose market share, and tipping points can happen quite quickly. China backs this all up by massive subsidies to its industries. Firms often have to compete in “unfair” markets, if only because many factors affect the value of currency. Hence, firms can find themselves with an uncompetitive cost structure in global markets even though they are doing everything right. But leaving this aside, firm competition plays out through several key factors, with price and quality being the most important. If one firm is provided subsidies (including a devalued currency), it has—all else equal—a competitive advantage over its foreign competitors that receive limited subsidies. The firm can use that advantage to cut prices and gain market share. It can boost its scale and learning economies. Or it can invest those subsidies in R&D and other areas to boost quality and innovation, again taking market share from its competitors. China’s subsidies are on steroids because of the intense competition for industry between its cities and provinces, which shell out massive funds to support local champions. And it ignores the supposed WTO disciplines on subsidies. While a number of nations have relied on many forms of subsidies (low corporate taxes, tax incentives, grants, subsidized costs of inputs such as energy, and a suppressed value of their currency), by and large, the scale of the subsidies is usually limited, often by domestic political pressures from voters demanding lower taxes or higher spending to directly benefit them. At the same time, many Western nations implement various subsidy-limitation measures because they want competition to be on a level playing field. But China is exempt from all of those limitations. China’s subsidies are on steroids, in part because of the intense competition for industry between its cities and provinces, which shell out massive funds to support local champions. And China flouts the flaccid WTO disciplines on subsidies. The magnitude and extent of Chinese subsidies have been widely documented. Though dated, Haley and Haley’s book Chinese Industrial Subsidies documents just how sizeable these were and the role they played in enabling China to gain global market share in the 2000s. More recently, Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) found, “Even using a conservative methodology, China’s industrial policy spending is enormous, totaling at least 1.73 percent of GDP in 2019. This is equivalent to more than $248 billion at nominal exchange rates and $407 billion at purchasing power parity exchange rates.” [103] A new study from a German institute estimates, “Overall, industrial subsidies in China are several times higher than those in large EU and OECD countries. The size of the estimated difference ranges from a ratio of at least three to four in conservative estimates to a ratio of as high as nine in more encompassing studies.” [104] In 2022, 99 percent of listed firms in China received direct government subsidies. For example, the German study finds that Chinese EV maker BYD has received over $3.7 billion in subsidies. Overall, in 2019, Chinese industrial subsidies were 4.5 times greater than the United States as a share of GDP, and that is accounting for the U.S. subsidies related to national defense and government support for scientific research. [105] Hand in hand with subsidies are market access restrictions. The first directly helps a domestic company gain market share; the second helps indirectly by reducing the market share of a foreign competitor and increasing that domestic firm’s share. For example, when the Chinese government tells its state-owned telecom providers to stop using American computer chips in their systems, it weakens companies such as Intel and AMD while strengthening Chinese companies such as SMIC. China’s massive size means that it an and is seeking competitive advantage in every technology, current and emerging. In comparison, Japan in the 1980s and 1990s sought and gained advantage in significantly fewer sectors (e.g., consumer electronics, steel, autos, and chemicals). This size also means that because China manages its market and limits foreign sales once its firms get to a certain scale, Chinese firms are blessed with massive, largely secure market revenues, and this includes massive government subsidies. In addition, the scope of state power to punish foreign firms and favor domestic ones is unprecedented. By cutting off foreign firms (or reducing their China revenue) while bestowing lavish benefits on its own firms, Chinese firms are able to sell below cost for many years, if not decades, all with the goal of taking market share away from global leaders. Japanese firms also did that, but to a much more limited extent. China’s massive size means that it can and is seeking competitive advantage in every technology, current and emerging. In comparison, Japan in the 1980s and 1990s sought and gained advantage in significantly fewer sectors. One reason why international trade theory holds that low-wage countries won’t dominate global trade because of their low costs is that they also have low productivity. Thus, when pundits warn that the United States can’t compete with low-wage nations because of our higher labor costs, they are ignoring the fact that what matters is productivity-adjusted labor costs. And it is a normal pattern of development that labor costs in virtually all countries tend to track labor productivity quite closely. According to Claude AI, there is a 0.88 correlation between labor costs and national labor productivity, just as we would expect. The average ratio of wages to productivity for 42 countries is 0.51, and in the United States it is 0.53, whereas in China it is just 0.24. In other words, if Chinese wages were half of Chinese productivity levels, as is the case in virtually all other nations, then wages in China would be twice as high, significantly reducing its competitive advantage in global markets. One recent study examined five manufacturing industries, including electric vehicles, shipbuilding, and steel and argued that for a variety of reasons the Chinese government undercounts industry productivity. [106] The author found that physical output per worker averaged 2.4 times higher than U.S. output per worker, and value-added per worker was 20 percent higher, on average. Assuming that the value-added measure is a more accurate, apples-to-apples comparison, this means that China’s cost-to-productivity ratio is between 6 and 12 times greater than the U.S. ratio, given that Chinese workers earn around 20 percent of U.S. workers’ wages in dollar terms. This suggests that China is breaking the historical model for developing nations, where wages track productivity. The PRC is making sure that the benefits of productivity don’t go to Chinese workers but rather to foreign consumers who can buy cheaper products, with the goal of driving foreign producers out of business. This is consistent with a longstanding CCP pattern of giving short shrift to nonmanufacturing productivity growth and instead maintaining a laser-like focus on raising productivity in manufacturing. While up-to-date quantitative data is not available, it is clear that China is doubling down on this approach in manufacturing. ITIF has calculated that, in 2021, China had 12 times more robots in use per manufacturing worker as did the United States when controlling for wage levels (higher-wage nations should have more robots than should low-wage nations). [107] In 2022, China had 59 percent more robots per manufacturing worker than did the United States. [108] And it installed more robots than the rest of the world combined did. [109] It is encouraging highly automated factories, including so-called “dark factories” with very few workers. This suppression of manufacturing labor costs coupled with acceleration of manufacturing productivity through automation appears to be gaining in focus in China, and is a powerful weapon for gaining global market share. The PRC is making sure that the benefits of productivity don’t go to Chinese workers but rather to foreign consumers who can buy cheaper products, with the goal of driving foreign producers out of business. As noted, the CCP knows that if it clearly articulates its techno-economic war strategy that it will mobilize both defensive and offensive reaction from the West. And so, of course, it does not. But one way we can get a sense of it is by examining China’s global business expansion strategy. If China were only focused on gaining self-reliance from the United States it would be much less focused on gaining global market share. China’s “Going Out” ( 走出去 ) policy is a comprehensive government strategy launched in the early 2000s to encourage Chinese companies to expand internationally. The government encouraged companies to “go further outwards” (Jinyibu zouchuqu) in its 11th Five-Year Plan (2006–2010). Government policies encouraged Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and private enterprises to pursue investments in markets around the world, resulting in the internationalization of SOEs. The government specifically uses SOEs as vehicles for international expansion, providing them with preferential treatment and resources. China’s sovereign funds have also supported efforts to Go Out, including by helping Chinese enterprises finance mergers and acquisitions abroad. In 2015, for example, China Investment Corporation turned one of its divisions into the wholly owned subsidiary CIC Capital. This provided Chinese companies with massive capital backing for overseas acquisitions. And of course, its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) represents the most ambitious manifestation of the Going Out strategy. In the first 10 years of the initiative (2013–2023), China inked roughly $1 trillion worth of investment and construction deals with BRI countries [110] Between 2000 and 2022, Chinese financiers committed to lending or donating $1.34 trillion to low- and medium-income countries—nearly $800 billion of this was in the first decade of the BRI from 2013 to 2022. [111] The Chinese state is the underwriter for the initiative, via its four state-owned banks lending to SOEs. [112] At the same time, PRC banks provide vastly more support for foreign investment than do USG institutions. [113] Box 2: Chinese Competition and American Deindustrialization: A Financial Framework [114] Different financial systems help determine the outcomes of the techno-economic war. China’s system is designed to aggressively destroys Western company value. The U.S. system is designed to maximize short-term wealth creation and is agnostic toward national industrial power competition. The U.S. Economic Model Publicly traded corporations in capital-intensive sectors (e.g., industrials) optimize three key variables. The first is economic value added (EVA). EVA equals return on invested capital (ROIC) minus the weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (ROIC - WACC) times the amount of invested capital (IC). The weighted average cost of capital for U.S. firms is around 8–10 percent. ROIC equals net operating profit after tax NOPAT divided by invested capital. Profit margins are calculated in various ways. Gross margin is sales minus the cost of goods and production labor. From an industrial standpoint, the most relevant profit margin is the gross margin. The others are influenced by a firm’s overhead expenses and its tax, investment, and capital strategy. The U.S. model is more financialized and focus on higher, short-term returns than other capitalist economies. But China is in a completely different model. The Chinese Economic Model Chinese firms systematically generate ROIC well below American WACC thresholds. The Chinese semiconductor firm SMIC, for example, posts approximately 4.5 percent ROIC versus around 12 to 16 percent global semiconductor industry WACC, creating negative EVA by American standards. Chinese EVA = (4.5% - 12%) × IC = -7.5% × IC. In other words, Chinese firms can survive on ROIC that is less than the cost of capital in the United States. This economic value destruction manifests as the “China price”—aggressive pricing that destroys gross margins industry-wide. Chinese firms partially compensate through higher capital turns (sales/IC), enabled by rapid market expansion and debt-financed growth. Chinese firms can do this because of overall financial repression in China. The PRC prevents savers from getting normal returns, and its capital controls on foreign investment preclude outside options. Both lower the cost of capital. [115] At the same time Chinese companies are pressured by the PRC to accept low returns and provided with low-cost capital from state-owned banks in order to gain market share. [116] American Industrial Response Faced with Chinese “scorched earth” competition, U.S. firms can generally only pursue two strategies that make up essentially the mirror image of Chinese value destruction: Strategy 1: Asset-Light Retrenchment Given this unbeatable competition, one strategy is for U.S. firms to reduce their IC base through outsourcing of production assets to someone else’s balance sheet. At the same time, they focus on capital-light activities with higher margins, such as design, sales and market, and software. And they tend to limit expensive investments in capital equipment. Strategy 2: Cost Reduction for Margin Protection A second strategy is offshore supply chains and production of lower-cost inputs to preserve gross margins. At the same time, they are forced to press for lower prices from domestic suppliers and workers. Capital Allocation Logic: Both of these strategies are additionally supported by a capital strategy that increases earnings per share. In particular, the companies use freed-up cash for share buybacks. Since earnings per share equals Net Income divided by the number of outstanding shares, so EPS can go up with stock buy backs. With Chinese competitors destroying economic value while gaining market share, new productive investments cannot be justified. The rational response for these companies is returning cash to investors through share buybacks, inflating EPS even as the industrial base shrinks. Deindustrialization Outcome Both strategies hollow out domestic industrial capacity: Strategy 1 directly reduces the manufacturing base, while Strategy 2 degrades supplier ecosystems and workforce capabilities. The result is a self-reinforcing cycle wherein American firms lose the ability to scale innovation and compete in advanced manufacturing, validating Andy Grove’s 2010 warning about the strategic risks of abandoning production competencies. While some populists on the Right and the Left decry U.S. industrial corporations for taking these steps, accusing them of being profit hungry, this is too narrow a focus. The normal rate of capital returns in normal market economies is above 8 to 12 percent, given the cost of capital. No company can survive earning less than the cost of its capital. As such, if these companies tried to do that to meeting the China price, rational shareholders, including labor union pension funds, would invest in other sectors and companies that do not face this constraint, such as insurance and banking, logistics, and entertainment. Rather than engage in emotionally satisfying and politically rewarding hectoring of selfish U.S. capitalists, a better strategy is to limit Chinese scorched earth competition while providing targeted incentives for national power industries to stay in the fight and keep investing. Perhaps the fundamental flaw in the thinking of most in the U.S. foreign policy establishment, including the mass of pundits, journalists, think tank scholars, and academics is their dismissal of the importance of national power industries and lack of understanding of how these industries actually work. Most in the foreign policy establishment are educated in everything but how national power industries work. A random case in point: Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Affairs Masters’ Program curriculum. Students focus on international relations, regional studies, and language studies. But they also must take a set of courses on international economics. This sounds promising, until looking at the courses: “[T]he Economics I track covers topics in Microeconomics and International Trade Theory, and the Economics II track covers topics in Macroeconomics and International Finance. The Essentials courses are more conceptual in nature and require only basic math skills.” [117] As noted, these have almost nothing to do with business strategy, technology development, or industrial policy. Harvard’s course list for its international relations master’s program includes courses such as “Globalization and the Nation State” and “The Evolution of Deterrence Theory.” Out of around 50 courses, there is just 1 that might bear on the U.S.-China tech war and that is “ The Geopolitics of Technology,” but like most of the limited focus in U.S. graduate school International relations, they are on the internet, exploring things like cybersecurity, ethical issues in AI, and cybersecurity.” [118] Tuft’s Flecther School of Global Affairs seems more promising, offering an entire program on “Technology and International Affairs” but it too is focused on the Internet and cyber. [119] It’s International Economic Relations track seems promising, but it is neoclassical international economics, not power economics. Its International Security track is promising, but this is related to military issues, and of course, cyber conflict. Perhaps the fundamental flaw in the thinking of most in the U.S. foreign policy establishment is their dismissal of the importance of national power industries and lack of understanding of how they work. To be sure, these kinds of courses are quite important for being able to effectively study and participate in U.S. international relations, but they have little or nothing to do to prepare the student for understanding the importance of power trade, much less being able to understand what to do. As one distinguished U.S. foreign policy official said to me, “I wish we had learned technology in the foreign policy establishment, given how central it is now to the field.” Well, they didn’t and therefore they give technology and national power industries short shrift. And we see that in most foreign policy books on China, including the excellent new book by China foreign policy expert George Shambaugh, Breaking the Engagement , where technology is hardly mentioned. They stick with what they know best: diplomacy, foreign policy, great power, competition, human rights, etc. The U.S. foreign policy experts completely ignored the reality, possibility, and success of the Chinese techno-economic war in part because they denied the reality that certain industries provided power. They wanted a relationship that, as Shambaugh wrote, “would become more stable, productive and manageable. The more threads tying down the relationship like Gulliver, the more impediments there would be to systemic disruption.” [120] But what disruption? For them, disruption meant not talking. They ignored the erosion eating into U.S. national power industry strengths. Pushing back against that would hurt the most important thing: dialogue. If the lion’s share of the U.S. foreign policy establishment ignore industry, perhaps with exception of defense contractors and large Internet platforms, the MAGA right loves all industry and wants to reindustrialize America, from baseball mitts to biotechnology. What America needs is a “third way” for trade grounded in strategic industry trade policy based on the realization that some industries matter far more than others. The conventional view is that the only industries that matter to national power are defense industries. But that is now vastly too limiting. As Corelli Barnett, wrote, “For munitions production for modern war is not primarily a question of specialized armament industries, as some suppose, but of all those varied industrial and scientific resources that in peacetime make for a successful and expanding export trade.” [121] As such, ITIF has developed a classification of U.S. industries for their relevance to national power. This can be viewed as a continuum between defense industries on one side, nonstrategic industries on the other, and strategic industries and strategic enabling industries in the middle. See figure 2. Figure 2: Industrial power scale At one end of the continuum are defense industries. Clearly industries such as ammunition, guided missiles, military aircraft and ships, tanks, drones, defense satellites, and others are strategic. Not having world class innovation and production capabilities in these industries means a weakened military capability. Policymakers across the aisle generally (with the exception of the isolationist Right and the pacifist Left) agree that these industries are strategic and that market forces alone will not produce the needed results. At the other end of the spectrum are industries in which the United States has no real strategic interests. These include furniture, coffee and tea manufacturing, bicycles, carpet and rug mills, window and door production, plastic bottle manufacturing, wind turbine production, lawn and garden equipment, sporting goods, jewelry, caskets, toys, toiletries, running shoes, etc. If worst came to worst and our adversaries (e.g., China) gained dominance in any of these industries and decided to cut America off, we’d survive—in part, because none of these are critical to the running of the U.S. economy, as many are final goods that might inconvenience consumers but wouldn’t cripple any industries, and also because, in most cases, domestic production could be started or expanded relatively easily because none of these products are all that technological complex from either a product or process concern and the barriers to entry are relatively low. Next to defense industries dual-use industries are critical to American strength. Losing aerospace, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, semiconductors, displays, advanced software, fiber optic cable, telecom equipment, machine tools, motors, measuring devices, and other dual-use sectors would give our adversaries incredible leverage over America. Just the threat to cut these off (assuming that they have also deindustrialized our allies in these sectors) would immediately bring U.S. policymakers to the bargaining table. National power industries tend to also need global scale in order to complete. Moreover, many are intermediate goods such as semiconductors and chemicals, where a cutoff would cripple many other industries. Finally, these industries are hard to stand up once they’re lost because of the complexity of the production process, product knowledge, and the importance of the industrial commons that support them. In other words, barriers to entry are high and, if lost, would be very difficult and expensive to reconstitute. What America needs is a “third way” for trade grounded on strategic industry trade policy based on realization that some industries matter far more than others. Finally, there are enabling industries. These are industries wherein, if the United States were cut off, the immediate effects on military readiness would be small. And the U.S. economy could survive for at least a while without production. America could survive for many years without an auto sector, as we would all just drive cars longer. But because of the nature of these industries—including technology development, process innovation, skills, and supporting institutions—their loss would harm both dual-use and defense industries. That is because enabling industries contribute to the industrial commons that support dual-use defense industries. A severely weakened motor vehicle sector would weaken the tank and military vehicle ecosystem. Similarly, a weakened commercial shipbuilding sector has weakened military shipbuilding. A weakened consumer electronics sector weakens military electronics. We can see this in China, whereby the fact that it employs 213 million manufacturing workers, including engineers and technicians, gives it an enormous sophisticated and dynamic production system with synergies and spillovers between enabling industries, national power industries, and defense industries. Indeed, China does not and cannot draw firm lines between civil and military industries and technologies, and instead tries to fuse them. In a companion report to this one, ITIF has put the 970 industries classified by the North American Industry Classification codes into the four categories. [122] Power industries account for 22.3 percent of the industries. (See figure 3 below and table 2 in the third appendix.) Most industries are not power industries, in large part because most are nontraded sectors such as law firms and barber shops. Of the 22.3 percent that are power industries, just 0.5 percent are defense industries, and 13.4 percent are dual use. The remaining 8.4 percent are enabling industries. In terms of employment, in 2022, just 9.5 percent of workers were employed in power industries. Of this, 6.4 percent worked in dual-use industries and 2.9 percent in enabling industries, and just 0.2 percent were employed in defense industries. Figure 3: Breakdown of six-digit NAICS industries according to ITIF’s national power industry typology As such, trade policy should be focused first and foremost on defense, strategic, and enabling sectors and largely ignore nonstrategic. The problem is that Trumpian economic nationalism, at least as represented by some of his key officials, sees all four as equally worth of protection. Why else would Trump fight Canada so hard for dairy and wood products trade, clearly nonpower sectors. Likewise, why else would the administration push so hard for natural gas and farm product exports? Boosting exports of the former will reduce American fossil fuel resources, while boosting exports of the latter will do little to increase American food security. At the same time, policymakers lack two key insights needed to respond in effective ways. The first is that some industries are strategic. Yet, both political parties have embraced a “potato chips, computer chips, what’s the difference?” mentality. The head of one of the leading international economic policy think tanks in Washington said when asked how much manufacturing the United States could lose and still be okay, “All of it.” Today, the Trump tariffs are anything but strategic, with the view that the chicken industry is as important as the chip industry. The intent of this project is to change that so that there is a broader consensus around Washington on the criticality of strategic industries for the Republic’s future. 1. Global trade is particularly important in most national power trade industries, particularly dual use. These industries are different in core ways from other industries. Given their high fixed costs relative to marginal costs and the fact that they must reinvest profits to produce the required next round of innovation, firms in these industries require access to global markets. 2. In addition, firms in these industries are much more susceptible to dying. If CCP competitors can gain enough global market share, they can enter into a virtuous cycle of more revenue, more profits, and more investment in the next round of innovation and so on. Conversely, firms that lose market share risk falling into a death spiral, where they invest less in R&D and new product development and process innovation, and therefore their next rounds of products/services fall behind their competitors, leading to another round of reversal. 3. Dual-use and defense industries also differ in that they are the engines of national power. To be sure, certain traditional industries, such as steel, are important to national security. However, many traditional industries are largely commodities produced in many countries and are largely available as inputs. Advanced industries are different. Production is concentrated in relatively few countries. Advanced innovation/production ecosystems contribute to and support defense industries. And these industries enable national power to be projected and to defend against adversaries attempting to project their power. Losing aerospace, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, semiconductors, displays, advanced software, fiber optic cable, telecom equipment, machine tools, motors, measuring devices, and other dual-use sectors would give America’s adversaries incredible leverage. We have seen the importance of national power industries in history. Case in point, the relative weakness of Great Britain against Germany in both WWI and WWII. The advancement of Germany’s broad industrial base, and the atrophy of Britain’s, resulted in the latter’s relative military weakness, with only the entry of the United States in both wars enabling Britain to escape without military defeat. In his classic book The Collapse of British Power , Corelli Barnett wrote that: it was not the small size and partial decrepitude of Britain’s specialized armaments in industry that were mainly responsible for throttling back British armament. For specialized armament firms constitute only a small part of the production of modern war equipment, which is a matter of general industrial resources and technology, especially in all kinds of advanced engineering. It was such general and varied resources that Germany had been able to swiftly convert to producing munitions after 1933 but it was such a resources that Great Britain terribly lacked just as in 1914-15 as the Defence Policy and Requirements Committee had warned in submitting its recommendations for a large scale rearmament in February 1936: “The most serious factor in the completion of the proposed program is the limited output of our existing industrial resources. The key to successful completion of the service programs lie in the solution of the industrial problem. [123] Largely because of the dominant “liberal” “Adam Smithian” view of the role of government in industrial development, Britain never learned this lesson. After WWII, with the profligacy of the Beveridge-Attlee welfare state, the British once again “failed to retool the economy before European and Japanese competitors recovered from wartime devastation.” [124] For the British, the sad and stark reality is that it was too late for them to do anything meaningful with regard to power industries, even if the British political economy could enable needed action, which it could not. America is not Britain today, but it is Britian in the early 1960s: still a chance to retool but with time slipping by quickly and few political economy resources to take the painful and needed steps. Just as past wars provided the impetus for transformations in American techno-economic and trade regimes, it will be easier for American leaders and pundits to see that we are in a war after war starts. But if China bides its time for a least another decade or two, by then it will be too late, because the odds are Chinese firms will have begun to dominate most power industries. And importantly, once lost, it is virtually impossible to regain competitive position in most national power industries, especially ones that require global economies of scale. America is not Britain today, but it is Britian in the early 1960s: still a chance to retool but with time slipping by quickly and few political economy resources to take the painful and needed steps. The dominant view among most in Washington thinking about this challenge is to either 1) be largely unaware of barriers to entry, which would make it difficult if not virtually impossible in some industries for the United States to regain power industry capabilities once lost or 2) to believe that it doesn’t matter because the United States will just continue to innovate. The prevailing view about competitiveness in Washington is that innovation rains down from above for free, as MIT economist Robert Solow conceived of it, like manna from heaven. [125] It just is there for the taking. A slightly more sophisticated view is that it just requires a few favorable conditions such as risk-taking entrepreneurs, strong research universities, and venture capital. The fact that the United States is strong in innovation provides an ample intellectual crutch that prevents taking serious national power industry competition and loss. And so the thinking goes that, while it would be nice not to lose these old industries (old is usually defined as anything that was started 15 to 20 years ago), at the end of the day, America will prevail because we can play our innovation card. The Obama administration 2010 National Innovation Strategy summed up the prevailing view from both the Left and the Right: “Innovation—the process by which individuals and organizations generate new ideas and put them into practice—is the foundation of American economic growth and national competitiveness.” [126] And the key to that innovation is “Competitive markets provide strong incentives for private businesses to improve their products and operations and for capital and labor resources to be reinvested in our best ideas.” [127] If that is the case, we should welcome Chinese power industry predation because it ramps up the competitive pressures, providing even stronger pressures for U.S. companies to innovate. A recent article in Issues in Science and Technology , a magazine of the National Academies of Science, agrees: “We believe that American competitiveness … can be maximized by fostering breakthrough innovations.” [128] This is a bit like saying “small business drives growth”: both are aphorisms. Who can disagree with either? One appeal in the United States of an innovation strategy—or for some, an innovation culture—is that it avoids the dreaded “industrial policy” and picking winners. The market and plucky entrepreneurs in their garages will create the winners. The role of the government is to stay out of the way, provide them with foreign STEM workers, and keep capital gains taxes low. In an article by Tanner Greer, wherein he developed a typology of strategies on competing with China, he identified dynamists who focus on technology (rather than more broadly on industry) and who are skeptical or critical of state capacity: Dynamists are instead focused squarely on deregulating the American economy and reforming the American state. In their eyes, Chinese drone dominance is less a product of Chinese industrial policy than a result of the Federal Aviation Administration’s “war on technology;” America’s failure to match the stunning new infrastructure of China is best blamed on the National Environmental Policy Act regime; and cutting-edge developments in AI, crypto, and software engineering would have already transformed the American economy if not for the “regulatory capture, special interests, and perverse structural incentives” that have sheltered entrenched incumbents from real competition. [129] Dynamists live in a narrow world, believing that Silicon Valley is the “be all and end all” of technological innovation and that the government has played only a minor role in the Valley’s emergence as the world’s top technology hub. And for them solving the problem is pretty easy: just get rid of government barriers, such as on immigration, building restrictions, and narrow-minded government management of science. Then our heroic entrepreneurs can ride to the rescue and save us. Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google, wrote that the United States should spend less time focusing on limiting China. Instead, he wrote: “If the United States really wants to reindustrialize, it needs to double down on what it does best, including supporting scientific research, enacting immigration policies that welcome the best talent from abroad, and reducing regulatory hurdles.” [130] However, there are three key limitations to relying on innovation strategy, from more free market dynamists or more interventionist tech policy advocates, in ensuring U.S. national power industry strength. The first is, by definition, that an innovation strategy is agnostic with respect to power industries. We already see that where there is a growing concern that U.S. venture capital avoids so-called “deep tech,” also called “hard tech.” These are technologies that tend to be beyond software and the Internet, and require much more capital and engineering capabilities. Most power industries are hard tech. But they require more capital and have higher risks, so the market invests less than needed in them. Perhaps like rolling the dice, risk-taking entrepreneurs and profit-maximizing venture firms might invest in all the areas of power industries the nation needs, but the odds are a bit like rolling snake eyes six times in a row. Second, innovation is only the first step. Power comes from being able to produce and sell the innovation around the world. History is full of examples wherein the United State led on innovation only to have production go overseas, often to foreign companies. These include VHS technology, TVs, LCD displays, solar panels, robotic vacuum cleaners, EV batteries, CNC machine tools, robotics, digital cameras, high-speed rail, digital telecom equipment, LED lighting, carbon fiber, 3D-printing materials, MRI machines, and more. [131] To be sure, innovation is important; without it, American power industries would ultimately lose market share. But more innovation without domestic production does not boost national power. If anything, it gives power to China when Chinese companies enter production based on U.S. discoveries, which they all too often steal or otherwise purloin. Third, to the extent innovationists focus only on emerging tech, this misses the boat. Despite all the hype, America can’t fight and win wars with only superior AI. Moreover, as noted, power comes also from independence from China in key industries and products. Many of these are not cutting-edge technologies. History is full of examples wherein the United State led on innovation only to have production go overseas, often to foreign companies. Fourth, the idea that deregulation and a more supportive culture are enough to restore U.S. techno-economic power is an ideological fantasy. As discussed ahead, not losing the war will require significant state action, just as not losing U.S. semiconductor capability required public investment (tax and direct), not just an R&D program. Fifth, success relies in part on already having strong existing industries with an innovation ecosystem, which, if we lose, makes innovation harder. Innovation is not just something that happens. Put someone in the middle of nowhere and it’s unlikely you will get much innovation. Innovation is enabled by a rich ecosystem that includes existing companies. Indeed, many innovators used to work at large established companies and gained knowledge and connections that enabled them to innovate. The list is endless: Reid Hoffman left PayPal to start LinkedIn, Marc Benioff left Oracle to start Salesforce, Scott McNealy left IBM to cofound Sun Microsystems, Gordon Moore and Jerry Sanders left Fairchild Semiconductor to found Intel and AMD, respectively, and Jensen Huang left AMD/LSI Logic to cofound NVIDIA. It’s not just that existing companies are incubators for entrepreneurial founders; they also support what Shih and Pisano call the “industrial commons.” The industrial commons refers to the collective ecosystem of shared resources, infrastructure, specialized skills, and knowledge that enable a region’s manufacturing competitiveness and resilience. It encompasses the interconnected network of suppliers, researchers, skilled workers, and development capabilities that, when nurtured together, foster innovation and economic growth within a particular geographic area. As one article asserts, “A country does not rise to the level of its innovation. It falls to the level of its industrial commons.” [132] This is why former Intel CEO Andy Grove stated, perhaps in response to the preposterous claim by economist Alan Blinder that losing the U.S. television industry was a success: I disagree [that it’s a success to lose the “commodity” television industry]. Not only did we lose an untold number of jobs, we broke the chain of experience that is so important in technological evolution. As happened with batteries, abandoning today’s “commodity” manufacturing can lock you out of tomorrow’s emerging industry. [133] In other words, innovation without an advanced industrial commons becomes much harder, and the ability to scale any innovations that occur, even harder. Figure 4: Components of an industrial commons [134] As noted, foreign policy thinking is largely devoid of sophisticated analysis of industries, much less power industries. Conventional economics is only a bit better, but generally assumes that barriers to entry—difficulties for entrepreneurs or existing businesses to enter a competitor’s line of business—are generally small, and to the extent they are not, are a result of patents, government regulations, or unfair competition, the latter of which antitrust authorities must be ever vigilant against. Indeed, their ideal world is one of perfect competition, wherein entry barriers are zero. Prominent Austrian school (free market) economist Ludwig Von Mises spoke for many economists when he wrote, “The freedom to enter any business is essential to the preservation of the free enterprise.” [135] Milton Friedman agreed: “The greatest enemy of freedom has been concentrated power.” [136] And the neo-Brandeisians have the same view but for different reasons. Where the free-market conservatives envision an economy with no entry barriers because it enables freedom and maximizes “market forces,” the neo-Brandeisians want it because they hate capitalist profits. This is wrong even without considering China. As Joseph Schumpeter rightly argued, the barriers to entry that innovative firms often create are always temporary. This is why Schumpeter wrote, “Profit … is the premium put upon successful innovation in capitalist society and is temporary by nature: it will vanish in the subsequent process of competition and adaptation.” [137] In other words, if the best an entrepreneur could hope for was making back the cost of capital, there would be little innovation. After competitive failure of U.S. firms from Chinese aggression, the idea that the United States can easily get back in the market is fanciful. The reality is that there are many interconnected factors that can create significant barriers for companies attempting to enter advanced industries. But it is even more wrong when considering Chinese competition because it uses the massive power of the CCP to break down U.S. barriers of competition to not enable market forces to work, but rather to vanquish their business foes. For the purposes of the discussion here, that means that after competitive failure of U.S. firms from Chinese aggression, the idea that the United States can easily get back in the market is fanciful. In other words, if more American companies in power industries fail or are seriously weakened to the point where they are much smaller, it is likely that those losses will be permanent. Even if the USG woke up and on a bipartisan basis realized that the United States must rebuild that lost capacity, it would be extremely difficult and enormously expensive. That is why, as discussed ahead, it is so critical to slow the relative loss of power industries to China. Table 1, from a 1990 survey of U.S. firms, identifies multiple barriers to entry, with absolute cost advantages being the most important. Capital requirements are ranked second. In other words, some industries require large amounts of capital investment to enter. While economists may dismiss barriers to entry, firms take them deadly seriously because they are the core thing business leaders rightly work for. Table 1: Barriers to market entry ranked by U.S. firms in 1990 [138] Barriers Mean Std. Dev.

The most formidable obstacle is often the accelerated pace of technological advancement that occurs during a company’s absence. In advanced industries, knowledge compounds rapidly, and the technological gap can become insurmountable. Companies lose access to cutting-edge research, miss critical patent opportunities, and lose design capabilities—and their technical workforce disperses to competitors or just atrophies. The tacit knowledge embedded in organizational routines, process technology and layout, and employee expertise is particularly difficult to reconstruct. Reentry typically demands massive up-front investments in R&D, manufacturing capabilities, and infrastructure. Advanced industries often require specialized equipment, clean rooms, or complex supply chains that represent sunk costs with limited alternative uses. Financial markets may view reentry attempts skeptically, making capital more expensive or difficult to obtain. This is especially true in the United States where most markets want quick and certain returns. The company must also compete against established players with proven track records. During a company’s absence, market concentration may have increased, with remaining competitors strengthening their positions through consolidation, economies of scale, or network effects. This is particularly the case after Chinese firm market expansion. Established players often have preferential access to key suppliers, distribution channels, and talent pools. Moreover, customer relationships in B2B advanced industries are typically long term and trust based, making market penetration extremely challenging for returning entrants. In most cases, there are customer switching costs. Often the only way of entry is massive cost reductions or, if possible, a significant increase in the value proposition. Brand is another barrier to entry. If the competitor’s brand is strong, it’s hard to get into a market. To date, Chinese firms are generally not strong in brand, but that is changing. Advanced industries frequently involve complex regulatory environments that evolve continuously. Companies lose institutional knowledge about compliance requirements, relationships with regulatory bodies, and understanding of approval processes. New regulations may have emerged that create additional barriers, and the cost of achieving compliance from scratch can be prohibitive. This is especially the case when American companies try to reenter overseas markets. Specialized talent in advanced industries is often scarce and highly mobile. During the exit period, key personnel typically join competitors or leave the industry entirely. As we have seen with China, sometimes American talent actually goes and works for Chinese firms. If there are few firms in the United States with the demand for this specialized talent, the worker’s skills atrophy and are not used. Rebuilding teams requires not only recruiting individual experts but also reconstructing the collaborative knowledge networks and organizational capabilities that enable innovation and execution. Advanced industries often rely on complex ecosystems of specialized suppliers, research institutions, complementary service providers, and training institutions. These relationships take years to develop and may have become exclusive or capacity-constrained during the company’s absence. Reentry may require simultaneously rebuilding multiple interdependent relationships across the value chain. A factor that is given little attention, yet is important, is the barriers to entry when enough national power industries have lost market share or gone out of business, and therefore the pressure on government to adopt national power industry support policies. We can see that in a country such as Canada, which has deindustrialized so much and has so few advanced technology firms that the voices of high-end, knowledge-based firms that need strong government advanced industry policies are at best a whisper. Instead, companies that want cheap immigrant labor, banks and other financial services firms, and natural resource companies that want more rights to extract minerals and other materials dominate Canadian politics. To the extent advanced technology firms exist, they are dominated by small Canadian-owned firms that want handouts rather than a leg up. So, to the extent the Canadian government would put in place advanced industry techno-economic strategy, it would have to have capabilities for independent action that it does not now possess. The lobbying forces of other firms are just too strong. The United States is fortunate because it still has enough of a critical mass of large technology firms that press the USG to not put in place ill-advised anti-national power industry policies and to put in place favorable ones. But each weakening or death of an American national power industry firm with a Washington government-relations budget serves as one more barrier to reentry for the nation as whole. The United States is fortunate because it still has enough of a critical mass of large technology firms that press the USG to not put in place ill-advised anti-national power industry policies and to put in place favorable ones. Industries evolve through cycles of technological paradigms, and companies that exit during one paradigm may find the next cycle dominated by different technologies or business models. The timing of reentry attempts relative to industry cycles, product life cycles, and competitive dynamics can determine success or failure. The interaction between these factors creates what economists call “path dependency,” wherein a company’s current competitive position is heavily influenced by its historical choices and market evolution during its absence. This explains why even well-resourced companies with strong track records in other industries often struggle to successfully reenter advanced sectors in which they previously competed. Consumer welfare economics assumes that factor price adjustments lead to equilibrium. If a company loses market share, it cuts prices and regain it. But the reality, especially in capital- and research-intensive industries, is that market share loss can trigger a downward cumulative causation cycle. As figure 5 shows, less revenue can lead to less reinvestment in R&D which means that next-generation products either are not as goods as the competitors’ or enter the market late, in both cases reducing market share and sales even more. With fewer sales, capital investment budgets are cut, meaning that the company has a harder time investing in the most modern equipment, leading to slower productivity growth and reduced cost competitiveness, with other firms taking even more market share. And both factors lead to less innovation and less market share, with the downward cycle continuing to repeat unless the competitor firm makes a serious error or the core firm is able to discover a breakthrough innovation that lets it back in the game. Figure 5: The downward process Unlike most U.S. policymakers who either ignore barriers to entry or do everything possible to lower them to boost competition, even if it means that Chinese firms enter the U.S. market, most Chinese policymakers deeply understand techno-economic and trade factors and dynamics, including barriers to entry and how to overcome foreign barriers and then maintain their own. And that is why they work so hard to erect them, including promoting mergers, limiting foreign company access to Chinese markets, and providing subsidies so Chinese companies can attack foreign company margins with deep discounts below cost. At one level, it appears difficult for companies attempting to attack or disrupt established players in advanced industries. After all, these companies should have many of the barriers to entry previously described. But there are ways firms can successfully attack. And, as discussed, the CCP provides support for these attacks. Attacking companies should focus on periods when incumbents are most vulnerable, including during technological transitions, regulatory changes, and market disruptions. For example, when many U.S. companies were retrenching in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, and again during the 2020 COVID crisis, Chinese companies, backed by the CCP, kept up, and even accelerated their rate of investment. When markets came back to “normal,” they had gained market share at the expense of more prudent and market-driven Western companies. In the transition to 5G wireless, state-backed Huawei pushed hard to get into markets in developing nations, precluding Western companies from getting in, and thus setting themselves up for next generation sales. In the United States, companies such as Tesla succeeded by timing their entry during the EV transition when traditional automakers were slow to adapt. The CCP understood where the global market was going and not only subsidized its EV providers but also spurred EV demand through government policies (reduced taxes on EVs, better access to roads, etc.) This enabled the Chinese EV makers to sell massive numbers of vehicles in China and, as a result, gain scale economies and learning by doing. Western vehicle makers are rightly focused on current limited consumer demand for EVs, but now have been seriously disadvantaged in their efforts to move into the new EV markets. Only the Biden EV tariffs have prevented significant damage. China has done this in a range of other industries, including solar panels and drones, and is seeking a similar victory in industries such as robots, including humanoid robots. Most Chinese policymakers deeply understand techno-economic and trade factors and dynamics, including barriers to entry and how to overcome foreign barriers and then maintain their own. MIT business scholar Clay Christenssen argued that attackers seldom attack at the top, most profitable segments. Rather, they usually attack from the bottom on segments that are less profitable, less innovation based, and more likely to be given up by incumbents. Rather than launch frontal attacks on incumbents’ core markets, which incumbents are more likely to fight to defend, successful attackers often focus on neglected segments, emerging applications, or underserved customer needs. This allows them to establish footholds without triggering immediate competitive responses, while building capabilities and market presence. They then use these gains, coupled with the erosion of sales and profits from the incumbents to steadily move up in their attacks. China has done this in many markets, focusing on more commodity-like products (e.g., bulk chemicals, legacy chips, lower-end mobile phones, LCD displays, etc.). This combination of “good enough” products at a much more competitive price point is often a winning combination, especially in the non-OECD world where price is a more important factor. That not only weakens the rich country incumbents who sell in those markets, but also gives the Chinese firms revenues to move up the value chain. Huawei’s rise to global dominance in telecom equipment is a case study in that strategy. Companies competing against other companies in normal countries have more ability to attack than Western companies do against Chinese attackers. Most importantly is IP. Often, an attacker will use IP from the defender without their permission, and the attacker can win in court, thus significantly blunting the attack; and if they receive damages, weakening the attacker. But that is much more difficult against a Chinese attacker, at least in the Chinese market, because Chinese courts are an instrument of Chinese national power industry strategy and seldom side with the non-Chinese company. And even in the home U.S. market, that can be difficult, as winning a court case or obtaining a Section 337 exclusion order from the U.S. International Trade Commission against an unfair competing Chinese firm can be costly and difficult, especially as the law requires a showing of immediate market share loss. Defenders often can successfully defend against attacks through exclusive supplier agreements or strategic partnerships. But these are not possible in China. In fact, the CCP will weaponize them against foreign companies to limit their access to Chinese suppliers in order to favor their CCP champion attacker. The most important weapons CCP-backed attackers have are a protected market (in China and Belt and Road nations) and massive subsidies. Take CCP company COMAC, which is competing with Boeing and Airbus in the commercial aircraft market. There is a reason why, before COMAC, there were only two companies. The entry barriers were extremely high given the knowledge and capital requirements. But despite being a duopoly, the competition between Boeing and Airbus was intense, with each fighting intensively for big orders with airlines around the world. This was a market that, absent state intervention or some completely disruptive innovation (e.g., a hypersonic space plane), was going to stay a duopoly for the foreseeable future. No sane commercial company would seek to enter the market, because it would mean losing billions of dollars for at least a decade or more. But that did not stop China. China vaulted over those barriers by providing massive subsidies, enticing and threatening foreign parts and systems providers to sell COMAC what it needed, and then reserving the Chinese market for COMAC and subsidizing entry in Belt and Road countries. That is how a Chinese company overcomes big barriers to entry. If the United States and the West are to avoid losing the national power industry war, they will need to adopt the correct overall strategy. That will likely prove daunting, at least for now, because the vast majority of expert voices on foreign and economics relations with China support the wrong strategies. China overcomes barriers to market entry by subsidizing state-backed industrial champions such as COMAC If this dynamic plays out as it has in some other industries, the result will be a cumulative causation decline of Boeing and Airbus. They are likely to lose massive sales revenue in China and many of the less developed nations that China seeks to sell to with extremely generous export financing. And that means they will have less money to invest in next-generation aircraft. That in turn will reduce future sales, and the cycle will continue until perhaps only one of the two companies is left. We could see the same dynamic playing out in EVs, and even advanced industries such as memory chips and biopharmaceuticals. Given that China is not a normal competitor, the only away of defending against this kind of attack is with a trade wall in OECD nations against these attacks. Ideally, as we will discuss next year in a report on policy recommendations, this would mean long-term exclusion orders against the sales in OECD nations of unfairly competing Chinese companies. But import bans are only one tool. If the United States and the West overall are to avoid losing the national power industry war, they will need to adopt the correct overall strategy. That will likely prove daunting, at least for now, because the vast majority of expert voices on foreign and economic relations with China support the wrong strategies. America needs a coherent strategy to shape, guide, and implement policy choices. Victory in a kinetic war often goes to the side with the best overall strategy. Strategic choices need to be made. When and where to attack? When to retreat? When to outflank versus when to conduct a frontal assault? How to best combine and coordinate forces? And even when to leave the battlefield and form a redoubt? The techno-economic and trade war with China is no different. First and foremost, it requires an acknowledgment of the reality of the war and hence the need for a strategy. Some simply refuse to see that America (and its allies) are being attacked, denying the existence of national power industries, ignoring the CCP’s stated intentions and long litany of aggression, and turning a blind eye to U.S. power industry injury and even death. Others say “war” is an incendiary and provocative term and that the United States and China are only in competition or, at worst, perhaps in a narrow “trade war” over a few industries. Many even assert that we are allies in addressing global challenges. Some even say that it doesn’t matter. After all, countries don’t compete. Or China is just trying to catch up. Or we benefit from trading with China. Or we need to engage with China. Etc. But we are in a techno-economic and trade war, and it does matter. Indeed, there is a potential tidal wave of value destruction headed at U.S. national power industries, as better funded and more financially patient Chinese competitors keep up their relentless global expansion. PRC champions are coming after Western firms in national power industries, and they will not stop. Indeed, the PRC’s is a scorched earth campaign, leaving no survivors, always maintaining the assault. And firms in U.S. and allied national power industries (including Europe) have nowhere to hide from this techno-economic blitzkrieg unless governments take action based on a coherent strategy. Overall, the issue of China is largely framed by international relations scholars and experts, not business and industrial strategy experts. The former are aware of such competition, but they largely see it as subservient to overall foreign policy considerations and goals. Moreover, few understand the operation of advanced industries, the nature of the competition and the importance of barriers to entry and reentry. As such, the prevailing narratives largely ignore the strategic threats that techno-economic and trade wars pose for U.S. power. When it comes to China, U.S. experts and pundits advance a number of strategic choices. Some put good relations with China above all other considerations. Some are based on a denial of the conflict. Others accept the conflict, but don’t see the need for a new strategy. Others are guided by Ricardian free trade theory with its overarching belief in trade as always being win-win. Many, including trade and foreign policy experts, are globalists in the sense that the world should be one with few or no trade barriers and open and sustained cooperation between nations—and if the allies continue to work with China, that world will emerge. There is a potential tidal wave of value destruction headed at U.S. national power industries, as better funded and more financially patient Chinese competitors keep up their relentless global expansion. Others hold an explicit or implicit derision of the United States, seeing it as a white, imperial nation, motivated by capitalist greed. Therefore, the United States should be dethroned as the global hegemon. And many who specialize in studying China get “captured” by China, seeing the world, at least partially, through its eyes. And due to the fact that the CCP rewards and punishes U.S. Chinese studies scholars based on whether it likes their views, many U.S. scholars trim their sails. Yet, collectively, these experts articulate a range of views and opinions that influence preferred strategic choice. As such, these choices need to be analyzed and assessed. For the sake of clarity, I provide analogies and titles reflective of strategic choices made in past wars, including WWII and in the conflict with the Soviet Union and how current strategic choices mirror those. Many of these proposed strategic approaches are offered by engagers, those policy experts and scholars who put engagement with China above all else. For them, nothing should get in the way of engagement. As such, they exaggerate and stress the supposed panoply of benefits from being solicitous to the CCP, and dismiss and downplay the actions the CCP takes that are against U.S. interests. The problem is that the days of engagement are, if they were ever legitimate to begin with, gone. Yet, engagers persist in out-of-date, flawed strategic framing. China scholar David Schambaugh has said about the engagers that “these were individuals who had spent their entire professional careers working to engage China. Now their life’s work was under attack, and many individuals were naturally defensive.” [139] There are several flavors of engagement. There is no question that the United State gave too much aid to the Soviet Union during WWII, enabling them to gain more ground in the West and emerge stronger after the war with Germany to become a global adversary with America. FDR was oblivious to the threat from Stalin and even saw “Uncle Joe” as someone he could work it. Today, one China strategy is to simply assume that there is no conflict, and that the opposite is even true: a strong China is good for the world. One article lists the cases for de-escalation and engagement: China accounts for global GDP growth. China drives global economic growth, so a sound bilateral relationship is important to American consumers and workers, as well as to families who are counting on stock market returns to pay for their retirement. In the 10 years through 2019, China, on average, accounted for about one third of global economic growth, larger than thecombinedshare. [140] Likewise, the U.S. China Business Council) has written, “ Today, the US-China trade relationship actually supports roughly 2.6 million jobs in the United States across a range of industries .” [141] Parroting the standard fare, an article in Foreign Affairs entitled “The Overreach of the China Hawks: Aggression Is the Wrong Response to Beijing” argues, “Closer ties with Beijing have led to Chinese acceptance of international rules in areas such as nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, arms control, and some aspects of global trade and finance. Engagement also brought China into the global economy and fueled economic growth worldwide.” [142] These comments about China fueling growth demonstrates the engagers’ ignorance of both domestic and international economics. They assume China boosted global growth because China imported some goods. But China consistently ran a trade surplus. The net effect on GDP in the rest of the world was negative, not positive, as GDP is lowered when X-M (exports minus imports) is negative. So yes, exports to China supports jobs in the United States, but imports to the United States from China take away jobs from the United States, and since the United States runs a massive trade deficit with China, the U.S. production economy has been weakened, even though consumers save a few bucks. Moreover, this framing reflects stale Keynesian demand-side thinking, suggesting that demand from China, rather than lower interest rates from the Fed, keeps the U.S. economy at full employment. U.S. full employment is not dependent in any way shape or form on what China does. Domestic demand should always equal domestic supply, and when it doesn’t, domestic monetary and fiscal policy help restore the balance. The reality is rather than the CCP helping global growth, it weakened it. The CCP’s price suppression of wages and other business costs at home led to reduced productivity worldwide, as rather than invest in automation at home, companies in high-wage economies moved production to low-wage, less automated China, lowering global growth. And as China unfairly dominated manufacturing, the opportunities to move up the value chain for developing economies shrank to nothing. And finally, as ITIF has shown, China’s unfair “innovation mercantilist strategies have lowered global innovation as less innovative Chinese firms unfairly took market share from more innovative Western firms. [143] The reality is that U. S. growth does not depend on Chinese growth or any other foreign economy growth; in the moderate term, it depends on U.S. domestic productivity growth and nothing else. Related to this is the foreign policy and international economy consensus that praises China for raising tens of millions out of poverty. An article by leading China experts in Foreign Affairs entitled “T he Overreach of the China Hawks: Aggression Is the Wrong Response to Beijing” argues, “It is true, as [Aaron] Friedberg asserts, that China’s leaders seek to harness economic growth to boost the nation’s international stature and power. But Friedberg insists that this goal overrides all other purposes, ignoring the very real ways in which growth has benefited huge numbers of Chinese citizens.” [144] This is truly a striking statement, echoing fellow traveler statements in the 1930s and 1940s, arguing that sure, while Stalin had show trials, purges, and gulags, at least he boosted growth. Since when does the welfare of an adversary’s citizens become of paramount concern for U.S. foreign policy? [145] What is even more striking is that if there is one thing China’s techno-economic strategy has not done is benefit huge numbers of Chinese citizens. The CCP’s entire strategy has been to immiserate the proletariat to invest in weapons—a massive military and massively subsidized national power industries. If you want to look at a Chinese territory that benefited its citizens over the same period of time, look at Taiwan. After the revolutionary overthrow of the legitimate Kuomintang government by the CCP in 1949, China and Taiwan had about the same GDP per capita. Today, Taiwan’s is almost three times greater. [146] One way to avoid having to deal with adversaries is to define them as allies, either by formal agreements, informal collaboration, or simply assuming a lack of adversariness. Stalin was so desperate to avoid war with Hitler that he blindly signed the Molotov/Ribbentrop Pact, hoping that Hitler would turn west instead of east and the capitalist powers would exhaust themselves, allowing Stalin to move in and conquer Western territory. But if Stalin had only read Mein Kampf , he would have realized that Hitler’s overarching goal was not to fight the West but to stamp out communism. Today, many U.S. foreign policy experts believe that the United States and China are allies in ensuring a safe and secure world. Indeed, this has been the default view of the U.S. foreign policy establishment for decades. A 1994 report by the Trilateral Commission argued that “China should be regarded more as an opportunity than a threat” and that the United States should seek to “incorporate China in the emerging world order.” [147] This view has changed little over time, as we see in a 2019 in an open letter in The Washington Post complaining about Trump’s more assertive policy toward China. Among seven key points made by over 100 prominent U.S. foreign policy scholars, including friends of China Stapleton Roy and Susan Thorton, was, “We do not believe Beijing is an economic enemy or an existential national security threat that must be confronted in every sphere.” [148] It goes on to state, “The fear that Beijing will replace the United States as the global leader is exaggerated.” I wonder if six years later any of the 100 signers would like to take back this last statement. Along a similar vein, leading China scholars Jude Blanchette and Ryan Hass have written: Instead of these two great nations pooling their considerable economic resources and human talent to jointly address the world’s many growing challenges, they lock horns in a multifaceted strategic competition. The blunt reality is that because of these deep divisions, there will be diseases that will not be cured, there will be children who will unnecessarily suffer, and our climate will continue to degrade as opportunities for global cooperation slip through humanity’s fingers. The mutual mistrust and strategic rivalry between the United States and China create barriers to innovation, collaboration, and the bold, unified action needed to tackle existential threats. In this fractured global landscape, the pursuit of dominance and security overshadows the shared responsibility to steward a livable future for all, leaving the world worse off. [149] They continued: Collaboration with China is essential to addressing climate change. And even amid trade wars and derisking, China remains an important economic and trading partner with the United States. Scientists of the two countries have collaborated with each other on important and meaningful basic research projects that benefit not only the two countries but all of humankind. One area of fruitful research is in agriculture… The common view is that the United States and China need to cooperate to address climate change, global terrorism, infectious diseases, and other global challenges. [150] Today, many U.S. foreign policy experts believe that the United States and China are allies in ensuring a safe and secure world. Those who assert that the United States and China are adversaries or even in competition with China are routinely excoriated by the cooperation camp. We see this in a vitriolic attack on a leading scholar in the China competition camp, Princeton University scholar Aaron Freidberg. A group of engagers wrote in Foreign Affairs —the journal of the engagers—that “Friedberg calls not for mere competition but for an antagonistic rivalry that minimizes any attempt at cooperation.” [151] They even wrote, “A pragmatic policy would recognize the value of economic ties with China and encourage continued Sino-U.S. cooperation in many critical areas, including technology.” [152] How exactly do they explain how Chinese technology and trade policy has helped the United States on net? They simply waive their hands and assert it. In other words, for this still powerful camp, cooperation is the paramount goal, and responding to Chinese aggression gets in the way by irritating our interlocutors. They are certainly right about the last part: yes, if the USG presses China on issues of true national concern and even survival, cooperation will be much harder. But if the USG does not, U.S. global leadership will be threatened. There are at least two major problems with the engagement camp. First, they are so focused on engagement for engagement’s sake that they come up with a seemingly endless litany of things we must engage on. Anything to keep engagement going. But presumably these issues are important to both the United States and China. In this case, why is the CCP not the supplicant to the USG, coming to Washington to ask the United States if it will cooperate with China and giving the United States concessions for doing so. Because only U.S. experts and pundits are this naïve. There is little evidence that the CCP sees things this way. It is happy to talk about win-win relations, but we should not take them at their word. The CCP uses the desire for cooperation to advance its own specific techno-economic predatory practices. CCP officials are happy to say they will cooperate on climate change as long as the United States does not press China on an issues such as IP theft. And in the past, the United States has naïvely taken that deal, believing it has gotten the best of it. Second, reflecting Stalin’s naïveté and desperation with Hitler, many U.S. officials and pundits assume that China will help America shoulder the heavy responsibility for global order, including open and fair trade. Nothing is further from the truth. The CCP does not want co-responsibility for global order; it wants sole responsibility so it can impose its version of global order. And when it comes to trade, China’s vision harkens back to British trade policy in the 1700s and 1800s, wherein Britain exported manufacturing goods to its empire and imported underpriced commodities. Given China’s history and current practice of massive mercantilism, the idea that anyone could actually respond to these claims with a straight face is truly astounding. Most importantly, engagement always comes at a price. The CCP and its leadership are realists, caring only about the CCP’s Marxist-Leninist interests. When CCP officials see the USG asking it for help for addressing a global problem, they always exact a price. If this litany of cooperation is of no real interest to China, then why are we pushing for them, when most of the issues are either related to global concerns (and why are these our concerns if addressing them comes at a cost to America?) or can be dealt with by the United States alone? A core reason, of course, is because so much of the U.S. foreign policy community puts governing the world ahead of advancing U.S. interests, especially techno-economic capabilities and strengths, something the engagers show absolutely no interest in. Most importantly, engagement always comes at a price. The CCP and its leadership are realists, caring only about the CCP’s Marxist-Leninist interests. When CCP officials see the USG asking it for help for addressing a global problem, they always exact a price. Sure, we will help you, but only if you have to back off key issues, especially our predatory trade, tech, and economic actions that are hurting your national power industry firms. It would be one thing if the factors the USG were being supplicants for truly mattered and could be addressed by “cooperation.” But the issues either don’t or can’t. Just look at the list of issues the USG constantly trots out as important to cooperate on. After the San Francisco summit of 2023 with Biden and Xi, the USG statement said that: the deliverables included more cooperation on artificial intelligence, a working group to promote tourism, cooperation in counter-narcotics, and combatting fentanyl trafficking, enhanced cooperation on climate change, an increase in airline flights, and people to people exchanges. [153] Later, National Security Council head Jake Sullivan said, “We are ready to coordinate on climate, health security, macroeconomic stability, and … risks posed by AI.” [154] Given that the Chinese cannot be negotiated with on issues of real concern, especially techno-economic and trade ones, rather than walk away and say that nothing was accomplished, the administration put on a happy face with these “important” issues of cooperation. No one ever asks, “Why do we need to cooperate on these?” They are seen as self-obvious. But they should be questioned, as they are either not needed, not important, or something countries can do on their own. Let’s look at each one: ▪ Artificial Intelligence. What for? The United States does not need to worry about any AI use in our country because Congress could enact a regulatory regime to govern AI if needed. We don’t worry about unsafe drugs from other nations because we have Federal Drug Administration drug approvals. AI is no different. Ahh, but what about the killer Terminator AI? What about it? It is science fiction, not reality. Even if it were reality, it’s in the CCP’s interest not to get terminated by AI too. We don’t need to cooperate. What about AI weapons? Does anyone really believe that America should limit its battlefield use on the basis of an agreement signed with the CCP? If you do, I have a bridge to sell you. ▪ Tourism promotion. Surely, they must be kidding. Who cares? And why would the United States want more Chinese tourists, and why do we need to cooperate with the CCP on it in anyway? ▪ Airline flights. Again, what? If we want more airline flights from China, the Federal Aviation Administration and U.S. airports can make that happen. And if the CCP wants more U.S. flights, it can do the same. ▪ People-to-people exchanges. See above re: airline flights. ▪ Cooperation in counter-narcotics. Is this not something the CCP is very interested in? If so, they can ask us for help. ▪ Combatting fentanyl trafficking. Okay, this is another one of “you must be kidding.” The CCP could stop the flow of fentanyl and precursors to the United States next week, but it chooses not to because they know it weakens America and strengthens China. ▪ Health security. Let me get this right. It is likely that a CCP lab created (with financial help from America’s National Institutes of Health) and inadvertently let loose the COVID-19 virus on the world and then proceeded to cover it up and manipulated the World Health Organization to do its bidding. We should cooperate with a government that did that? [155] This is something out of Orwell. ▪ Macroeconomic stability. With China having a long-running a massive trade surplus with the world while intentionally trying to deindustrialize the world, we should ask their help with macroeconomic stability? Wow. And again, presumably China has an interest in macroeconomic stability in the face of a global financial collapse or massive recession. So why are we the ones asking for it? ▪ And of course, wait for it… climate change. The big kahuna. But isn’t China concerned about climate change too? It is more vulnerable to climate change than the United States is given the larger share of its population at sea level and its lower per capita income. Why does the CCP not beg the United States to do more? Why should we implore them? And the reality is that climate change will never be solved until we get clean energy technology that costs the same or less as dirty. No amount of “cooperation” will help. The reality is that the CCP will keep increasing its emissions of greenhouse gases until it makes economic sense for it to stop. To be sure, it is important not to unilaterally cut off diplomatic ties with China. But the idea that we need China to help us on certain matters and that this means not pressing them harder for their techno-economic aggression against U.S. (and allied) companies and the U.S. economy is just the ultimate in naïveté. The reality is that we are long past the time when the USG could influence China policy in any meaningful way. The first Obama administration was the last time that was possible. Their power is just too great now. Let’s top being a supplicant and get on with defending our economy from Chinese techno-economic aggression. A good example of this view is from the Peterson Institute for International Relations. Ha Jiming (a scholar in China) and Adam Posen wrote: We all believe that China-U.S. trade has been clearly win-win, and will continue to be so if it is conducted by the rules of that order, and if those rules are consensually adapted to economic change. In fact, given the degree to which China has developed, the two economies have more fundamental economic interests in common now than before, including in safeguarding and abiding by that system. [156] They view the competition as normal and healthy, writing, “Chinese companies have a right to compete with U.S. companies and succeed in any sector, including in high-tech.” [157] They went on to state: While much has been made of Made in China 2025 and the earlier “indigenous innovation” programs, the Chinese government’s aspirations to make China a technological leader in some fields should not be considered a threat to the United States. Even some government subsidization of relevant R&D or technical education in this pursuit should not be inherently contentious. [158] In other words, in this view, global trade is always win-win, value maximizing, and pointing out that China is not a Ricardian trader but a power trader intent on dominance is simply “not cricket.” Peterson’s commitment to global integration and free trade is so blinding and all-encompassing that it simply cannot admit that China is not playing by global welfare-maximizing rules. No worry, it will all work out; the natural global division of labor will prevail. Likewise, Ryan Hass at the Brookings Institution wants the United States not to be overly harsh with China, including on techno-economic issues, so that we can work cooperatively on global challenges such as global warming. [159] As part of his naïveté toward communist regimes, including the CCP, George Marshall proposed the “Marshall Plan: to extend aid to the Soviets in part to bring them closer to the United States.” [160] Stalin clearly had no interest in taking our money or becoming closer. Likewise, the United States has long supported aid to China to keep them engaged. As Shambaugh wrote, the Carter administration saw that “science and tech was the perfect medium to keep the Chinese engaged given Beijing’s own prioritization on modernization.” [161] Carter’s agreement stated, “Affirming that such cooperation can strengthen friendly relations between both countries.” [162] In 2006, the State Department wrote of the agreement, “The S&T Agreement has withstood the test of political turmoil and has provided a stabilizing influence on U.S.— Sino relations.” [163] According to the Congressional Research Service, U.S. AID and the State Department provided over $417 million in aid to China between 2001 and 2017. [164] The U.S.-supported World Bank still provides funding to China. [165] Even the Department of War provides funding to Chinese research universities. [166] In other words, helping Ch ina grow its national power industries by sharing U.S. science and technology is good because it keeps the CCP favorable toward America. Clearly, this did not stop China from engaging in massive IP theft and forced technology transfer against U.S. companies. The foreign policy Left loves to advance the narrative that it was Harry Truman’s hawkishness, not FDR’s coddling of “Uncle Joe” Stalin, that caused the Cold War. Stalin just wanted to be left alone. Of course, this framing is ideological nonsense. Stalin was always the aggressor, and all Truman did was help America wake up to it. Today, this narrative is applied to the United States and China. If only the United States, and in particular China hawks, would just stop pressing China, CCP leaders would become more reasonable. As early as 1998, a review of Peter Rodman’s book Between Friendship and Rivalry: China and America in the 21st Century (Rodman was deputy national security advisor in the Reagan administration) stated that there is a “drift toward strategic rivalry between China and the United States, but that it can be slowed or reversed if the two sides find common ground on such strategic issues as Korea, Pakistan, regional stability, and the Asian economic crisis.” [167] In other words, if we don’t cooperate with China, they will try to become our rival. [168] Foreign policy professor Charles Glaser agrees, writing that “China’s Rise Can Be Peaceful If the U.S. Doesn’t Provoke It.” [169] As David Shambaugh wrote, this camp argues that “it was not China’s fault or actions that had caused the relationship to deteriorate so precipitously, it was America’s fault!” [170] Some go even harder on this blame game. A report for the Quincy Institute, an organization that emphasizes military restraint and diplomatic engagement and cooperation, states: An alternative China policy would foreground internationalism, global cooperation, and multilateral efforts against climate change, public health dangers, and global inequality. Such an approach would not only reduce bilateral tensions, it would also confront the root causes of great power conflict and the rise of illiberal politics in China, the United States, and around the world. [171] If we just got rid of capitalism, the CCP would like us more. I am sure it would. When Labour, Liberal, and Conservative parties in Britain in the 1930s started to wake up to the threat from German National Socialism, certain segments of British society were sympathetic to Hitler, especially Oswald Mosley’s “black shirt” movement. Today, while not as explicit or perhaps extreme, there are some whose strategy is that the United States should do everything possible to get close to China, downplaying its Marxist-Leninist nature and seeking friendship. The leading organization with this view is the National Committee on U.S. China Relations (NCUSR). It has written, worryingly, that “more than three-quarters of Americans hold an unfavorable view of China.” [172] Rather than accept that Americans may be onto something (e.g., Uyghur oppression, lack of Chinese citizen freedom, closed U.S. factories, aggression toward Taiwan, etc.) NCUSR’s “Public Intellectuals Program is trying to change that.” [173] In other words, it would like to see these three-quarters of Americans hold a favorable view of China. And as such, its strategy is to do everything to keep relations strong. NCUSR tells us that China has a massive military not because of external aggression, but because it needs to control tensions at home. [174] It tells us that China is not the only one that sees U.S. global leadership as problematic, and China needs to have much greater say in shaping global affairs. [175] The progressive Left, with its global-proletariat and anti-U.S. views, also embraces this perspective. For many of them, having China replace the United States as the global hegemon would be a welcome relief. Another is “The Committee of 100,” a group of Chinese Americans chaired by former ambassador to China Gary Locke. The group objects to policies limiting China. For example, it opposes legislation limiting Chinese nationals’ ability to buy U.S. farmland. [176] It argues that investigations and prosecutions of Chinese spies and IP thieves were racial profiling, even though it is clear that the CCP is massively supportive of IP theft in the United States, and there were no investigations of other Asian nationalities. [177] The progressive Left, with its global-proletariat and anti-U.S. views, also embraces this perspective. For many of them, having China replace the United States as the global hegemon would be a welcome relief. Even CCP fellow travelers such as Columbia’s Jeffrey Sachs are in this camp. [178] Sachs, a “useful idiot” to the CCP, publishes articles in the state-run journal China Daily about U.S. decline and the problems with U.S. hegemony and how China needs to become a global leader. [179] Sachs actually appears on Chinese TV news shows urging China and other countries to cooperate to resist the United States. [180] His message: Trump is a bad nationalist; Xi is a wonderful globalist. [181] And he believes that China is the economic model for much of the rest of the world, especially developing nations, despite the fact that Chinese industrialization has meant the stagnation of industrial development in other developing nations. [182] He straight up argues that the U.S. should not be the leader of the world. And he has told the CCP’s Global Times that he “regrets U.S. foreign policy toward China.” [183] Jeff, perhaps you should instead teach in China? Another flavor of this capitulation is that, in large part because of severe structural disfunctions in the United States, mostly due to Trump, China will overtake us as the global hegemon. But that’s okay because the world needs someone to lead. Better China than a post-hegemonic world of chaos. C. Fred Bergsten, former head of the Peterson Institute, exemplified this view in his 2022 book The United States vs. China: The Quest for Global Economic Leadership . [184] Bergsten is the dean emeritus of the U.S. foreign economic policy community, especially when it comes to global economic issues. And this book reflects that community’s bias. He wrote about China seeking global leadership, which he views as simply tough competition, not a zero-sum battle to win the war for national power industries. In fact, the book is largely sympathetic and optimistic toward China. In Bergsten’s conception, someone needs to lead the world order, and if it can’t be the United States, China should step up. He (wrongly) sees China as “the largest engine of growth for the world economy,” (see above) and (wrongly) says that Chinese cooperation with the U.S. is critical to solving key global challenges (see above). [185] And rather than discuss China’s predatory policies, he wrote (wrongly) that “China is now emphasizing domestic rather than international drivers of growth” (written just before China doubled its global trade surplus). In fact, the CCP has been trotting out the promise of rebalancing to domestic consumption for over 15 years and American policymakers still believe them—like Charlie Brown believes Lucy will really hold the football this time. And amazingly, he blames both China and the United States for the problems from COVID‑19. He then wrote that once China catches up to the United States, it will become a responsible stakeholder and stop “cheating.” (This is remarkably similar to what the advocates of China’s WTO accession said in the late 1990s). He touts China’s global economic leadership record, admitting that, sure, they have a few problems with mercantilism, but he is convinced that they will outgrow them once they catch up. But of course, that is like saying that once Stalin conquered most of the world, he would give up on his military aggression. By the time China becomes “responsible,” it will have won the war. If the CCP truly wants to help with global governance, it can start by dismantling its mercantilist techno-economic war machine and compete on the same basis other nations do. Bergsten then gets to the key point: the CCP’s main and overarching priority is to stay in power, not to dominate the world. And of course, he reminds us, don’t forget the power of the Western-oriented liberal reformers in the CCP. Thus, his conclusion is that the United States should assist China in elevating itself on the global stage and in more global institutions so that China can help us solve the world’s problems. The Carnegie Endowment agrees, writing in a volume on U.S.-China relations that “the United States and China have a joint interest in finding a modus vivendi that provides the context for continued peace, prosperity, and national flourishing.” [186] If the CCP truly wants to help with global governance, it can start by dismantling its mercantilist techno-economic war machine and compete on the same basis other nations do. Many of the preferred strategic choices come from those who are so convinced of America’s superiority and China’s structural flaws that there is nothing to worry about. These strategies council patience and no need for fundamental U.S. policy change. After President Truman and others sounded the alarm on the Soviets’ global ambitions, few if any could ignore the Soviet Challenge. George Kenan, the architect of Soviet containment, argued that the Soviet Union would naturally self-destruct and counseled containment. And he was right about the outcome. But it took more than 40 years for that to happen, and the United States emerged victorious and dominant. Today, one thing both Xi and Trump have done is to make it harder to ignore that China is a pacing competitor to the United States. And so, some U.S. China scholars and pundits feel that they cannot ignore that China challenge. But for those who finally now, albeit grudgingly, see China as a competitor, the preferred strategy is to Kennan-like wait for China to naturally decline. The idea is that just as with the Soviet Union, eventually, because of a raft of internal contradictions, the Chinese economy, and perhaps even the CCP, will self-destruct, and then China will no longer be a threat. Let’s just contain China and all will be well. The problem, as discussed ahead, is that even with the Soviet union’s rampant spying and IP theft from the West, it has never had the capability to structurally weaken America’s power industries. China does and will likely win well before it—if it even does—becomes a democracy. In 1998, right before China’s growth accelerated even more, economist Nick Lardy wrote a book about China’s unfinished revolution and argued, “ Those who magnify the ‘China threat’ by extrapolating from China’s past growth rates are seriously mistaken.” [187] Indeed, they were mistaken because, in contrast to Lardy’s pessimism, China grew even faster in the 2000s. But for neoclassical trade economists, there is no way a state-controlled economy can grow consistently. Not only that, but Lardy argued that continued growth depends on the CCP to surrender a great deal of economic and political power because, as we all know, state-directed capitalism is a failure. It is the strong desire to avoid facing the bracing reality that the United States has never in its history faced such a serious geopolitical threat that makes this kind of “wait for Chinese decline” so appealing. He then advocated that the United States needed to assist in China’s enterprise and bank restructuring program. Here he was right, because if China had followed Lardy’s neoclassical advice and its banks had focused on only making money rather than on fueling China’s national power industries, China would not be the techno-economic power it is today. More recently, John Mueller, a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute wrote, “The lesson of the Cold War is not about the value of persistent containment in breaking your adversary’s will and sapping its power. It is about the wisdom of standing back, keeping your cool, and letting the contradictions in your opponent’s system become apparent.” [188] In other words, for free-market ideologues, the Chinese economy must self-destruct because it violates the free-market creed. In addition, it is the strong desire to avoid facing the bracing reality that the United States has never in its history faced such a serious geopolitical threat that makes this kind of “wait for Chinese decline” so appealing. No need for the intellectually and emotionally difficult desire to reassess long held and deeply committed to ideas and doctrines. No need to question whether the current American techno-economic and trade system will suffice to respond effectively to the challenge. No need to retool one’s intellectual framework to adjust to new realities. This is why any and all bits of bad news out of China are leaped on by so many as evidence of China’s impending doom. China has too much internal competition. [189] Chinese firms have low profits. China has a housing bubble. China has a demographic challenge. [190] Chinese millionaires are fleeing. In 2021, The New York Times published an opinion piece entitled “How Will We Win the Second Cold War?” arguing that we will win by doing nothing and letting China self-destruct. [191] The article pointed to “the inner weakness that the regime can’t get rid of because it’s part of its DNA.” Ahh, that is comforting. We can continue our ways, and the problem will take care of itself. A Project Syndicate article agreed: “No matter what China does, its economy’s momentum will be sapped by an aging, shrinking labor force, past overdrafts of public spending, and weak consumption. While the country is often now compared to Japan three decades ago, its outlook is actually much bleaker.” [192] But to blindly assert that China will collapse because it has a broken economic model (i.e., not America’s) is the height of hubris and wish fulfillment. As the author of the Atlantic Council report “The Longer Telegram” wrote, China is: more dexterous in survival than its Soviet counterpart, aided by the fact that China has studied carefully, over more than a decade, “what went wrong” in the Soviet Union. It would therefore be extremely hazardous for US strategists to accept that an effective future US China strategy should rest on an assumption that the Chinese system is destined to inevitably collapse from within. [193] A bit like die-hard Marxists in the 1980s and 1990s still holding onto the view that capitalism must collapse of its own weight and internal contradictions, these China critics just counsel patience. Don’t worry, the collapse is coming. There is little evidence that if the “reformers” gained power they would not continue their practice of power economics and goal of dominating national power industries. Some alternative history advocates have explored what would have happened if the United Kingdom had supported the assassination of Hitler, surmising that the Nazi replacement leader would not have been as militarily aggressive. Today, related to the view that China is on autopilot to self-destruct is the view that it is Xi Jinping that is the problem and when he leaves power, China will go back to normal cooperation. They assert that things were workable before him and when he and those in his camp lose power, as they surely must, conflict will significantly lesson. Perhaps the best example of this is from “The Longer Telegram” report, wherein the author wrote that: the central focus of an effective US and allied China strategy must be directed at the internal fault lines of domestic Chinese politics in general and concerning Xi’s leadership in particular. A fundamental error of US strategy has been to attack China as a whole, thereby enabling Xi’s leadership to circle the wagons within Chinese politics around the emotional pull of Chinese nationalism and civilizational pride. Just as significant an error has been to crudely attack the Chinese Communist Party itself. However, the political reality is that the party is divided on Xi’s leadership where he threatens the lives, careers, and deeply held policy positions of many within its senior political echelons. [194] He went on to write that “all US political and policy responses to China’s current strategy should be focused through the single lens of Xi himself.” [195] The 2019 Open Letter authors agree, stating,: “Efforts to isolate China will simply weaken those Chinese intent on developing a more humane and tolerant society.” [196] They went on to write, “The United States should encourage Chinese participation in new or modified global regimes in which rising powers have a greater voice.” [197] In other words, let’s not rock the boat and the “anti-Xi’s” will emerge and we can get back to friendly, win-win relations. Whether CCP reformers can gain power is beyond the scope of this report. Given Xi’s Marxist-Leninist extremism, it certainly couldn’t hurt. But to assume that the problem is Xi and not the inherent logic and goals of the CCP expressed since its very formation is to naïvely misinterpret China’s long-term goals. Deng Xiaoping had the same goals as Xi; he just knew that he had to bide his time and hide his light. There is little evidence that if the “reformers” gained power they would not continue their practice of power economics and goal of dominating national power industries. They might do it in more subtle and less aggressive ways because they would believe that it was a better way to achieve their goal, but domination would still be their goal. There is a related strategy that some hold on to and that is to wait until the CCP is finally replaced. Perhaps this is possible if enough Chinese become truly middle class and the then current generation can’t remember China’s abject poverty. However, unlike Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, which shifted to democracy when they got to a certain level of development, the United States is not directly influencing and pressing China to open up and become democratic. And the CCP appears to want to hold on to power vastly more than Asian Tiger autocrats did. More fundamentally, assuming that China eventually follows the democratic path of other Asian Tigers, by then the techno-economic war will long be over, with the United States and the West having lost much of their national power industry base. A vast techno-industrial destruction would be left in the wake. Unchecked, China could very well take over the global semiconductor industry, the chemical industry, AI, electronics, robotics, aerospace, biopharmaceuticals, precision instruments, and more. Chamberlin’s deal with Hitler was premised on the notion that Hitler only wanted to reunite former German territory. That may have been right in the West; it definitely was not in the East, as anyone who had read Mein Kampf would have understood. Today, there is a similar strategic response, especially from European policymakers. Many in the EU believe that the CCP has no desire for global strategic industry dominance; it simply wants its own strategic industries, just like Europe wants to not be dependent on Trump’s America. The EU Parliament has written that China’s “drive for ‘self-reliance’ in strategic sectors aims to lessen dependence on foreign technology, bolstering resilience and reducing vulnerability.” [198] The problem with this view is twofold. First, China is achieving that by closing its markets to foreign companies, something Europe is not willing to do in response to China’s mercantilism because it still believes in the vision of the WTO. Second, and more importantly, the CCP wants domination, not just self-reliance. Self-reliance lessens its dependency on adversaries. Domination gives it leverage over adversaries. The CCP’s entire Belt and Road and “going out” strategies are premised on attack and conquer, not just industrial defense of its homeland. Many in the EU believe that the CCP has no desire for global strategic industry dominance; it simply wants its own strategic industries, just like Europe wants to not be dependent on Trump’s America. Before World War II, the French military high command and political leadership assumed that its forces were superior to Germany’s. It had more men under arms, its tanks were considered superior, and it had the Maginot Line. This led both the civilian and military leadership to become overconfident, failing to spend money to rearm. At the same time, it led the French military to become complacent in strategy, planning to fight a long, protracted war, not a response to Guderian’s blitzkrieg tank pincer formations. [199] Today’s version of this is widely believed in U.S. foreign policy circles. It holds that China hawks overstate Chinese capabilities and that the United States has enormous strengths that will lead us to automatically prevail in techno-economic competition. Jude Blanchette and Ryan Hass exemplify this view: Even with its many shortcomings and vulnerabilities, the United States continues to command a strategic depth that China fundamentally lacks: a unique combination of economic vitality, global military superiority, remarkable human capital, and a political system designed to promote the correction of errors. The resilient and adaptable U.S. economy has the world’s deepest and most liquid capital markets and unparalleled influence over the global financial system. The United States continues to attract top global talent, including many Chinese nationals now fleeing their country’s autocratic political environment. Put plainly, the United States still has a vital edge over China in terms of economic dynamism, global influence, and technological innovation. [200] They wrote in answer to the question, “Is China destined to be an economic superpower?”: No. China has made huge, genuine strides in the past four decades, becoming dominant in manufacturing, prominent in many supply chains, and a leader in several high-tech sectors. However, China’s economy has major structural challenges that will constrain growth, and its current economic strategy, which is rooted in pursuing technology leadership, is depressing growth due to industrial-policy waste and growing tensions with trading partners. Going forward, China could encounter a crisis, muddle through with low growth, or revive growth with a more market-oriented strategy. As reports in this series have definitely shown that is simply wishful thinking that relies on ideological platitudes and not on careful analysis of firms, industries and innovation systems. The preponderance of evidence suggests that China has vastly more manufacturing capabilities than America, including and especially in national power industries, and is making much faster progress in innovation. [201] It is common for supporters of the view of U.S. superiority to point to U.S. universities, venture capital, high-skill immigration, and entrepreneurial culture as inherent sources of superiority. Many even still cling to the notion that U.S. manufacturing is strong. Professor and commentator Jerry Harr reflected this view when he wrote, “Examining U.S. manufacturing competitiveness today, one finds that the United States maintains a formidable position in global manufacturing despite facing intensifying international competition.” [202] Yet, comparing U.S. advanced industry output with China’s shows how far behind the United States is. [203] Most U.S. holders of free-market doctrine dismiss the China threat because they believe that free-market economies are inherently superior to more planned economies. A related view comes from CSIS. Its lead China analyst informed, “The United States needs to remember that it has not fallen behind China.” [204] But nowhere on the CSIS China Power project website is any analysis of China’s attempts to master advanced technology industries or any assessment of its progress and success. And to the extent it discusses China’s actions in this realm, it largely suggests that it will fail, presumably just as it has done in steel, EVs, batteries, drones, telecom equipment, solar panels, and high-speed rail. [205] Most U.S. holders of free-market doctrine dismiss the China threat because they believe that free-market economies are inherently superior to more planned economies. As such, there is no way we can lose, unless we become more like China. John Tamny, editor of RealClearMarkets , wrote, “The overblown China panic serves as a reminder of why the U.S. must maintain the market-friendly norms that have long made it the envy of the world.” [206] Box 3: U.S. Optimism: Command of Commerce: America’s Enduring Power Advantage Over China One of the more important questions to get right is whether the United States or China has more techno-economic and trade leverage over the other and what the trend in that dynamic is going. A new book, Command of Commerce , addresses this issue. [207] As the title suggests, it’s not an even, close contest: America dominates. But the authors’ methods and analysis are fundamentally flawed. First, their key claim for U.S. superiority is that U.S. multinationals have a much larger share of profits than Chinese do. But as noted, that’s largely because Chinese firms are willing to accept lower profits (in part because of government subsidies) in order to capture global market share. U.S. firms are not. Moreover, a higher share of Chinese firms are in more competitive segments where profits are low. For example, the profitability of electronics assembly firms is quite low compared with software firms. Does that not mean that being able to make things is not important to national power? They also see profits from sales and marketing as key indicators of national strength. For them, an American firm that outsources low-margin production overseas but makes high profits because of sales and marketing boosts U.S. power. No, it weakens it, even if they argue that higher profits help a nation. They do, but profits are a small share of national income, around 14 percent in the United States. [208] Second, like so many U.S. foreign policy and economic experts, the authors focus on firm nationality and not production location. In the authors’ analysis, a firm such as Boeing or Intel could offshore all its production to China and U.S. power would not diminish because these are U.S. firms. In fact, they argued, power would increase because the USG could order these U.S. firms to stop production in China at any time. But in a war, what matters is not production in other nations, especially your adversaries; it’s production at home. They wrote, “For a nation to be able to transform its manufacturing output into geopolitical leverage it needs to have significant influence over the more complicated manufacturing and design activities that feed into most products, and it needs to have control over where those products are sold.” [209] In other words, they asserted that a U.S. company that designs a product but has it made in Chinese factories, and then sold through the U.S. company’s distribution channel has geopolitical leverage. At one level, it does. The USG can tell it to stop producing in China, although that would mean major job loss and possible bankruptcy of the U.S. company, as sales would crater before it could establish new production facilities somewhere else. But it also means that the U.S. does not have this production domestically. To the extent the industry is dual use, or even enabling, that absence weakens U.S. defense production. And to the extent the United States relies on the products made by a U.S. company in China, it would be cutting off its nose to spite its face. Third, the authors did rightly point to a key metric as allied production strength (even if profits are their key measure). But it’s not at all clear that our allies are really our allies when it comes to China. South Korea and Japan are increasingly split in their loyalties, while the EU, in the face of Trump’s tariffs, is tilting East, not West. Indeed, the EU has still not cut off sales of Huawei 5G equipment within Europe because some EU nations want to save a few euros by buying Chinese. And overall, EU leaders are loathe to give up Chinese markets, which explains why they do so little to embrace U.S. export controls on China. [210] Fourth, the authors ignored important measures. They failed to mention that in 2024 the United States ran a $1.3 trillion trade deficit, with $300 billion of that with China. China ran a $900 billion merchandise trade surplus. [211] Over the last decade, U.S. manufacturing value-added output has grown more slowly than GDP and 14 of 19 major industries saw absolute decline. [212] Moreover, U.S. manufacturing productivity has been stagnant since the early 2010s. [213] While there does not appear to be easily accessible data on Chinese labor productivity growth, overall Chinese productivity growth has been significantly higher than that of the United States. [214] The fact that China now has installed 74 percent more industrial robots per manufacturing worker than the United States has, and installed 7.3 times more in 2013—an even more impressive feat given that Chinese manufacturing wages are significantly lower, which reduces the ROI of robotics installation—suggests strong competitive advantage. [215] Fifth, the authors finally got to the real measures of power when they looked at OECD’s value-added output in various industries. The problem is that they considered only high-tech industries as important—not motor vehicles, where tank production is classified; or shipbuilding, where aircraft carriers are classified; not steel, which weapons systems use; etc. And even more, they included telecommunications services and professional services sectors that have no bearing on national power and leverage. If the Chinese were to cut off all exports to us, we’d still have these two perfectly functioning sectors, because they are not traded, they are domestic. When looking at traded high-tech sectors, as the authors defined them, the OECD data shows that in 2022 (they used 2020 data), the U.S. share was 29.5 percent, with China’s 18.5 percent, a significant U.S. lead. [216] But leaving out the two nontraded sectors, and the nongoods sector of IT and information services, China’s share jumps to 27.7% while the U.S. share falls to 20.7 percent. [217] Moreover, a core mistake the authors made is that they presented a static snapshot of China. They were absolutely correct that in certain sectors such as aerospace, drugs, semiconductors, and equipment that China lags behind the United States. And that does give the United States some breathing room. But in all these industries and more, China’s progress is rapid. For example, from 2016 to 2022, China’s output in other transportation, which includes aerospace, increased four times faster than U.S. value-added output, while its computer and semiconductor output increase twice as fast. And while the United States government is cutting federal R&D, the Chinese government is expanding it. They also argued that Chinese GDP is exaggerated in official CCP figures. This may very well be the case, but it is not the key point if one is considering the global war for advanced industries. If China’s personal services, retail, and legal services market is not expanding, that means lower GDP, but it has no effect on national power industries. Sixth, the book goes all out to make its case. Case in point, the authors reported that because of the U.S. export sanctions, Huawei’s global phone share fell from 11 percent in 2000 to 3.5 percent in 2024. They were either not aware of, or ignored the fact, that about 4 percentage points of that drop was due to Huawei spinning off its lower-end phone business to a new company, Honor. And they overlooked that Huawei is not the world’s largest telecom equipment manufacturer, and its global market share for telecom equipment increased from 29 percent in early 2018 to 31 percent by 2024. [218] Finally, the authors pointed to the fact that the United Staes has used export controls to supposedly hobble China (which they did not in the case of Huawei) while China has refrained from trying to do the same to the United States as evidence that it is weaker technologically and has little leverage. Because of this, the authors amazingly argued for even more export controls against China to weaken it. This betrays a fundamental reading of China. China has no interest in cutting off sales of its products to the United States, because unlike the USG, it realizes that more Chinese sales strengthen its companies and weaken America’s. Moreover, China still benefits from U.S. investment in China, and the technology transfer it gets. It doesn’t close its markets to foreign investment until the industry in question is dominant. It is biding its time to gain even more from foreign firms. Chamberlain probably rightly believed that there was little that France and the United Kingdom could do to deter or weaken Hitler, so he engaged in appeasement. Today, that is a common strategy toward China proposed by many in the foreign policy establishment. The 2019 Open Letter advocates this: “U.S. opposition will not prevent the continued expansion of the Chinese economy, a greater global market share for Chinese companies and an increase in China’s role in world affairs.” [219] On what basis do they make this assertion, other than they value engagement above all else? Why wouldn’t a strategy of limiting Chinese exports and working with our allies to do the same result in China having less global market share instead of more? However, for them, even if we could do something to limit China’s rise, we shouldn’t because it would hurt ourselves. The authors went on to write that “the United States cannot significantly slow China’s rise without damaging itself.” [220] China scholar Susan Shirk agreed, stating that “there is no objective measure to suggest that a dramatic reduction in the extent or quality of China’s participation in global commerce and finance would do anything except harm economic growth in the United States.” [221] A Brookings report in 2022 expressed the same sentiment that the fight will be costly, so it will hurt us. It states that: Fully extracting Chinese firms from Department of Defense supply chains, including those that produce rare earth minerals for example, would likely be infeasible, and may discourage innovation by imposing costs that would likely be insurmountable for start-up companies. [222] It goes on the criticize the idea that the United States should produce more key goods that we compete for with China, presumably because it would entail the dreaded “industrial policy” and because it would cost money: While it is reasonable to geographically diversify this particular portfolio, the imperative should not be applied more broadly to the high-tech industry overall. The goal of subsidies, tax breaks, and loan guarantee programs should be to incentivize greater supply chain resilience in sectors that are vital for the provision of necessary public goods; it should not be to strengthen the balance sheet of domestic firms or increase domestic production of high-tech goods and services per se. [223] And above all, the authors worry that tariffs “increase the costs of goods for consumers.” [224] Why not eliminate the U.S. defense budget because it raises costs for taxpayers? We would be much better off spending money on consumer goods than defense goods if we didn’t have to worry about national defense. And besides, this broad assertion of self-damage, made with no real logic, is certainly true with some actions, but not with others. Limiting the imports of national power industry goods or services produced unfairly helps, not hurts the United States. After WWII, the entire U.S. defense and foreign policy establishment focused on Europe, largely ignoring Asia. The belief was that if Stalin attacked, he would go West, not Southeast. But Stalin, and Mao, had other ideas, giving the green light to North Korea’s Marxist-Leninist dictator Kim Il-Sung to invade South Korea. The analogy to today is the notion of derisking: a denial of the China threat and capabilities. Popular in the EU—which abhors having to take a stand against China and can’t dare to consider that the old vision of globalization (a world where no nation other than America needs to spend money on defense) is dead, and wants to sell as much to China as it can—the idea is that it’s only a few industries that we have to fight for to “derisk” from China. [225] In a recent EU report on derisking, the EU Parliament wrote: According to Ursula von der Leyen, de-risking is not exclusively vis-à-vis China, as it is about ‘managing the risks we see, addressing excessive dependencies through diversification of our supply chains. This is a positive communication move, as it has the potential to be better perceived in China than the triptych (China as a cooperation partner-economic competitor, systemic rival. [226] Jake Sullivan also supported this strategy when he proposed, “De-risking and diversifying, not decoupling.” [227] In other words, the EU above all does not want to make the CCP mad by calling it a systematic rival. The term derisking allows, the EU believes, the limiting of some dependencies on China while not making it so angry that it limits EU sales to China, something the EU puts at the top of its agenda with China. The EU report goes on to state, “Trade and openness are deeply engrained within the European project, and the more moderate de-risking concept is meant as a way to find a better equilibrium between seizing opportunities and managing risks.” [228] The EU above all does not want to make the CCP mad by calling it a systematic rival. The term derisking allows, the EU believes, the limiting of some dependencies on China while not making it so angry that it limits EU sales to China, something the EU puts at the top of its agenda with China. “Seizing opportunities” is a euphemism for selling more to China, especially if it comes at the expense of U.S. exports, while welcoming Chinese factories to be built in the EU. [229] The report goes on to narrow the scope for derisking, even embracing more dependency on China: In many fields, European firms also look to the Chinese market and Chinese partners not only for research and development opportunities, but also as a source of technology. Ultimately, the de-risking approach proposed by the Commission may be considered one of risk mitigation or management, rather than a cleansing exercise. Indeed, many companies, Member States and even the Commission seek generally to maintain avenues of economic and technological cooperation, ensuring that China remains a partner for Europe in areas that do not constitute a palpable risk for Europe’s security. [230] The EU also defines derisking not as only with China, but amazingly also with the United States: “De-risking is strongly tied to the EU Economic Security Strategy that goes beyond China.” [231] And the EU seeks to derisk from the United States, as the recent “Draghi report” suggests. [232] When it talks about strategic dependencies in the IT hardware sector, it talks more about the United States than it does about China. In the fact, the report is only partially focused on China, with much of the discussion on the United States’ techno-economic capabilities. Finally, there are a range of strategic approaches that largely ignore either attacking Chinese capabilities or defending against its techno-economic aggression, and instead focus only on ways the United States can improve. France relied on defense against Hitler. It failed. A similar approach is in vogue in the United States today. In a report for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Jon Bateman argued that “the primary effort should be ‘offensive’: new investments and incentives to bolster and diversify innovation pathways, supply chains, talent pipelines, and revenue models in strategic technology areas.” [233] In a 2018 article in Foreign Affairs , Kurt Campbell and Ely Ratner, former members of the Biden administration. argued: The starting point for a better approach is a new degree of humility about the United States’ ability to change China. Neither seeking to isolate and weaken it nor trying to transform it for the better should be the lodestar of U.S. strategy in Asia. Washington should instead focus more on its own power and behavior, and the power and behavior of its allies and partners. [234] Even if the United States had the political will to come together to fight the war and the willingness to commit the significant resources to spur domestic competitiveness, that would still not be enough. A Biden interim national security guideline issued in March 2021 echoes this: “[O]ur enduring advantages will allow us to prevail in strategic competition with China or any other nation.” [235] It went on to note, “The most effective way for America to out-compete a more assertive and authoritarian China over the long-term is to invest in our people, our economy, and our democracy.” [236] Even if the United States had the political will to come together to fight the war and the willingness to commit the significant resources to boost domestic competitiveness, that would still not be enough. The CCP’s pockets and tools will always be deeper and sharper than America’s. In the U.S. Civil War, General McLellan let Robert E. Lee intimidate him and set the stage for where to fight. McLelland reacted and retreated. But Ulysses S. Grant did not, famously stating, “I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.” [237] McLellan’s thinking is what passes for much of U.S. competitiveness and tech policy thinking today. Well, we can’t compete with China in “x” (e.g., drones, telecom equipment, chemicals, and even manufacturing generally), so we will retreat to higher ground of “x.” Usually, “x” is AI. Well, China is good at manufacturing, but we are good at AI, so we can let them have manufacturing; we will win in AI. Some justify this by hyping AI as the secret weapon in the techno-economic war—akin to Hitler’s jet fighters and V-2 rockets. Once the United States gets to artificial general intelligence (AGI) or even artificial superintelligence (ASI), the war is over, and the United States has won. AGI will give us utmost power to outcompete China everywhere. As one study puts it: The contest between China and the United States to harness the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) has become this generation’s defining technological rivalry. The report concludes that America’s ability to shape AI’s trajectory depends on extending its technological advantage over China as much as possible. Rather than focusing on unlikely cooperation, the United States must pursue decisive technical superiority fueled by a vision for American AI that advances democratic values and global development. Effectively managing the fraught issues on AI’s horizon can strengthen the United States’ soft power and technological advantage; failing to do so risks derailing American AI progress and ceding ground to Beijing. [238] It is a seductive notion, but likely as wrong as Hitler’s betting the war on Wunderwaffen (wonder weapons) rather than more tanks. First, China is making rapid progress in AI. It’s not like the 1990s with “Wintelism” (Windows and Intel) and U.S. dominance in personal computing and then the Internet. China is in the game. Second, it is a bet-the-farm risk that AI is the superweapon of the techno-economic war. What if AI is just another normal, albeit important technology? A technology that improves production in many sectors, but does not transform the world like never before. In that case, AI will not be able to preserve our national power industries such as drugs, aerospace, chips, machine tools, chemicals, etc. That, rather than sci-fi stories about ASI is the much more likely outcome, at least in the next quarter century when this conflict really matters. A related story is that it’s not just AI, but rather a host of emerging technologies that will save us. Through the magic of Silicon Valley, America will lead in the industries of the future: blockchain, humanoid robots, quantum, synthetic biology, 3D printing, and of course AI. Biden’s Secretary of State Antony Blinken agreed, identifying six technologies as core to the U.S. competitive strategy: “microelectronics, advanced computing and quantum technologies, artificial intelligence, biotechnology and biomanufacturing, advanced telecommunications, and clean energy technologies.” [239] (Although the administration never bothered to explain why clean energy is strategic when we have lots of dirty energy.) It seems like advocates of this view get their understanding of technology from Wired Magazine , focused on the cool, cutting-edge stuff, much of what they experience in their own lives. No need to fight to win the silicon chip wars; just develop the next generation of processors such as neuromorphic computing and the like. [240] No need to win the compute wars; just jump ahead to quantum. Don’t worry about the chemical sector; embrace “synthetic biology.” [241] And don’t forget, we have Silicon Valley; we can afford to cede the rest of the territory as long as we have the commanding heights of the Valley. This wrongly implies that atom-based industries—or “deep tech”—such as aerospace, vehicles, machine tools, and chemicals are not strategic. Moreover, for all the wonder of Silicon Valley, it’s just not that big, accounting for just 1.5 percent of U.S. GDP. [242] The problems with this approach are similar to those of AI. First, capacity in breakthrough technologies often comes from leadership in prior technologies. Biotech breakthroughs depend on strong, large U.S. biopharmaceutical companies. 6G might come from startups, but more likely it will come from incumbents such as Qualcomm and Ericsson. Quantum could come from new entrants, but existing IT and computer companies are more likely to develop it. Second, the United States has a long history of leading in innovative breakthroughs only to lose production to other nations. Why would this time be any different if the fundamental U.S. strategy and policy remain the same? In fact, with China poised to hoover up U.S. breakthrough knowledge and commercialize it in China, one would expect even more of the same pattern. China is fighting hard in all of them, and some of these industries have a very similar dynamic to ones that the United States has already lost to China. The United States has a long history of leading in innovative breakthroughs only to lose production to other nations. Why would this time be any different if the fundamental U.S. strategy and policy remain the same? Third, there is no reason to expect that the United States will win all these sectors, especially with the deep cuts in federal funding for research. It was much easier for the United States to win past tech breakthroughs when the federal government funded such a massive amount of research. It no longer does. Finally, there are many sectors, such as machine tools, basic chemicals, and others that are strategic but not cutting-edge, cool, high-tech. These and others are less likely to experience breakthrough innovations that could launch new companies in the United States. Another strategy, related to the AI and emerging technologies ones, is to rely on some kind of vague, promised scientific innovations. Presumably, this pays off in commercial success in the United States and in strategic industries and technologies. In a report for CSIS, Rand’s Mike Mazzar wrote, “The domestic foundation for success in turn has three major components: nurturing a supportive ecosystem for science and technology, promoting diffusion, and managing the wider social effects of technology for competitive advantage.” [243] His first component for U.S. success is, “The domestic U.S. foundations of scientific and technological innovation, including the supporting science and technology ecosystem, must remain at a world-class level.” [244] This is a widely held view that a better science system will go a long way toward saving us. In a 2022 speech, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan stated, “Advancements in science and technology are poised to define the geopolitical landscape of the 21st century. They will generate game-changers in health and medicine, food security, and clean energy. We’ll see leap-ahead breakthroughs and new industries that drive our prosperity.” [245] In his otherwise excellent book, David Shambaugh reflected this conventional wisdom when he wrote, “We also need to invest considerable sums into basic scientific research in order to maintain all American comparative advantage in innovation.” [246] This is an appealing and safe framing because it doesn’t require a dreaded strategic industry strategy that involves picking winners. It doesn’t even involve the painful task of telling U.S. scientists that they have to do more work related to the national interest. Rather, it’s grounded in the more widely accepted view that government can play the key role in innovation by funding scientific research that U.S. scientists choose to focus on. But it also reflects a shallow and misguided view of how innovation takes place and even what it is. Innovation is not scientific discovery, something that is now available widely around the globe. Innovation is the successful bringing to the market of a new product, process, or service, and beating the competition while doing it. Innovation doesn’t come from STEM workers or science funding. It comes from organizations with embedded knowledge. That requires a deep understanding of organizational production and corporate strategy. And sophisticated organizations anywhere on the planet can absorb a significant portion of the science breakthroughs funded by the USG. Exactly how does the U.S. military fight wars with the best lawyers, consultants, accountants, and universities? The ultimate retreat is to say that no particular part of land is strategic enough to defend. This is the view of the “potato chips, computers chips, what’s the difference?” group. In this view, all industries are the same. Who cares if America manufactures anything; it’s dirty and dull anyway? We will take the commanding heights of global finance, business consulting, content, and higher education. A report from CSIS summarizes the view: “What is missing from both strategies for competing with China is a focus on what is too often the unsung driver of U.S. competitiveness: services.” [247] Exactly how does the U.S. military fight wars with the best lawyers, consultants, accountants, and universities? But these are soothing visions. No need to fight. You walk away from the aggressor. You do better things than the aggressor. Still another distraction from the war is the view by elites, especially global business elites and fellow travelers in the academic and punditry, which is that the problem is with the West and that only a new kind of capitalism will save it. Besides implying a self-loathing of Western capitalism, this view is a major distraction from the task at hand of not letting the West lose in national power industry war. One example is the famous (or infamous) Trilateral Commission, whose “Task Force on Global Capitalism in Transition” argued that it is Western capitalism that is inherently problematic, something that is remarkably similar to what Xi Jinping says. [248] The Task Force has argued, “There are growing concerns about whether market-based economies will be able to adequately address climate change, the disruptions triggered by the digital revolution, and rising inequalities. Moving toward a more sustainable and inclusive capitalism is thus a defining challenge of our age.” [249] In other words, climate and inequality demand a new kind of capitalism. Maybe even capitalism with Chinese characteristics? In fact, the Task Force has lauded the CCP’s efforts as fellow reform travelers: “Even China—the largest beneficiary of global capitalism over the past 40 years—launched a campaign in 2021 to curb ‘the disorderly expansion of capital.’” [250] It appears that they did not know that the disorder the CCP was trying to put in order was from companies not investing in ensuring Chinese global dominance in national power industries. The Task Force has even stated that the Chinese economy arguably meets the criteria for a capitalist system. Hence, China is in the club with America seeking “the transition in global capitalism” to a happy, clean, more equal sixth phase. And of course, the World Economic Forum (WEF) is at the forefront of this kind of self-flagellation. Former director Klaus Schwab recently stated, “We now have a window of opportunity to create this Global Reset which we all need. This Global Reset is necessary because we have seen how our policies which we pursued before the coronavirus struck us because those policies do not create the necessary inclusion of society necessary for harmonious societal development.” [251] Was he not aware that the term “harmonious societal development” is a CCP global talking point to attack the Western model of development? [252] It’s worth adding that this was from a person who told a Chinese forum, “We are coming out, thanks also to the leadership of China in terms of fighting the pandemic.” [253] And he was “happy to see China putting high priorities on developing its ‘fourth industrial revolution’ capabilities.” [254] Sounding like China Daily, WEF touts that China is “driving global growth,” “reshaping food systems,” and powering a “remarkable green transition.” It is even helping the world with its rare earth minerals policies. WEF sees China as no different than any other nation, except it’s bigger, provides more benefits, and is more committed to free trade than America is. One WEF article about China at Davos 2025 states, “China showcased its transition from traditional growth drivers to a new model centered on domestic consumption, advanced manufacturing, and green transformation, while emphasizing continued commitment to opening up amid geopolitical tensions.” [255] Yes, that would be the “new” model on domestic consumption the CCP has been promising without delivering for the last 15 years. Yes, if you consider green transition to be China’ coal-fired power plant construction hitting a 10-year high. [256] And yes, if it’s possible to commit to opening up while simultaneously shutting out more and more foreign companies from its markets. And the writer went on to castigate America for being closed: The recent US Department of Defense designation of CATL as a “Chinese military company” highlighted the challenges ahead for Chinese companies operating globally. While Chinese officials and business leaders consistently emphasized openness and collaboration, there was clear recognition of the need to navigate an increasingly complex international environment. [257] Sounding like China Daily, WEF touts that China is “driving global growth,” “reshaping food systems,” and powering a “remarkable green transition.” It is even helping the world with its rare earth minerals policies. [258] (True, if helping means putting the rest of the world’s rare earth miners and processors out of business.) And the author, a professor educated in China and now teaching in Australia, has argued, “A more balanced narrative is the first step towards a coherent, globally coordinated policy response.” [259] That is CCP speak for, “Stop criticizing us.” The pacifist Quincy Institute agrees, blaming capitalism for U.S.-China competition: The United States and China are trapped in zero-sum economic competition today because neoliberal globalization consistently failed to create the broad growth that would allow prosperity in all countries… The U.S. and China are thus locked in a zero-sum struggle that is distracting both sides from the root causes of the conflict and strengthening the forces of authoritarianism and nationalism in both countries. [260] Ahh, if only the United States abandoned “neoliberalism,” the CCP could get back to what it really wants to do: boost the Chinese proletariat. In WWII, Krupp was the major defense contractor in Germany, and Hitler relied on it for building superweapons to win the war. Today, there is a similar myopic focus of just reforming defense procurement in order to address the China threat. U.S. industrial policy for defense goods was seen as necessary because markets would fail. But an industrial policy for dual-use and enabling industries? That’s a whole other matter. Much of the discussion of national power industry competition with China focuses narrowly on the defense industrial base and the myriad of reforms offered to improve it. These range from more competition, more procurement from the civilian sector, multi-year procurement, more foreign military sales, more allied cooperation and specialization, and of course, more flexible contracting and funding mechanisms. [261] It’s not that these proposals are not useful, they very well may be. But the belief that we cannot lose the power industry war with China by only improving how DOD spends its procurement and R&D budgets is wishful thinking. In the first half of the 20th century, the Swiss had a great strategy: let the rest of Europe destroy itself by making sure that the costs of invading mountainous Switzerland were very high and that Switzerland would stay neutral. The problem with this strategy was that it could have let either the Nazis or the Soviets control Europe. But still, the redoubt strategy is attractive and seductive. Many neo-protectionist Republicans want to erect high mountains from tariffs and therefore couldn’t care less about what other nations, including China, do. Tariffs will ensure that the American economy will be self-sufficient and that China can do it little harm, at least economically. In this view, while a country such as Canada or the United Kingdom couldn’t do that because their GDP is too small, the U.S. market is big enough to let every industry comfortably produce and thrive, as long as they are protected by high enough tariff walls. The problems with this strategy are many. Most importantly, it ensures that China wins the global war. It may not “occupy our land” (e.g., hollow out our strategic industries), but it is likely to occupy the rest of the world. The United States would find itself living in a world where our influence would be minimal: no country would want to risk alienating the hegemon of Beijing. Just look at Europe now, tiptoeing around in fear of aggravating the CCP (or India, going to Beijing to get closer). Imagine how obsequious Europe would be without the United States to protect it. A protectionist redoubt is a prescription for U.S. national power industry decline. Second, most strategic industries that are technologically advanced, such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, aerospace, fine chemicals, and more, require global market share to survive. The fixed cost is too high to hope to recover them in a market even as large as the United States’. A protectionist redoubt is a prescription for U.S. national power industry decline. Just as in World WWII and the Cold War with the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc, the only effective strategy is to stand and fight collectively. We have to take a stand. Like General Grant in the battle of the Wilderness: no more retreat. not one step back, only attacking the next day. Or like in World War II, when the Nazis were relentless in their advance and the Soviets had their backs to the wall, Stalin issued his famous not one step back order. While it meant hundreds of thousands of Soviet military deaths, it also meant that the back of the Wehrmacht would be broken. Accepting that this is the only acceptable high-level strategy means a fundamental reexamination and reformulation of past institutional arrangements and policies. This means disruption and rethinking past assumptions about globalization, financial capitalism, the role of government, and the regulatory state. And it means embracing the development and implementation of a strategy to not lose the war. In this sense, the Kennan concept of containment is the right one. Kennan understood the threat to the West from Soviet communist expansionism. And he knew that the ability of the West to defeat the Soviets, especially militarily, was minimal—at least until the Soviet Union began to fall significantly far behind the United States as they started doing in the 1970s. As such, the strategy was to limit the ability of the Soviet bloc to develop (through export controls and limited trade) while limiting its ability to expand into allied nations, and finally working to gain the hearts and minds of the unaligned world. Today, the United States does not have the capability to defeat China from a techno-economic perspective. We might have been 20 years ago, when the techno-economic capabilities ratio was much more in our favor, but it no longer is. While various export controls and other means might throw a wrench into Chinese progress (delaying them and raising costs), there is no evidence or reason to believe that it can keep the CCP from its ultimate goal of techno-economic domination. The goal has to be, first and foremost, not letting the CCP win the battles for strategic industries in allied nations. The reason is simple: more sales for its strategic industry firms means more innovation and lower costs for China. Fewer sales for our strategic industry firms mean less innovation and higher costs for us. An overarching strategy for how to do that is laid out ahead, but for now, suffice to say it involves offense (supporting domestic companies in their battles) and defense (limiting Chinese companies’ access to our markets). Unless the United States rejects both free-market-based consumer welfare economics and progressive, quasi-socialist worker economics and instead adopts a national power economics doctrine and framework, it will lose the war. Taking this seriously and to heart has major implications for the nation. First, it means that we have to give less attention to many of the political hot-button issues that the Right and the Left are willing to go the ramparts for. And it means, just as in the Cold War, that the American people and our leaders need to admit and bear the very serious costs that engaging in this war will cost. JFK said that “ we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.” [262] Few Americans likely believe that today; in fact, many are ambivalent about the very value of liberty. As such, setting that as the core strategy is paramount. But unless the United States rejects both free-market-based consumer welfare economics and progressive, quasi-socialist worker economics and instead adopts a national power economics doctrine and framework, it will lose the war. Two economic doctrines compete for U.S. dominance: free-market, consumer welfare economics and neo-New Deal worker-oriented progressivism. Most economic policy, including trade, technology, tax and budget, and regulatory policy is grounded in the discipline of economics. In America’s case, this is neo-classical economics. Another term for it is consumer welfare-focused economics because the goal is maximizing consumer welfare, ideally by allowing the free reign of market forces enabling the efficient allocation of resources. In this frame, policies are usually judged by their effects on consumers and free markets. The free trade, free-market think tank The Peterson Institute reflects that view when it argued that: the United States cannot and should not have as its policy goal greater self-sufficiency across a wide range of activities. The nation—and the manufacturing sector in particular—is too deeply engaged in international trade to make that advisable. Furthermore, the efficiency gains from this diversification of supply are substantial. [263] And in this view, efficiency is maximized when prices are set by natural supply and demand forces in markets. A minimum wage: bad because it substitutes government dictate for market forces and hurts consumers. Tariffs: bad because they substitute government dictate for market forces and hurt consumers. Industry subsidies: bad because they substitute government dictate for market forces and hurt consumers in their role as taxpayers. Company market power: bad because it gives them the ability to limit supply or raise prices in ways that true free markets would not. In conventional economics, consumption is paramount. Trade deficits are actually good because they enable more consumption. No industry is more important than any other because consumer spending determines which industries are important. And foreign subsidization of export industries are good for the United States because they lead to lower prices. If these countries are dumb enough to give us “discounts” on their exports, we’d be dumb to say no. As such, this doctrine sees limiting Chinese auto imports to the United States as bad economic policy because consumers lose. Ignore the fact that much of China’s cost advantage comes from government subsidies and a suppressed currency and that open imports would likely significantly harm U.S. auto producers. And because companies make profits by most efficiently serving consumer needs, strong profits are a reflection of a strong economy. In this theory, the fact that U.S. firms are vastly more profitable than Chinese firms means not only that the U.S. system is better than the Chinese system, but also that the United States is stronger. Indeed, the United States has evolved into a society where it seems that stock prices are the paramount concern. Stocks up, economy strong. Stocks down, economy weak. A Council of Foreign Relations article on China reflects this consensus consumer welfare view: U.S. trade with China has grown enormously in recent decades and is crucial for both countries. Today, China is one of the largest export markets for U.S. goods and services (second to Mexico), and the United States is the top export market for China. This trade—much of which grew after China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001—has brought lower prices to U.S. consumers and higher profits for U.S. corporations. [264] Andy Rothman, an American financial advisor in China, argued: C hina drives global economic growth, so a sound bilateral relationship is important to American consumers and workers, as well as to families who are counting on stock market returns to pay for their retirement. In the 10 years through 2019, China, on average, accounted for about one third of global economic growth. [265] By definition, national power is an externality. From a consumer-welfare perspective, defense spending is a waste—as are, for the conventional economists, national power industry policies. In this system, if U.S. companies offshore manufacturing or exit from manufacturing altogether, this is optimal, for two reasons. First, by definition, whatever market forces lead to is optimal, as it reflects the most efficient allocation of resources. Second, offshoring must lead to higher profits for firms exiting low-margin industries or business segments. And as we have seen, higher profits are seen as synonymous with a strong economy. If investing in software and information services firms generated higher profits than investing in factories did, then it is American firms that are the smart ones and the American economy that is the strong one. Box 4: Adam Smith: Wrong and Misinterpreted It’s striking that few people seem to think it strange that the core economic thinkers for both today’s Left and Right—Karl Marx and Adam Smith, respectively—put pen to paper more than 150 years ago. Maybe antiquity is why their works are treated as scripture. But Marx is far worse than Smith, in retrospect. Most of what he wrote is completely wrong, including his claim that capitalism repeals the laws of competition such that all the fruits of technological progress go to the capitalists. [266] And of course, his followers were responsible for unspeakable crimes against humanity. While Adam Smith is not as wrong as Marx was, at times, it’s a close call. Why does this matter? Because the principle intellectual grounding today, at least among the Right and Center, in America against a national power industry strategy finds it succor in Smith’s 1976 Wealth of Nations. Smith’s famous line, “By pursuing his own interest [an individual] frequently promotes that of society the more effectually than when he really intends to promote it,” has morphed into biblical certainty. [267] To be sure, the pursuit of individual profit can and often does lead to societal benefit. But this is such a simplistic framing, it’s blatant in its obviousness. What about the cases where self-interest is not enough? This gets to Smith’s core error: his disregard of production externalities. Economists define an externalitiy as a side effect or consequence of an industrial or commercial activity that affects other parties without being reflected in the cost of the goods or services involved. If these are minimal, than a Smithian world does produce optimally. But even in Smith’s time, they were not minimal—and in a world driven by advanced tehcnology, they are even more ubiquitous and important. The reality is that the success of any one venture depends on the success of many others, both public and private. If an individual in Smith’s time wanted to open a pin-making factory, he would have had a hard time if there had had also not been companies making steel and tools to cut the steel. In other words, success of companies depends in part not just on entrepreneurial will and vigor, especially in technologically complex industries, but also on the overall industrial ecosystem. And because companies are indifferent to externalities, by definition—they are external to the firm—relying on firms alone can lead to underperformance. Markets seldom solve externalities on their own. Governments do though. Smtih was also wrong when it came to domestic vs. foreign production. While Smith was accurately describing his times, he did not worry about the negative effect of offshoring production because doing so was quite difficult. Indeed, he wrote that “every individual endeavors to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry.” [268] But what happens to his laissez-faire model if moving production to Shanghai is as easy as moving it to Sheffield? In other cases, Smith qualified his statements with important caveats, but these are largely ignored by die-hard free-market, consumer-welfare economists. Even before David Ricardo, Smith argued that it made no sense to produce something domestically when it could be purchased more cheaply from abroad. This obvious insight is treated as Nobel Prize-winning genius and used to inform all of U.S. trade policy. Sure, it makes no sense for the United States to grow coffee, but what about other things such as cars and semiconductors? It seems as if free-market Smithians never bothered to read: “There seem, however, to be two cases, in which it will generally be advantage to lay some burden upon foreign, for the encouragement of domestic industry.” [269] In other words, Smith did not rule out government action for trade competitiveness, and in fact, downright encouraged it. The first is for defense industry. He wrote, “The first is when some particular sort of industry is necessary for the defense of the country.” Given the criticality of the British navy at the time, he used the case of shipbuilding. If he had been writing in the 1920s, he would have mentioned airplanes. As Barnett Corelli wrote regarding The Wealth of Nations , “This vital distinction was totally lost by nineteenth-century apostles of Free Trade.” [270] And, it could be added, by 21st century apostles of free trade in the United States. For Smithians, free markets and free trade, by definition, maximize what Smith termed “opulence.” Smith went on to note a second key caveat to free markets and trade: The second case, in which it will generally be advantageous to lay some burden upon foreign countries for the encouragement of domestic industry, is when some tax is imposed at home upon the produce of the latter. In this case, it seems reasonable that an equal tax should be imposed on the like produce of the former. [271] He wrote that when a foreign nation limits imports of goods, the home nation has an advantage if the other nation should impose some “duties or prohibitions upon the importation of some or all of their manufacturers into ours.” [272] But to be fair, he only proposed that as a tactic to get the foreign nation to reduce its distortions. If they would not, then the home nation should do nothing. Except if the industry were important to national defense. This all gets to the fundamental flaw of Adam Smith’s doctrine, which Barnett rightly calls “(classical) liberalism.” In his book The Decline of British Power , he wrote, “This swift decline in British vigor at home and the failure to exploit the empire were not owing to some inevitable senescent process of history. They shared a specific cause. That cause was political doctrine; a doctrine blindly believed in long after it had ceased to correspond with reality.” [273] He went on to say: The doctrine was liberalism, which criticized and finally demolished the traditional conception of the nation-state as a collective organism, a community; and asserted the primacy of the individual. According to liberal thinking, a nation was no more than so many human atoms who happened to live under the same set of laws. From such belief it followed that the State, instead of being the embodiment of a national community as it had been under the Tudors and the Commonwealth, was required to dwindle into a kind of policeman, standing apart from the national life, and with the merely negative task of keeping the free-for-all of individual competition with the bounds of decorum. [274] He noted that as Adam Smith brought this doctrine to the fore, when it came to the national production system, the doctrine held, “What was socially necessary could be safely untrusted to spontaneous creation by private initiative.” [275] The problem then for Britain was when advanced economies evolved from small production shops with limited technological sophistication to mass production factories of increasing scientific and technological sophistication, Britain was completely unprepared. As Barnett wrote, “The English therefore entered the industrial era—the era of organization—with a deep-seated horror or organization, the larger the organization the greater the horror.” [276] Spoken as a true neo-Brandeisian of the Left or Right would today. We see that in the United States after the rise of traditional liberalism and libertarian, free-market economics in the 1970s. Free-market scholars such as Oliver Williamson dealt with the horror of organization by simply assuming it away, seeing large corporations merely as a way to reduce transaction costs among self-interested individuals. [277] As a result, with the exception of wartime, the role of the British state was limited to writing reports about how backward British business was and how that threatened national security. As Barnett wrote, “To suggest in Britain in the late nineteenth century that the government should guide the industrial and commercial life of the nation was like suggesting medical treatment to a Jehovah’s Witness.” [278] This was a doctrinal spell that was cast over the British leaders. Again, Barnett: “Like an enchantment, liberal doctrine seemed to blind British eyes and paralysis British willpower.” [279] This was, to say the least, a crisis of utmost proportions as Germany, Japan, and the United States were racing ahead, all three with at least some, if not strong, support from government. [280] Barnett continued, “Thus after 1870 liberal economic doctrine itself was the most catastrophically inappropriate of all the outdated components of British economic development.” [281] And as it became clearer and clearer on just how far Britain was falling behind, even as many continued to keep their head in the sands of denial (as in the United States today), he wrote, “No evidence of foreign success therefore shook the general British faith in British industry.” [282] While the parallels of British history then are certainly not exact with the American situation today, there are striking similarities. Liberalism dominates U.S. political economy thinking, and with it the belief that no industry is more important than others, that trade is largely welfare-maximizing, and that state policy is not needed, other than in the form of limited regulations and taxes and perhaps science spending and immigration, to ensure national power industry capabilities. To use Smith’s terms, it is time to give more priority to “power” and less to “opulence.” There are two key problems with this conceptualization that consumer and investor welfare is synonymous with national welfare. First, this might be true, or at least truer, if we were talking about net-present value welfare. But all too often stock prices go up when companies take steps that weaken their long-term position but strengthen their quarterly or yearly financials. When CEO Mark Hurd was cutting Hewlett Packard’s long-term investments, including in R&D, he helped drive HP stock prices through the roof. Yet, the real net present value of the firm was declining, as was made clear when this “rob the future to pay the present” strategy was made clear to shareholders. Second, even consumer-welfare economists recognize the existence of externalities wherein the costs or benefits from an individual actor’s decision (including a firm) are not the same as the costs or benefits to society. But despite their incorporation of externalities in economic theory, for the most part, they ignore them, especially when advising on policy. Their view is that externalities are too messy, too uncertain, and too open to manipulation by politics. Let’s pretend they don’t exist, and that market forces alone produce optimality. But, by definition, national power is an externality. From a consumer-welfare perspective, defense spending is a complete waste—as are, for the conventional economists, national power industry policies. But clearly defending the nation from aggression is an important benefit, even if individual consumers or firms taxed to pay for it don’t benefit. At the end of the day, national power industries have much in common with pure defense industries, and their strength provides important national benefits. It is inappropriate to blame conventional economists for the paucity of their theory and concepts. Consumer welfare economics is what it is, and it certainly has its uses. But its uses are close to zero when it comes to shaping and guiding national industry power strategy. Where mainstream economists deserve blame is veering from their lane to negatively pontificate against a national power industry strategy. They should stick to their knitting: issues such as interest rates, the problems with housing price controls, and the like. Leave national power industry strategy to the experts. Consumer welfare economics is what it is, and it certainly has its uses. But its uses are close to zero when it comes to shaping and guiding national industry power strategy. This means that conventional economics as practiced in the United States and Commonwealth nations, and to somewhat lesser extent in Europe, can no longer by the lodestar guide shaping national economic policy. It was not designed to operate in a national power trade world, and it was not designed to generate national power industry strength. As such, it is now fundamentally harmful to the nation, and if it continues to be the policy bible, it will lead to the decline of the United States. The reality of this techno-economic and trade attack fundamentally undercuts the foundation of consumer welfare economics, and exposes its inability to address the current challenge. If national power, not consumer welfare, is the ultimate goal, this doctrine fails, at least for guiding the share of the economy composed of national economic power industries. If a nation’s industrial mix is critical, then this doctrine of “potato chips, computer chips, what’s the difference?” fails. While there has been growing criticism of consumer welfare economics—what its critics call “neoliberalism”—the replacement that most on the Left have adopted is no better in dealing with the China threat; in fact, it is likely worse. A broad-strokes consensus has gelled around the contours of a neo-New Deal economic agenda marked by redistribution, global economic autarky, and worker-centric animus toward large corporations and markets. If implemented, neo-New Dealism might generate a one-time reduction in inequality, but it would come at the longer-term cost of economic stagnation, fiscal crisis, and greatly diminished U.S. national power industry capabilities. In its worst form, neo-New Dealism would severely erode the meritocratic, individualist capitalist system as America has known it. Progressive journalist Michael Tomasky perhaps defined neo-New Dealism best. He calls it “middle-out economics” which “is the belief that prosperity comes from a thriving middle class, and therefore government plays a role in supporting families and communities. This version of capitalism—more just, more equal, and in which prosperity is shared—could be the American future.” [283] Many of those who have turned toward neo-New Dealism hold a deep skepticism toward corporations, markets, and American global power. Proponents of neo-New Dealism, a faction that now includes much more than just the Bernie Sanders and “Squad” wing of the Democratic Party, insist that they are just providing a needed alternative to neoliberalism, filling a gap that needed filling. But with its animus toward large companies; its deep suspicion of markets, globalization, and capitalism; its focus on short-term worker welfare; and its overriding goal of redistributing rather than growing the pie, neo-New Dealism would mean losing the national power industry war with China. Sadly, some Republicans have begun to embrace some of these progressive views, especially the animus toward large corporations, the focus on redistribution, and their putting worker interests ahead of national interests, especially related to automation and technology. Neo-New Dealism is about redistribution that ignores, and often rejects, growth (e.g., it’s bad for the planet, it only helps the rich get richer, it creates too much disruption, etc.). Its “middle out” agenda—including eliminating college debt; free health care, elder care, college tuition, and childcare; weakened IP protection; drug price controls; mandates on companies, such as forcing Internet service providers (ISPs) to sell broadband at a loss; breaking up big companies and limiting productivity-enhancing mergers; subsidizing more expensive clean energy; and even a universal basic income more is a way to divide a fixed pie, not grow it. Its proposed massive spending on social policy goals and redistribution would leave little to invest in national power industries. To be fair, neo-New Dealers are not averse to “industrial policy.” But most of their “investments” would be to advance their “green equity” agenda of clean energy, human service industries such as childcare and eldercare, subsidized housing, and mass transit. In a report for the Brookings Institution, Harvard professor Dani Rodrik has advocated for “good jobs,” including more jobs in nursing homes. [284] And of course, its anticorporate, neo-Brandeisian antitrust agenda would mean constant attacks on large corporations doing battle with CCP-backed national champions. And its pro-worker fixation would mean an anti-automation agenda, something that is critical to not losing to China that has the opposite effect: automation full steam ahead. Sadly, some Republicans have begun to embrace some of these progressive views, especially the animus toward large corporations, the focus on redistribution (in this case, to working-class families rather than on race, as the Democrats focus more on), and their putting worker interests ahead of national interests, especially related to automation and technology. [285] Emulating the progressives’ neo-New Dealism “middle-out” framing, Oren Cass, the founder and president of American Compass, a conservative reform organization, has written: This response emerges from an insight that I like to call the working hypothesis: that a labor market in which workers can support strong families and communities is the central determinant of long-term prosperity and should be the central focus of public policy. Genuine prosperity depends upon people working as productive contributors to their society, through which they can achieve self-sufficiency, support their families, participate in their communities, and raise children prepared to do the same. [286] The reality of the CCP’s techno-economic and trade war on the West undercuts the foundations of neo-New Deal progressivism. If the United States is in an existential contest for global power, then boosting taxing and regulations on business is especially ill-advised, as is the neo-Brandeisian campaign to destroy large corporations. As are unrestrained demands from organized labor. Progressive advocates know this quite well, which is why they go to any end to deny that China even is a competitor. [287] The grand strategy of stand and fight, ideally with the support of U.S. allies who hopefully don’t cave and strike their own separate Quisling deals, requires a coherent national power industry strategy. Free-market policy, and even a manufacturing policy, competitiveness policy, and innovation policy—none will get the United States where it needs to be, because, by definition, they are all agnostic to strategic industry capabilities. The problem is that Washington has virtually no experience with a national power industry strategy. There is neither the conceptual framework for how to craft a strategy, the institutional and legal frameworks to enact it, nor the skills in the federal workforce to manage it. The last time Washington tried do something like this was in WWII when the Roosevelt administration, under the leadership of “Big Bill” Knudsen and Henry Kaiser, organized industry into the arsenal of democracy. [288] Knudsen, then the CEO of General Motors, was put in charge of the Office of Production Management. His task was not to spur innovation or even generate more manufacturing, but rather to help American industry transition to build mass amounts of weapons to defeat our enemies. Kaiser, CEO of Kaiser Steel, was tasked with building a flotilla of “liberty ships.” At the same time, the Office of Scientific Research and Development was created to drive scientific and engineering research for military purposes. [289] That task, while daunting, was in many ways easier and more straightforward than today’s. The United States already had the world’s largest and most technologically sophisticated manufacturing sector. And the transition from trucks to tanks and passenger planes to bomber planes was not as complicated as it would be today, given the advanced technology involved in today’s weapons systems. And the focus was somewhat narrow: produce a massive amount of a relatively small variety of weapons. Today’s task is much harder. The United States has already lost significant manufacturing capabilities, and its “industrial commons” is hollower than it should be. And the focus must be much broader than just weapons systems, to include dual-use industries. That suggests that any effort needs to be guided by strategic analysis, not just throwing a jumble of disconnected policies and programs at the problem. The problem is that Washington has virtually no experience with a national power industry strategy. There is neither the conceptual framework for how to craft a strategy, the institutional and legal frameworks to enact it, nor the skills in the federal workforce to manage it. Where to start? Fortunately, the concept and theory of strategy have been formulated in business. Business schools have long had courses in strategy, and the number of books and articles published on the topic are legion. Business strategy is a much more valuable intellectual vein to mine compared with economics because, in contrast to the latter, which sees transactions as utility maximizing for both parties, business strategy sees competition as win-lose, exactly the dynamics between the United States and China. In addition, economics is largely based on theories, models, and equations and assumes that the real world fits the models—and when it doesn’t, economists complain about the world, not the models. And at the same time, the field of international affairs largely overlooks business competition, industry structure, and technology innovation. For both fields, the concept of technology is limited to things that are broadly familiar, such as AI and cybersecurity. Neither consider things such as catalysis, computer numerical control processes (CNC), or combustion engineering. And both assume, as Robert Solow did, that technology emerges out of nowhere, like manna from heaven. So, they don’t even contemplate the possibility of defeat. Rather, they assume there might be shocks that harm some blue collar workers, which is to be lamented and addressed with career training and free bus tickets to help them move out of their loser communities to the coasts, where they can aspire to become two-earner professional couples in more lucrative service industries. Business strategy can’t afford this luxury. It has to be based on ground truth reality, or as close as strategists can get to, because the costs of being wrong are usually obvious, immediate, and painful. A business strategy consultant, or a firm implementing business strategy that has the wrong strategic formulation, will soon be out of business. In contrast, economists are seldom if ever punished for being wrong. Just think that, in 2007, most economists, including Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and economists at the NY and Boston Fed and International Monetary Fund, said a nationwide housing price collapse was virtually impossible. It is hard to think of a single one that suffered professionally from this flawed ideologically based advice. Finally, good business strategy is based on a deep understanding of competitors, one’s own organizational capabilities, and threats and opportunities in the current and emergent environment. This kind of thinking is completely absent in economics, but it is central to national power industry competition. As such, it’s worth reviewing corporate strategy literature and then discussing how it can be applied to national power industry strategy. The godfather of corporate strategy, Harvard Business School’s Michael Porter, wrote: The essence of strategy formulation is coping with competition... Whatever their collective strength, the corporate strategists’ goal is to find position in the industry where his or her company can best defend itself against those forces or can influence them in its favor… Rivalry among existing competitors takes the familiar form of jockeying for position, product introduction, and advertising slugfests. [290] He went on to note, “Once the corporate strategist has assessed the forces affecting competition in his industry and their underlying causes, he can identify his company’s strengths and weaknesses.” [291] Strategy is always in the service of goals. And organizations and nations can have strategies or not. But what often passes for strategy in government is policy. Policy for nations is an amalgam of different government actions (e.g., different tax provisions, spending on a particular area, a specific regulation). If these are oriented toward a common goal, they can be described as a comprehensive policy for “x” (climate, innovation, equity, etc.). But policy is not strategy. Strategy is the use of policies to achieve particular outcomes that take into account the overall internal and external environment. What should be the goal of national economic strategy? That is the single most important question and the one that must be answered first and gotten right. Organizations have an easier time agreeing on a goal. For most companies, the goal is maximizing profits—ideally net present value profits. Not only do nations seek to achieve many goals, but also the process of deciding on these goals, at least in democracies, is messy to say the least. When it comes to economic goals, for the last half century or so, the United States has not been able to come close to agreeing on an overarching one. Some on the Right put freedom from government as the paramount goal, with the belief that this will solve any and all economic problems. But as noted previously, there is no logical reason why a laissez-faire policy would lead to a strong competitive position in national power industries that the United States must be strong at to compete with China. Free-market advocates either deny that the U.S. needs industrial capabilities in key industries or simply assert that this is the role for defense spending. Policy is not strategy. Strategy is the use of policies to achieve particular outcomes that take into account the overall internal and external environment. The problem with the latter approach is twofold. First, defense capabilities increasingly rely on commercial capabilities, and what use to be mostly spin-off (defense innovations being used by the commercial sector) are now more spin-on (commercial innovations being used by defense). [292] This is one reason for the creation of organizations such as In-Qtel, the Defense Innovation Unit, and DOD’s Office of Strategic Capital. Second, even if DOD could create its own self-sufficient and technologically advanced ecosystem, with rest of the economy being law firms, personal service firms, and retail, the costs would be enormous. For example, commercial semiconductor manufacturing relies on mass production to achieve economies of scale and drive down costs. A defense-only model would forego these benefits, leading to vastly higher prices per chip. Moreover, with no commercial partner to share the cost, DOD would have to bear the full expense of developing custom technologies for its unique security, performance, and radiation-hardening needs. While the free-market hold on Washington thinking has lessened in the last decade especially, it’s possible that replacement doctrines, while better, all suffer from systematic limitations for being guides to a national power industry strategy. This is true even for the new manufacturing reshoring doctrine, that many on the Right and the Left have embraced. In this doctrine, restoring manufacturing is the overarching economic goal. In this narrative, the goal should be to restore the working class to its prior position and advocates to see the way to do this by boosting manufacturing, regardless of sector. But even if the United States grew manufacturing so much that it eliminated its manufacturing trade deficit, the number of blue-collar jobs that would be created would be modest at best, less than 2 percent of the U.S. workforce. [293] And like the free-market doctrine, there is no logical reason why a manufacturing doctrine would lead to a strong competitive position in the national power industries the United States must be strong in to not lose to China. It might very well grow consumer sectors such as furniture and plastics, but not power sectors such as aerospace and biotech. The same problems exist with those that embrace the competitiveness and innovation policy doctrines. These doctrines rightly want government to do more to spur competitiveness, especially of advanced sectors and technological innovation broadly. And certainly, more of both would be better and would contribute to boosting U.S. power. But again, there is no reason why generic competitiveness and innovation strategies (e.g., more STEM immigration, a stronger R&D tax credit, more federal support for science) would necessarily preserve critically needed national power industries. The same is true for the new fashionable “Abundance” and “Progress” movements. [294] These movements rightly argue that America needs to once again embrace progress and risk taking, and that we need to significantly reduce the barriers to building things. They want to “shape the progress movement into a cultural force.” [295] But while certainly useful and needed, to think that fewer regulations, a bit more policy risk taking, and more general optimism of the future is enough to not lose the national power industry war is to not understand the nature of the challenge. [296] Competitiveness policy is indifferent to particular industries and therefore there is no need to conduct strategic industry strategy. Finally, there are those who are indifferent to industrial development and have an anticapitalist, neo-New Deal doctrine. The Democratic Left is increasingly focused on economic, social, and demographic equity and the fight against the privileged classes. To the extent it has an industrial strategy, it is for human services industries such as day care and elder care. In addition, much of the Left’s support for industrial policy is actually climate policy, such as supporting the Inflation Reduction Act to spur the building of factories producing renewable energy technologies. But for the most part, with the exception of motor vehicles, these sectors are not strategic in relation to China. For example, if China cut off exports of solar panels, the effect would not be felt immediately and other electricity generation technologies, such as natural gas turbines, could be used. That leaves national power industry strategy. [297] It is a subset of competitiveness policy, but differs in one critical way. Competitiveness policy is indifferent to particular industries and therefore there is no need to conduct strategic industry strategy. But before delving into national power industry strategy, it’s worth examining competitiveness strategy and its limitations. Figure 6: Relationship between competitiveness strategy and national power industry strategy It would seem that competitiveness policy should be the replacement doctrine to neoclassical consumer welfare-focused economics. But while it is closer to the solution we need than consumer-welfare economics or neo-New Deal economics is, it cannot be the guide for the simple reason that it does not prioritize defending key industries. Competitiveness policy is much broader, relating to a more robust competitive trade position for U.S. companies—like how manufacturing policy is indifferent to strategic sectors, competitiveness policy is even more indifferent, as it is agnostic whether the United States is competitive in goods or services. When it comes to national competitiveness strategy the bible remains Michael Porter’s The Competitive Advantage of Nations , published in 1990. The book was a major contribution to the debate at the time, and it remains highly influential for how competitiveness experts and politicians think about the issue. Because of that, it is worth examining what Porter got right and what he got wrong, especially for today’s China era. Porter got much right. First, he rightly pointed out that national prosperity is created, not inherited, a direct challenge to much of international trade theory at the time, which still believed in comparative, rather than competitive advantage. Second, Porter pointed out that competitive advantage is something governments should strive for—yet is something most U.S. economists still question. Third, he stressed the importance of innovation in creating competitive advantage. Fourth, he built theories of competitive advantage up from the experience of industries, not down from broad macro conditions. This is critical because almost all that passes for competitiveness or industrial policy today ignores industry analytics. As Porter wrote, “The particular industry—passenger cars, facsimile machines, accounting services, ball bearings—is where competitive advantage of firms is either won or lost.” [298] He went on to note that “firms play a central role in the process of creating competitive advantage.” [299] This is why he wrote that his theory drew on several fields, including of course the business literature of competitive strategy, but also fields of “technological innovation, industrial economics, economic development, economic geography, international trade, political science, and industrial sociology.” [300] Note that he did not include macro- and micro-economics, the disciplines that dominate economic policy thinking in the United States. The fields Porter drew from are largely ignored in Washington in favor a sterile and model-based abstract economics. Fifth, he brought in the critical field of strategy, writing that “a new theory must reflect a rich conception of competition that includes segmented markets, differentiated products, technological differences and economies of scale … and process innovation.” [301] Despite Porter’s contribution, these insights have had virtually no impact in Washington, where sectoral level analysis and strategy largely do not exist and where macro-economists and finance experts run economic policy. Sixth, Porter demonstrated the importance of dynamic, not static, competition—something that today’s economic theory, including antitrust, too often misses. As he wrote, “In actual competition, the essential character is innovation and change. Instead of being limited to passively shifting resources to where the returns are the greatest, the real issue is how firms increase the returns available through new products and processes.” [302] Seventh, he recognized a role for government, something most economists deny or minimize. But as discussed ahead, Porter significantly underestimated that role, as almost all corporate strategists still do. Much of what Porter wrote represents an important contribution to the understanding of national competitiveness. But Porter’s thinking, and the thinking of other experts and organizations who have adopted the conventional Porter-inspired competitiveness framework, contains fatal flaws that make policy recommendations stemming from it be inadequate at best, and harmful at worst. His cardinal intellectual sin was that he wrongly argued that “the only meaningful concept of competitiveness at the national level is national productivity.” [303] At one level, it’s surprising that someone of his stature could make such a fundamental error of logic as this, but few scholars can escape their intellectual background when delving into adjacent fields, and his background was in how firms boost their profits (e.g., productivity). Others have followed his framing. WEF’s Global Competitiveness Report defines competitiveness as “the set of institutions, policies, and factors that determine the level of productivity of a country.” [304] And IMD’s World Competitiveness Yearbook defines competitiveness similarly, but more broadly, as how an “economy manages the totality of its resources and competencies to increase the prosperity of its population.” [305] But while these two terms are related, competitiveness should not be equated with productivity or GDP growth. To see why, it’s important to differentiate between traded and nontraded industries. A traded industry is one in which the firms sell a significant share of their output outside a particular geographical area. For example, a printing firm in Michigan that sells printed material to customers across the United States would be a traded firm from the perspective of the Michigan economy, but a nontraded firm from the perspective of the U.S. economy. In contrast, a software firm in Washington that sells software throughout the world would be a traded firm from the state and national perspective. Porter’s thinking contains fatal flaws that make policy recommendations stemming from it be inadequate at best, and harmful at worst. Thus, competitiveness relates only to the economic health of a region’s or nation’s traded sectors. (For the purpose of this memo, the term “region” shall refer to both national and subnational economies) But how do we define health? One definition is jobs. But this can’t be right, because if one region’s traded sector is highly productive, it will have fewer jobs than another region’s traded sector that is less productive, yet it may be more competitive. Another definition is value added—the amount of value that traded sector firms add to the inputs of production that they purchase. This is closer to the right definition, but it fails to control for the extent to which a region’s economy is traded. One region’s economy might be more traded than another’s and therefore its traded sector is larger, but it might have vastly more imports, meaning that its traded sector is not holding its own when it comes to competitiveness. But even this is not quite precise enough, for one region might run a trade surplus but do so by subsidizing its exporters (e.g., by manipulating its currency) or erecting barriers to importers (e.g., tariffs). In this case, the trade surplus may not be a reflection of the true competitiveness of the region’s traded sector firms, but rather a reflection of the extent of mercantilist aid the traded sector firms receive. This sets up the true definition: competitiveness is the ability of an economy to export more in value-added terms than it imports, while accounting for the “terms of trade” to reflect all government “discounts” (including an artificially low currency, suppressed wages in export sectors, artificially low taxes on traded sector firms, and direct subsidies to exports), as well as foreign barriers to its exports (both tariff and nontariff). Under this definition, a nation may run a large trade surplus (one component of competitiveness), but if it does so by providing large “discounts” to its exporters or by blocking imports, it would not be truly competitive, for such policies would reduce its terms of trade by requiring its residents to give up some of their income to foreign consumers, pay higher prices for foreign goods and services, or both. We can see this by looking at past trends in the U.S. trade deficit. When the rise in the relative price of imports brought about through the lower value of the dollar in the last half of the 1980s helped reduce the U.S. trade deficit, it also reduced the U.S. terms of trade (the United States could buy fewer imports for the same quantity of exports). Therefore, U.S. competitiveness was unchanged even as the trade deficit declined. Likewise, the fact that the United States runs a massive trade deficit today but many of its trading partners run surpluses by means of massive “discounting” (including currency manipulation) and import blocking means that we cannot determine with certainty that the U.S. economy is uncompetitive. In fact, despite numerous studies claiming to compare national competitiveness, no study to date has actually done this because none has fully accounted for the magnitude of export discounting and import blocking, in part because the data is extremely difficult to collect. While data exists on trade balances for virtually all nations, data on the extent of export discounts and import blocking (especially through nontariff barriers) is difficult to obtain. Despite this, at a cursory level, it would appear that nations such as Austria, Germany, and Sweden would be on a list of competitive economies (they run trade surpluses while also having relatively high wages and limited other discounts). In contrast, nations such as China (too much discounting) and the United States (too large a trade deficit even when accounting for foreign subsidies) would likely not make the list of competitive economies. How does productivity fit into competitiveness? Productivity can enable competitiveness, especially if it is concentrated in traded sectors, which lowers costs and enables firms to sell more in global markets without relying on government-provided discounts. But productivity growth can also be relatively unrelated to competitiveness if it is concentrated in nontraded sectors. Imagine a nation with strong productivity growth but almost all of it in nontraded sectors such as grocery stores, electric utilities, and nursing homes. Certainly, incomes would go up as relative prices in these sectors fell, but firms in traded sectors would only see modest reductions in their costs based on the extent of purchased inputs from nontraded firms. The United States could very well be much stronger internationally with no trade deficit and no diminution of the value of the dollar and still see key industries beaten and destroyed by China. Porter recognized that “to firms, competitiveness meant the ability to compete in world markets.” [306] Although he should have added the caveat that this only matters for firms in traded industries, not domestic serving industries. But he can’t go to the next logical step of saying that to nations, competitiveness meant the ability to compete in world markets. Presumably, this is because he worried that it would empower protectionists who cared about deindustrialization. But in fact, countries do compete, as we will see ahead regarding China. But even this true definition of competitiveness still does not address the core existential challenge facing the United States: predation by China for strategic industries. The United States could very well be much stronger internationally with no trade deficit and no diminution of the value of the dollar and still see key industries beaten and destroyed by China. It could boost exports in tourism, banking, consulting, higher education, natural resources, food products, plastics, and furniture but lose is aerospace, machinery, biotech, semiconductors, and other advanced industries to China. Before discussing the concept and importance of strategic national power industries, it’s important to consider the other major problems in Porter’s work, because so many people continue to rely on the Porter framework even though it no longer applies to the world the United States finds itself in today. A Focus on Democratic Nations: First, Porter analyzed democratic, capitalist nations; not China. As such, he made two key assumptions. One was that other countries would generally play by the rules. And two was that it was okay if U.S. firms disinvested in certain industries. It didn’t matter if other nations won in certain industries, as long as the United States’ firms generally invested in areas they had competitive advantage in. In fact, Porter did not even mention China in his book. The assumptions he made about the competitive environment of firms in the United States or any of the countries he advised simply do not hold when it comes to China. Porter was writing about capitalism, not state capitalism. And state capitalism changes everything. Among other items, he assumed that 1) foreign firms would not engage in systematic dumping; 2) nations would not be able to afford massive subsidies to targeted industries; 3) to the extent they did dump or subsidize, national trade policies would effectively respond to such policies; and 4) foreign markets would generally be open to imports, and if they were not, negotiations would pry them open. Of course, none of that applies to Chinese state capitalism. Porter went on to claim that “subsidies of any kind will have little leverage when competition is based on quality, rapid product development, and advanced features.” [307] But what about when the competitor has pretty good quality, fairly rapid product development, and many advanced features but on top of that has massive subsidies from the government? This describes many Chinese firms. Then those subsidies provide massive leverage. Moreover, in many markets, particularly middle-income countries, price matters more and buyers are willing to buy Chinese goods that are not quite as good as American because of the strong price advantage. Porter ignores this because he couldn’t conceive of what China became and didn’t anticipate the strong growth of global GDP in developing markets. Porter was writing about capitalism, not state capitalism. And state capitalism changes everything. To the extent Porter envisioned tough price competition, his advice was that firms downsize and even exit, because competing on price is a fool’s errand. And he applied this advice to governments to give up on industries that they couldn’t easily compete in because of price, even if most of the price differential was due to unfair government practices. Porter also wrote that companies, and nations by extension, should give short shrift to unfair foreign trade practices. For Porter, this just opened up rent seeking that ultimately kept firms from evolving. In fact, he noted unfair trade practices with italics (“unfair”) to suggest that they really are not unfair. He argued that firms and governments pushing pack against foreign unfair trade practices “postpone change, dampen innovation … and work in exactly the wrong direction from those necessary for competitive advantage.” [308] This is clearly wrong. If it’s true, why not encourage other nations to ramp up unfair advantages, as doing so would really motivate U.S. firms to compete. But if the unfairness is actually a Colt 45 to the head, as it is with China, it won’t motivate, it will decimate. Porter also applied the same corollary to domestic policy, when he wrote, “Direct government ‘assistance’ [again note the quotation marks to imply that it is not actually assisting] in one firm or industry also has a strong tendency to create forces that cause it to spread and multiply.” [309] He was writing as if assistance were highly contagious and a deadly communicable disease and not a key factor to respond to Chinese power industry predation. Related to this, and reflecting his firm orientation, Porter repeatedly rejected the idea that nations should seek to address systematic cost disadvantages, in fact, bizarrely saying that these are good, as they spur firms to compete and innovate more. Perhaps, but not when the cost differentials are large and persistent as they are vis-à-vis the United States and China. Perhaps betraying his lack of understanding of international economics Porter did not appear to ever consider that currency is the natural market adjustment mechanism in international trade except that it doesn’t work for the United States because the dollar is the reserve currency. A Limited Role for Government: Second, Porter only saw a limited role for government in boosting firm or industry competitiveness. The role of government “is inevitably partial.” [310] When a nation’s companies are competing against companies from other nations that generally play by the rules, perhaps this framing is correct. Although Porter largely ignored the key role the USG played in the development of many industries, including shipbuilding, aerospace, semiconductors, and interchangeable parts. But again, in a world where China practices techno-economic predation, such a limited role is by definition a death sentence for domestic industry that China targets. He applied his famous Porter diamond of five forces that affect firm competitiveness to national policy. These were threat of new entrants, bargaining power of suppliers, bargaining power of buyers, threat of substitute products or services, and in the middle, rivalry among existing competitors. For countries, he listed four: national factor conditions, firm strategy, structure and rivalry, related and supporting industries, and demand conditions. But this reflects his overarching ideology of limited government, a blind spot most business strategists suffer from. Sure, government can build some roads and fund some R&D and put in place some regulations. But under no circumstances should it be involved in industry strategy. Porter’s theory allowed firm exit from markets, and in fact actively supported it. But countries cannot allow power industry exit unless they want less power. He made assumptions that at least in the case of China are not true as when he said that “even when staffed with the most elite civil servants, governments make erratic decisions about the industry to develop, the technologies to invest in, and the competitive advantages that will be the most appropriate and achievable.” [311] Yet, he assumed that leaving these choices to a nation’s firms would maximize competitiveness: which Porter meant as productivity. Porter opposed governments targeting particular industries because “targeting distorts market signals by altering the incentives of private firms to compete in an industry.” [312] He wrote that when government distorts market signals, especially through direct targeting, it cannot rely on firms to invest only in fundamentally sound industries. It places the burden on government planners to understand the subtle conditions for national advantage.” [313] He went on to complain that “one nation after another crowds into the same industries,” creating overcapacity. [314] Perhaps in a pre-China world this might have some basis, but not now. When China targets U.S. firms with attacks, fundamentally distorting market forces, not responding distorts market forces. Nations Can Choose Any Industry: Porter’s third error was that he treated industry choice the way companies treated it. Profit-making companies are indifferent about the industry they are in, as long as they maximize profits. So should nations be, said Porter, writing, “Manufacturing is not ‘better’ than services … because many services involve sophisticated technology and high levels of productivity.” [315] If the goal is productivity, Porter was correct. Whatever set of industries maximize productivity are the best ones. But if the goal is competitiveness, and in particular power industry competitiveness, then nations cannot be indifferent about which industries they are strong in. Porter’s theory allowed firm exit from markets, and in fact actively supported it. But countries cannot allow power industry exit unless they want less power. Cost Competition Is Not Key: Fourth, Porter rejected cost competition. Like almost all strategy gurus, he advised firms to not engage in slugging it out in price competition because doing so eroded margins. Better to find ways to move up the value chain or seek niches that maintain margins. If that doesn’t work, then shrink. But that clearly cannot be the answer for strategic industries. The United States does not have the luxury of getting out of industries such as semiconductors and aerospace even if China attacks the margins. He wrote that a “10 percent cost saving through economies of scale … is nullified quickly by rapid product and process improvement.” [316] But in a hyper-competitive environment with China, where it will have the former and the latter, not pursuing the former is a recipe for market share loss. Porter’s third error was that he treated industry choice the way companies treated it. Profit-making companies are indifferent about the industry they are in, as long as they maximize profits. So should nations be. Top-Line Growth Is Key: Fifth, Porter reflected the common view in the business strategy literature that the best strategy is to go for top-line growth in new markets, rather than slugging it out with other firms in existing markets. He wrote, “The most sustainable strategies are those that widen and upgrade the market rather than simply taking business away from foreign firms.” [317] That might be a good strategy for firms that have no fundamental responsibility for maintaining production of power goods. But it is a defeating strategy for nations. Firms Must Choose Between Cost and Differentiation: His sixth error was in assuming that firms had a fundamental choice in industry positioning between lower cost and differentiation. This was common business strategy advice at the time. As David Moshella argued: In 1995, Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema argued that companies could excel in one of three areas— product leadership (PL), operational efficiency (OE), or customer intimacy (CI) 7 . Strategically, they needed to choose which discipline to focus on, and then be competitive in the other two. This thinking made great sense in the pre-digital age—with Sony (PL), McDonald’s (OE), and the Ritz-Carlton (CI) serving as iconic examples of each approach. But the digital leaders shown in the figure typically excel in all three dimensions. For example, Amazon and Netflix have the widest product selection, the most efficient operations, and the most personalized customer experience in their respective markets. [318] That was certainly true when he wrote the book Seeing Digital: A Visual Guide to the Industries, Organizations, and Careers of the 2020s . [319] But the emergence of digital technologies has made that much less true. Digital-first companies can now achieve low costs, high quality, and differentiation. That means the safety niche of moving upscale to differentiation is less safe from attack. One key aspect of Porter’s work (and others in the field) is the idea of bad competitors. For anyone who plays poker, a bad player is someone who is so bad they don’t know when the opponent is making a great bluff and hence stay in and win. In the case of bad competitors, Porter argues they have several characteristics. First, they are aggressive price cutters even if doing so hurts their long-term profitability and overall industry profitability. Second, they are low-differentiation players that offer similar products with little or no differentiation, making it difficult for any firm to establish a sustainable competitive advantage. Third, they are unstable participants that enter an industry with aggressive tactics and limited resources, potentially destabilizing the market. And finally, they are high-stakes competitors that are heavily invested in an industry and will fight aggressively to maintain their position, even during downturns. These factors largely describe Chinese competitors that, for the most part, are bad competitors employing almost militaristic, scorched-earth policies. They aggressively cut prices, not worrying about year after year of losses, usually backed up by Chinese government deep pockets. This China price—aggressive pricing—destroys gross margins industry-wide. Second, they specialize in copycat products. Third, they aggressively enter new industries such as biotech, aerospace, and high-speed rail where they have little experience and ultimately completely destabilizing markets, in part because they end up closing their own markets to competition. And finally, they don’t blink in either economy- or industry-wide downturns; they keep investing and expanding, leading to global overcapacity. U.S. and allied nations must prepare for a decades-long siege wherein a share of national income will have to be devoted to shoring up power industries in order to endure grueling trench warfare. When it comes to dealing with such competitors in normal countries, Porter proposed three possible strategies. First, abandon the industry. If the industry is structurally unattractive due to bad competitors and offers limited profit potential, a company might choose to exit the market and pursue opportunities elsewhere. Or it might abandon the United States and seek to match the artificial China price by moving production to China, or more recently, to even lower-cost locations such as India. Or it might go “asset-light” and outsource capital-intensive, lower-margin shares of the business to other companies, including companies outside the United States. In these situations, it makes little economic sense to invest, which is why so many companies return free cash to shareholders through stock buybacks. But this is temporary strategy at best. Moreover, both strategies hollow out domestic industrial capacity: strategy 1 directly reduces the manufacturing base, while Strategy 2 degrades supplier ecosystems and workforce capabilities. The result is a self-reinforcing cycle wherein American firms lose the ability to scale innovation and compete in advanced manufacturing, validating Andy Grove’s 2010 warning about the strategic risks of abandoning production competencies. [320] While this might be useful for the company in the short run, eventually, the company will have few places to run. And more importantly, abandonment is not a choice that countries seeking to maintain national techno-economic power can make. Second, convert bad competitors. Porter says that a c ompany might try to influence or educate bad competitors to adopt more sustainable competitive practices, such as focusing on differentiation or value-added services. Perhaps this might work with a normal company in a normal government, but it absolutely will not work with China. For at least two decades, U.S. policymakers thought that if they just engaged in enough dialogue, they could show the CCP the error of its ways and that it would start to compete fairly. Needless to say, that proved to be false. If neither of these two steps is possible, Porter advised preparing for a siege . In t his case, the company needs to adopt a long-term strategy focused on cost leadership or differentiation while enduring intense competition and potentially lower profits. That is what U.S. and allied nations must do: prepare for a decades-long siege wherein a share of national income will have to be devoted to shoring up power industries in order to endure grueling trench warfare. America needs a national power industry strategy. Conventional consumer-welfare economics won’t cut it, nor will progressive neo-New Dealism. Competitiveness, innovation, and manufacturing policy, while closer, all fall short of the mark. While there was considerable excellent work done on competitiveness policy, including by scholars such as John Zysman, Laura Tyson, Robert Hayes, Lester Thurow, Michael Piorre, James Womack, Annalee Saxenian, Ira Magaziner, and others in the 1980s and 1990s, that work did not have to focus on national power industries because our core competitors—particularly Japan and Germany—were allies. [321] Finally, new concepts such as the “abundance movement,” at best address only small parts of the challenge. For a national power industry strategy, the first issue is to identify which industries (products in business strategy terms) to compete for. And the second is development of an action plan based on an amalgam of deep industry analyses. What to do? Unfortunately, in part because the United States has never faced this kind of challenge before, there is little intellectual work on which to build. As discussed, the closest is the field of business strategy. We need to look at this field, not for cookie cutter answers, but rather for inspiration and ideas that can be built upon to construct a national power industry strategy framework. What is business strategy? It is not culture. It is not operational excellence. It is not planning and policy. Rather, strategy is about positioning and reacting. As strategy guru Roger Martin has written: Planning and strategy are two fundamentally different actions—and conflating them undermines performance. Planning is about allocating resources and setting out actions within a company’s control, like opening a new plant or hiring staff. Strategy, on the other hand, is about making a coherent set of choices that position an organization to win in a specific market. [322] One business strategy article argues that a business strategy has two core elements: The first is the product-market investment decision which includes the product-market scope of the business strategy, its investment intensity and the resource allocation in a multiple business context. The alternatives range from a withdrawal from a business area to a milking strategy to various growth strategies such as market share growth, or expansion of the product line or served market. The second core element is the development of a sustainable competitive advantage which encompasses underlying distinctive competences or assets, appropriate objectives, functional area policies, and the creation of synergy. A sustainable competitive advantage is usually based upon a strong point of differentiation such as product quality, a sustainable cost advantage, or a focus upon one or more market segments. [323] In other words, for a national power industry strategy, the first issue is to identify which industries (products in business strategy terms) to compete for. And the second is development of an action plan based on an amalgam of deep industry analyses. Business strategy is a much more effective source of information for a national power industry strategy than conventional dominant consumer welfare economics. First, unlike consumer welfare economics, which assumes in the Ricardian framework that trade is win-win, business strategy sees competition as mostly win-lose, with market share gains of one company coming at the expense of a competitor. And that is exactly what the U.S.-China techno-economic and trade relationship is. The PricewaterhouseCoopers journal Strategy and Business wrote: The concept of strategy originates in war, where the objective is to destroy the enemy. In business, if the enemy is your competitor, then the objective of strategy must be to crush the competition. Michael Porter gave academic standing to this way of thinking when he made popular the idea of “competitive advantage” with his best-selling textbook, Competitive Strategy , published in 1980. [324] One leading strategy book from 1986, Marketing Warfare, notes that it : applies military strategic principles to business competition, outlining four primary competitive strategies: defensive warfare (for market leaders), offensive warfare (for strong challengers), flanking attacks (for smaller players finding undefended market segments), and guerrilla warfare (for small companies using focused, limited attacks). [325] Second, unlike consumer welfare economics, which assumes that all industries are similar (they all compete on demand and supply), business strategy also is grounded in recognition that industries (and technologies) are fundamentally different, and require different strategies. And that matters when competing with China because winning in biopharmaceuticals requires a very different kind of strategy than competing in quantum computing. Third, unlike consumer welfare economics, business strategy largely sees firm inputs as undifferentiated commodities firms can buy in markets. Business strategy recognizes the many different factors that go into a firm being able to win competitive challenges, including taxes. This is key because winning (or at least not losing) in various national power industries requires understanding that each requires unique inputs and policies. The concepts in business strategy are vastly richer than economics, wherein everything boils down to supply and demand, profit and loss, and allocation efficiency. Finally, unlike consumer welfare economics, which assumes that national economies tend toward a state of equilibrium, business strategy, especially work after the late 1990s, assumes a constant dynamic process. And also unlike consumer welfare economics, which assumes that innovation is constant, essentially “manna from heaven,” business strategy sees it as intentional. UC Berkely professor David Teece wrote: Dynamic capability is “the firm’s ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments.” Dynamic capabilities can be distinguished from operational or “ordinary” capabilities, which pertain to the current operations of an organization. Dynamic capabilities, by contrast, refer to “the capacity of an organization to purposefully create, extend, or modify its resource base.” [326] As one article notes, “Competitive dynamics refer to a series of attacks and counterattacks launched by companies operating in a particular market to strengthen their competitive positions, where strategic actions by one firm often trigger reactions from rival firms.” [327] The concepts in business strategy are vastly richer than economics, wherein everything boils down to supply and demand, profit and loss, and allocation efficiency. In other words, if you would have one discipline to shape national techno-economic and trade policy, economists or business scholars we would be better off with the latter. While certain sub-disciplines of economics such as industrial organization and regional economics address some of these concepts, by and large, consumer welfare economics glosses over them. These concepts include the following: ▪ Choices of technology leapfrogging ▪ Overcoming latecomer disadvantages ▪ Role of market share building ▪ Fixed costs and variable costs and impacts on marginal costs ▪ Economies of scope and scale ▪ Importance of execution vs. strategy ▪ Sources of competitive advantage (price, quality, customization, innovation) ▪ Incremental vs. disruptive innovation ▪ Organizational culture and resistance to disruptive innovation ▪ Turnaround strategies vs. sustaining ▪ Experience curve and learning curve [328] ▪ Growth-share matrix [329] ▪ Cost advantage vs. differentiation ▪ Barriers to entry ▪ Product life cycle and commodification ▪ Market growth rates ▪ Sustaining vs. disruptive innovation ▪ Industry positioning ▪ Market scope (local, national, global) ▪ Kinds of innovation (product, process, business model) ▪ Kinds of competition (dynamic vs. static) ▪ Industry externalities ▪ Network effects ▪ Agglomeration (localization and urbanization) ▪ First mover vs. latecomer advantages [330] ▪ Threat of entry and barriers to entry ▪ Expected retaliation from incumbent ▪ Substitutability ▪ Modularity These and other business strategy concepts can be incorporated into the shaping of a national power industry strategy and the multitude of sub-industry strategies that must be developed. While the business strategy frame offers a much more promising foundation to build on, there are important ways it does not fully translate for the establishment of a national power industry strategy. First, business strategy is based on indifference to strategic sectors. If Intel can make more money by becoming a fabless chip designer than it can competing with the likes of TSMC to produce chips, by all means it should do this. But that cannot be an acceptable outcome from a power industry strategy because the nation needs leading chipmakers that are headquartered in the United States. Second, business strategy advises firms to not slug it out in markets based on cost competition. Pretty much every business strategy tells business executives to retreat to higher-margin parts of the business. This may or may not be good business advice, but it also might be bad in that it assumes that the cost challenger is consigned to cost competition, not other forms of higher-margin competition such as quality, customization, or brand. But either way, it is poor strategy for a nation seeking to not lose in cost competition because China always starts industry competition with a cost assault—and if U.S. firms fold and run at the first whiff of gunpowder, America will lose power industry capabilities. Besides, Chinese firms have shown that they always intend to move up the value chain and attack the high-margin segments. Going asset-light is usually counter to the goals of a national power industry strategy, which is based on boosting capital assets in country. Third, some of the business strategy literature, and most of the equity market advice, is for firms to maximize return on net assets. A key way to do boost this ratio is to reduce net assets. Companies do this by going asset-light and outsourcing more capital-intensive work to other companies that presumably don’t listen to business consultants. This way, capital can be freed up for other uses, such as stock buybacks. This may or may not be a good strategy to maximize long-term profitability and net-present value returns. But going asset-light is usually counter to the goals of a national power industry strategy, which is based on boosting capital assets in country. As one article notes, “ The tension is often between financial goals, such as cash flow and profit, and strategic goals, such as market position and growth.” [331] For a corporation, the former dominate. For a country, the latter must dominate. Fourth, of course, is that the fundamental goals and operations of an economy are different than that of a firm, and the business strategy literature largely ignores the role of the state. It is instructive that chapter 12 of Porter’s book Competitive Advantage of Nations is not “government strategy” but “government policy.” This is key. The competitiveness community eschews strategy, but without it, we can’t solve for China strategic industry aggression. Box 5: Shih-Paisano Industry Classification Model At the same time, calls for massive reshoring ignore the fact that it makes sense to rely on global supply chains for at least some manufacturing production. One useful framework for thinking about this comes from Harvard Business School professors Gary Pisano and Willy Shih. [332] They have argued that the degree to which it makes sense to offshore production or keep it at home depends on two factors: process maturity (the extent to which the technologies used to produce a product are mature or continuing to evolve) and modularity (the degree to which information about product design can be separated from the manufacturing industry). Their argument is that in industries with high modularity and mature production processes, offshoring in order to lower costs makes good business sense and does not come at the cost of product or process innovation. They put the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in this category; the production process is relatively mature and product innovation (the development of new drugs) is not dependent on close linkages to the production process. This is why a significant share of API production has moved offshore. In contrast, they’ve argued that biotechnology production (the production of large-molecule, living compounds) is not a mature production process and there are closer links between drug development and drug production. This is why a much larger share of biotechnology production is still in the United States. There are at least five main policy implications from this. The first is that, to the extent that policy can spur more drug innovation, especially in large-molecule, biotech drugs, it is more likely that production will be located in the United States. The converse is also true: the more there is a push to replace novel drugs with generics, the more likely that supply will be filled through offshore production. As Shih and Pisano wrote, in sectors developing breakthrough products at the frontiers of science, the major process innovations are evolving rapidly and are critical to product innovation. Later reports in this series will lay out in greater detail a national power industry strategy, including a comprehensive list of actionable policy steps America needs to take. For now, a broad framework follows. As in any conflict, there are two main tactics: strengthening one’s own forces and slowing the advance of the adversary’s forces or even degrading them. The former tactic requires a coherent national strategy to bolster domestic economic power. The latter requires steps to limit the PRC’s advances in national power industries. Both are required to succeed. The PRC’s subsidies and other weapons are so powerful that responding by simply boosting America’s domestic capabilities will not be enough, because for a variety of reasons the United States and core allies will never be able to do enough to counter PRC advantage. To slow Chinese gains, the United States and its core allies need to take actions in four areas: 1) limiting Chinese knowledge acquisition; 2) limiting Chinese imports and investment in U.S. and key allied markets; 3) reducing allied firms’ production in China; and 4) contesting Chinese firms in non-allied markets. Doing all of this will require a host of detailed legislative actions, plus administrative follow-up and enforcement. The PRC’s subsidies and other weapons are so powerful that responding by simply boosting America’s domestic capabilities will not be enough. Meanwhile, spurring U.S. and allied gains also will require action in four main areas. First, allied nations need to invest much more in the foundations of technology-based competitiveness, including R&D and skills development in science, technology, and engineering. And these initiatives will need to be structured and targeted in new ways for national power industries, working closely with industry leaders and experts. At the same time, a wide range of federal policies and programs need to be scrapped or modernized for the new era—especially environmental regulations, immigration policy, antitrust policy, tax policy, and economic policies pertaining to small businesses and industrial support. Second, it’s time to jettison the entire idea of free trade agreements. The very concept is based on the quasi-utopian idea that all nations are allies and inherently free traders. Alas, the last 15 years have proved that vision is deficient. Rather than free trade agreements, the United States needs to take the lead in forming strategic national power industry partnerships with allies that are willing to stand up against the CCP’s techno-economic aggression. These partnerships would require not only eliminating virtually all trade and investment barriers, but also requiring that each nation commits to limiting Chinese investment in their domestic markets, adopts a robust export-control and outward bound investment-review regime when it comes to China, agrees to share commercial counterintelligence, and engages in close techno-industrial partnerships. The U.S. government needs to craft industry-specific strategies as part of an overarching national power industry strategy. Third, as American capitalism and corporate financing have evolved into a finance-driven system that presses companies to be asset-light and to prioritize short-term returns, U.S. firms’ ability to robustly fight this techno-economic war has declined. They are competing with Chinese firms that are willing to accept zero or negative returns; that receive massive subsidies for capital investment; and that are prepared to slug it out in market competition until capitalist adversaries throw in the towel. While specific techno-industrial development policies are needed, as long as those incentives are in place for Chinese firms, it will be critical for the United States to provide incentives for even the most patriotically minded CEO not to act in ways that will lose the war. That will likely entail thoroughly overhauling the corporate tax code to reduce or eliminate incentives for short-termism, while at the same time putting in place positive incentives for long-term investment, such as a stronger R&D tax credit and an investment tax credit. Fouth, the U.S. government needs to craft industry-specific strategies as part of an overarching national power industry strategy. Industries are all different in terms of their structures, competitive forces, technology needs, and other factors. While generic support policies like the R&D credit, infrastructure, and science investment can help the overall innovation and competitiveness environment, they lack the specificity needed to help firms in the United States compete effectively in global markets. So, we need a national semiconductor strategy, a national biopharma strategy, a national machine tool and robotics strategy, a national aerospace strategy, and more. These strategies would assess industries’ strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in a classic “SWOT” analysis, and examine how a wide array of federal, state, and local policies impact their power and competitiveness. Box 6: National Power Industry Policy vs. Industrial Policy At first glance, it would appear that national power industry strategy and traditional industrial policy (industrial policy designed around U.S. competitiveness, as opposed to industrial policy for social goals such as climate change or social welfare) would be quite similar. They are at the same level, as they both reject consumer-welfare, free-market economics and envision an active role for government in boosting value added output in certain industries. But there is where their similarity ends. Traditional industrial policy advocates stress its benefits for productivity. Oren Cass has stated that industrial policy is needed because the industries it grows “are actually the place where we get a lot of our productivity growth over time.” [333] But that’s no longer true, as manufacturing productivity growth has lagged behind overall economy productivity growth over the last 15 years or so. The pro-industrial policy group Prosperous America has written that industrial policy is “essential to rebuilding U.S. industry and prosperity.” [334] The logic is that industrial policy will boost output in industries with high value added per worker and by definition will reduce output in industries with lower value added per worker (this is an identity because the models and theory have to assume full employment). When a country is early in its development phase, as South Korea was in the 1950s, this moving-up-the-value-chain model can be quite effective. Workers move from lower productivity sectors such as agriculture and textiles to higher productivity sectors such as steel and then semiconductors. But once an economy becomes fully industrialized, the potential gains from such a strategy are quite limited. For example, the Bureau of Economic Analysis ranks the 19 major manufacturing industries by value added per worker, with petroleum and coal products at $836,600 per worker and furniture and related products at just $69,000. Assume that industrial policy boosts the higher value-added sector output and jobs by an average of 30 percent and reduces the lower value-added sector output and jobs by the same (so the economy has the same number of manufacturing jobs), GDP would experience a one-time increase of $230 billion, or about 1 percent of GDP. [335] Even if we assume that the losses are in even lower value-added nonmanufacturing sectors such as retail trade and personal services, the gains would still be quite small, perhaps 2 to 3 percent of GDP. Second, traditional industrial policy is indifferent to industries in terms of their importance to national power. If an industry has high value added (such as tobacco products), it’s a valuable industry, even if it has no impact on national power. In contrast, the goal of national power industry strategy is not to boost national income; it’s to preserve national power, even if that means a lower standard of living because consumers are paying more for products than they would in a world where more of these products were imported. In addition, national power industry strategy is not agnostic toward industry type. These distinctions may seem esoteric—after all, both approaches embrace industrial policy. But in fact, they are key. Adopting the former strategy will have some positive effects on national power industries, but much of those effects may be irrelevant. The latter strategy will focus on national power industries, even if consumers and taxpayers pay a price. Political economy is almost everything. To be sure, articulating the right strategic framing for a national power industry strategy is key. But at the end of the day, what matters is executing and implementing that strategy. For the most part, the USG is lacking implementation capabilities. There are too few people in government with deep understanding of technology, industry, and national industry strategy. And too many government programs are bogged down with too many rules and restrictions to make them fully effective. The characteristics of the U.S. political economy will have a major influence on the extent to which the United States can put in place an effective national power industry strategy. Even if, by miracle, a president were elected who placed the U.S.-China techno-economic war as their top priority and were fully committed to formulating and carrying out a national power industry strategy, the odds of its success would be limited unless there were broad political support for it, or at least the absence of vociferous opposition. With regard to the political economy of a national power industry strategy, the single biggest factor is that the United States no longer has a developmental state. A developmental state works to prioritize industrial and economic development, along with technological innovation, to strengthen a nation’s competitive standing and geopolitical power . In this model, the state plays an active role in fostering specific sectors and capabilities, in contrast to the more hands-off approach of neoliberalism or the more antibusiness, redistribution of neo-New Deal liberalism. We have a developmental state for defense, but nothing else. With regard to the political economy of a national power industry strategy, the single biggest factor is that the United States no longer has a developmental state. What we have is a fight between a capitalist class that wants nothing more than to be left alone and a Left that wants to limit them and redistribute wealth and power. The U.S. political economy is made up of at least five key players: business, labor unions, civil society, universities, and government. And within each group, there are key subgroups. Unfortunately, none of the five groups fully supports a national power industry strategy. Arguably the most incisive analysis of the role of corporations in U.S. economic policy is from U.C. Berkely political science professor David Vogel in his 1979 article “Why Businessmen Distrust Their State: The Political Consciousness of American Corporate Executives.” [336] While Vogel wrote this almost 50 years ago, little has changed. Vogel tried to answer why such a large share of U.S. corporate leaders looked askance at the state and wanted little to do with it, unlike corporate leaders in Europe and rising Asian nations. He wrote: The business community has been remarkably consistent in its opposition to the enactment of any government policies that would centralize economic decision making or strengthen the authority of government over the direction of the business system as a whole. It is only with respect to policies that have their impact on particular firm or industry that its much heralded pragmatism at times comes into play. The criterion by which business evaluates government policy has remained quite firm: does the proposed intervention strengthen or weaken the autonomy of management? [337] This was not, in Vogel’s view just some recent development; it was baked into the evolution of the U.S. economy. He wrote that this: was an element in conservative doctrine throughout the first seventy-five years of the Republic. After the Civil War, however, it became clear that capitalism was now strong enough to get along without more active assistance from government than it already enjoyed. Equally important, it began to appear that in a partnership between government and business the danger of gratuitous political interference was becoming too serious to justify the risk. The idea of a positive relationship between government and economic life thus fell out of favor among those who underwrote the conservative program. [338] It wasn’t that the state per se would be inept of anticorporate, it was that democratic forces, albeit stronger in the United States than in any other nation, would capture the state in ways that would harm business and overall economic development. Again, Vogel wrote, “Indeed, it was the fact that the state was not required to overthrow anticapitalist forces in the United States that leads to the unique view among U.S. business leaders.” Vogel went on: The critical key to understanding why businessmen are more anti-statist than virtually any other major interest in American society lies in the unique role of the state at their institution’s birth. Business—both large and small—developed during a period when the state was relatively weak and small: in the case of virtually all other major national institutions, the state and the political process played a critical role in their formation… Accepting their nation’s most powerful legitimating ideology, they remain concerned that governmental policy will indeed come to reflect popular preferences. Their hostility to both the ideal and the idea of government involvement in the economy is significantly due to their lack of confidence in their ability to dominate the political process. Unlike France, Germany and Japan, we have no tradition of a strong and autocratic state or of a bureaucracy independent of popular pressures. [339] He added: This historical development pattern, doesn’t just shape business leaders’ views toward business, it shapes their self-identity. For despite what Marxists might say, the United States does not have a unified, self-aware capitalist class, it has individual business leaders who see themselves as such for most interactions, every once in a while seeing them as part of a narrow industry, but almost never once as capitalists. [340] Vogel then wrote: The extent to which capitalism has been ideologically unchanged in America—either by an aristocracy or by a socialist working movement—has also inhibited American businessmen from developing a stronger sense of internal unity. A sense of classlessness that pervades American society, cited so frequently by both defenders and critics of America’s unique political tradition, not only made American unions relatively indifferent to socialist ideology; the individualistic ethic that is so critical a component of the liberal tradition also inhibits a sense of solidarity within the bourgeoisie. Nearly one hundred and fifty years ago, de Tocqueville remarked: To tell the truth, though there are rich men, the class of rich men does not exist; for these individuals have no feelings or purposes, no traditions or hopes, in common; there are individuals, therefore, but no definitive class... The rich are not compactly united among themselves.... In their intense and exclusive anxiety to make a fortune, they lose sight of the close connection which exists between the private fortune of each of them and the prosperity of all... The discharge of political duties appears to them to be a troublesome annoyance, which diverts them from their occupations and business ... These people think that they are following the principle of self-interest, but the idea they entertain of that principle is a very rude one; and the better to look after what they call their business, they neglect their chief business, which is to remain their own masters. [341] He quoted one business executive: “We don’t have a business community. Just a bunch of self-interested people.” 53 He further wrote, “American businessmen appear to behave quite rationally toward government when the interests of their firm or industry are at stake, yet their understanding of the American business system remains remarkably shortsighted and provincial: they confuse their role as businessmen with their interests as capitalists.” [342] This unfortunately has gotten worse, not better, since 1979. As Vogel pointed out, because of the nature of capitalist development in the United States, where the state did not have to play a strong role to overthrow feudal interests, U.S. business leaders never adopted a very strong role as “capitalists.” But even so, their understanding of that role and the key importance of it declined significantly after the late 1970s. Before then, many corporate leaders saw themselves as not only as business leaders but also as corporate statesmen. CEOs such as Reg Jones of General Electric, Irving Shapiro of Dupont, Thomas Watson of IBM, David Packard of HP, George Romney of American Motors, and even John Young of HP in the 1980s spent considerable time advancing the interests of the nation, not just their own firms. And unless you are a diehard anticorporate advocate, there is no doubt that this advocacy strengthened America. But that started to die in the late 1970s and 1980s, prompted by the shareholder value movement and the libertarian notions of popular economic figures such as Milton Friedman, who proclaimed that the only purpose of business is to maximize profits. At one level, this is, of course, true. Companies have to make profits, or they cannot stay in business. But if support for the capitalist system and the policies that support it are weakened, then the ability to earn individual profits is lessened. As Wall Street shifted from providing long-term capital for productive investment to a short-term extraction game—led by raiders such as Mike Miliken, Carl Icahn , Nelson Peltz , T. Boone Pickens , and others—CEOs could no longer afford anything but a focus on short-term profits. The capitalist system would have to take care of itself. And it has not. At the same time, corporate norms shifted and so what was once a system that enabled and largely required statesmanship was now one that penalized it. And the rise of intense global competition only contributed to that short-termism and selfish focus. Doug Henwood wrote that “the transaction replaced the relationship—not just on Wall Street but in American business generally.” [343] And it turns out that relationships are critical to the effective functioning and strength of the U.S. economy. At the same time, the decline of the traditional American WASP ruling class, with all its flaws, had the singular advantage of promoting leaders who were civic minded and not only self-interested, and played a key role. Say what you will about this class, it at least had an ethos of service to the nation. We saw this in the motto of private boarding school Groton, the lead training ground for American leadership class before the 1950s: “Cui servire est regnare,” which is conventionally translated as “To serve is to rule.” In other words, service was key. This didn’t mean that these leaders were always right or altruistic. It did mean that there was an expectation to serve and preserve the Republic. Today, WASPs are a timid minority that recognizes itself at its private clubs, but not much more. It’s not just the change in the system, it’s that the U.S. business community has not been able to generate its own leadership. Who are the top few business leaders who represent American business. Elon Musk? Tim Cook? Jamie Diamond? Not really. Even in 1979, Vogel dismissed the effectiveness of leading “peak associations” such as the Business Roundtable and the Council of Foreign Relations. He argued that the closest the capitalist class came to this was from the 1890s to 1920s, particularly with the leadership of Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan. Morgan was said to have told President Theordore Roosvelt during the Northern Securities antitrust case, “If we have done anything wrong, send your man to my man and they can fix it up” reflecting his centrality to U.S. business. [344] Vogel wrote that four factors weakened that: Since the 1920S four developments have markedly reduced the ability of corporate executives to generate their own political leadership: the decline of the dominance of the Morgan financial interests; the reduction in market control of many of the turn-of-the-century monopolies, e.g., Standard Oil, U.S. Steel, International Harvester; the displacement of entrepreneurs by professional managers; and the internationalization of U.S. corporations. The impact of the first two developments is obvious: they significantly decentralized authority within the corporate system, making it less likely that the position of any one firm could provide a point of departure for understanding the needs of business as a whole. Most of the voluminous literature on the separation of ownership and control is concerned with its impact on corporate economic behavior; what has been overlooked is its impact on corporate political consciousness. This is serious: the managerial revolution severely undermined the formation of corporate class consciousness and business solidarity. [345] Their class consciousness and solidarity are now almost completely gone. The state itself will have to have stronger capabilities, of course, deeply informed by industry, but willing to act for U.S. national power, even when business support might be lacking. At the same time, in part because of the overreach of the neoliberal vision (e.g., tax cuts for upper-income Americans and excessive globalization, reduced public investment, and an acceptance of what was once seen as a fringe ideology, libertarianism) what was once a Left that supported the American capitalist system but wanted it tamed and regulated to reduce excesses, is now largely antagonistic to the system. As an example, while Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) will proclaim that she’s pro capitalist, this appears to be mostly a smoke screen to defend her anticorporate positions. All this has two major implications for the development of a national power industry strategy. First, it means that companies, even if they realize the nature of the China challenge, will be hesitant about asking for state help because they do not trust the ability of the state to either not get captured by nonbusiness interests or to effectively implement a developmental program. Such concerns are not unwarranted, as we saw with the politicization of the CHIPS program by the Biden administration and now the Trump administration. But there are policies and program designs that can limit such flaws, such as tax incentives and industry-led programs. Second, it means that there are few voices advancing the overall U.S. business interests, especially as they align with state interests. Few companies have the leeway to think much beyond their own firm’s interests—especially their near-term interests. This is not because the leadership is populated with selfish individuals. It is because they are operating in a financialized capitalist system wherein any behavior other than that will be punished by markets. As such, it means that the state itself will have to have stronger capabilities, of course deeply informed by industry, but willing to act for U.S. national power, even when business support might be lacking. Box 7: From Shareholder Value Capitalism to National Power Capitalism The emergence of the shareholder value movement—the notion that the sole purpose of capitalist enterprises is to maximize profits—is often attributed to a 1970 New York Times Magazine article by economist Milton Friedman, who wrote that the purpose of a business “is to increase its profits.” [346] Radical libertarian Friedman saw anything other than extreme selfishness as socialism: This is the basic reason why the doctrine of “social responsibility” involves the acceptance of the socialist view that political mechanisms, not market mechanisms, are the appropriate way to determine the allocation of scarce resources to alternative uses. [347] Today, the shareholder value movement tolerates no other corporate purpose than producing short-term profits. Yet, from the early 1900s until the 1970s, there was a general view held by corporations that their mission was not just to increase stock price but also to serve other constituencies, including the national interests (something libertarians such as Friedman do not believe exists). Eminent business scholar Peter F. Drucker represented this view in 1952, writing: We believe today, both inside and outside the business world, that the business enterprise, especially the large business enterprise, exists for the sake of the contribution which it makes to the welfare of society as a whole. Our economic-policy discussions are all about what this responsibility involves and how best it can be discharged. There is, in fact, no disagreement, except on the lunatic fringes of the Right and on the Left, that business enterprise is responsible for the optimum utilization of that part of society's always-limited productive resources which are under the control of the enterprise. [348] But beginning in the 1980s, changes in the institutional system of U.S. investing and management, under the rubric of the “shareholder value movement,” changed all that. How investment funds were structured and their managers were rewarded meant that funds moved money around in search of the quickest return, regardless of where long-term value might be found. How managers were compensated—increasingly with stock options that were not always related to actual managerial performance—reflected this new view that a manager’s job was to maximize value for the shareholders. And because managers themselves became key short-term stockholders (through the significant growth of stock options), they made even more effort to enhance the welfare of short-term stockholders, including by boosting dividends and through stock buybacks. Now stock price was all that mattered, and the best way to get that price up was to engage in frenetic bidding wars to get the best CEO and top-level management team, which meant a massive increase in executive compensation. The rise of the shareholder value movement and its later evolution into corporate short-termism, or what some call “quarterly capitalism,” meant that CEOs were rewarded for downsizing firms, limiting investment in capital stock (in order to maximize return on net assets), and paying attention solely to the bottom line. This focus on short-term returns was not rational in the sense of maximizing returns for society, or even for companies (if returns are defined as maximizing the net present value of all future profits). The shareholder value revolution hurt national economic power. Indeed, as companies began paying out more in dividends and engaging in stock buybacks as a way to boost stock prices for short-term investors, relatively less was available for investing in activities that would boost national economic power. With the rise of the shareholder value movement came a shift in the political role and orientation of the corporate community. Prior to the mid-1980s, many CEOs, such as GM’s Charlie Wilson, GE’s Reginald Jones, HP’s John Young, DuPont’s Irving Shapiro, and Loral’s Bernard Schwartz, saw their role not just as CEO but as corporate statesman. But around that time, the role of “business statesman” began to fade. Executives came under increasing pressure to focus ruthlessly on boosting profits and share prices. Those who didn’t risked losing their jobs or seeing their companies swallowed up in hostile takeovers. This is not to say that some of today’s CEOs don’t try to play some broader role, but overall, U.S. corporate leaders have abdicated their roles as statesmen for roles as CEOs alone. In his book, The Fracturing of the Corporate Elite , Mark Mizruchi observed: [After] World War II, American business leaders hewed to an ethic of civic responsibility and enlightened self-interest.… In the 1970s, however, faced with inflation, foreign competition, and growing public criticism, corporate leaders became increasingly confrontational with labor and government. As they succeeded in taming their opponents, business leaders paradoxically undermined their ability to act collectively. [349] A survey by the corporate organization Committee for Economic Development supports this observation, finding that the three biggest barriers to business leaders taking a more active role in public issues were “concern about criticism others have experienced; shareholder pressure for short-term results; and belief that a CEO should focus on his/her company.” [350] For the CEOs, it became a collective action problem. Why step up and fight for big business and the U.S. economy generally when it only means taking valuable time away from your company? As a thought experiment, try to name a current CEO who is seen as a leader for good policy for the American economy. Today, the lunatic fringes of the Right and Left are no longer fringes. The Right embraces Friedman’s shareholder value movement. Today’s Left, at best, talks about stakeholder capitalism (e.g., helping workers, the environment, and other interests). Some, such as radical globalist Klaus Scwab, even argue that the key stakeholder should be the entire global proletariat and environment. [351] Others, including many on the progressive Left, would have companies completely do away with a focus on profits, while others would wrap corporations up in a Gulliver-like straitjacket. [352] But even mainstream thinking has missed the point. The Business Roundtable says that the best companies “put the customer first and invest in their employees and communities” and supporting their suppliers. [353] For many, shareholder capitalism is following an alphabet soup of ESG (environment, social, and governance) goals. Absent is any discussion of the needs of the nation as a whole. What is needed is an alternative to shareholder capitalism that is not stakeholder capitalism. We need national power capitalism. In this framework, companies don’t ignore profit, but they work wherever possible to align that with U.S. and allied techno-economic and trade power. And they certainly do not oppose, and ideally support, national government policies to encourage the alignment of companies and the national interest. Just as corporations used to think of themselves as defenders of the system, so did organized labor. Of course, this was before labor unions were significantly weakened and now largely represent government workers, some low-pay service workers, and certain construction trades. Like corporations, unions focus largely on their own interests, in this case, demanding higher wages and benefits and resisting automation. A 2023 United Auto Workers strike led the Big Three U.S. automakers to grant workers at least 27 percent wage increases. [354] The Writers Guild strike resulted in studios agreeing to limit the use of AI to automate creative work. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace struck for a 40 percent wage increase and a restoration of defined-benefit retirement plans. The question few are asking is what the effect will be on the global competitiveness of these companies, and by extension the U.S. economy. It’s one thing for a teachers’ union to demand higher wages; the only result would be higher taxes. But in industries that are globally traded, overly aggressive union demands often put firms at a competitive disadvantage—helping current union members in the short term, but hurting the firms, future workers, and the national economy in the long term as the firms become less competitive in global markets. We have the role of unions in leading to industrial decline in the United Kingdom, as all their incentives have been to maximize short-term gains at the expense of long-term stability. Even if unions realized the harm they were doing to their firms, all too often, they haven’t been able to stop themselves. As one scholar wrote with regard to U.K. unions: What occurred in industry after industry in the U.K. was a Greek tragedy.… Somehow workers in some sectors have found themselves destroying their firm, fully aware of what they were doing, yet unable to stop. They found themselves answering strike calls … in the full awareness that … the result could only be ruin for all concerned. [355] That description bears a striking resemblance to what has also occurred in many unionized U.S. industries. Around 2015, I asked a former UAW leader whether, if the UAW had known in the 1970s and 1980s what it knows now about the decline of the Big Three, it would have done things differently. His response was, “No.” While he acknowledged that UAW actions hurt the Big Three’s global market share, he believed that union leadership could have acted no differently. If it had, he said, workers would have voted UAW leadership out and installed leaders who would stand up for the interests of workers now. Moreover, while some in the AFL-CIO have called for more industrial policy support, the lion’s share of its efforts to go boosting wages and expanding members. [356] On its web page “What We Care About,” the Federation lists better pay and benefits, civil rights, corporate greed, gender equality, global worker rights, immigration, infrastructure, and workplace health and safety. [357] Lower on the page, on a list of other issues, it does list manufacturing. As Vogel has rightly pointed out, institutionalized civil society after the New Deal accepted and even supported the corporate capitalist system. They just wanted to ensure that broader societal interests were adequately represented, and their concerns addressed. That is no longer the case. Most of these groups, largely funded by major left-wing foundations, now reject the U.S. capitalist system, seeing it as inherently evil and harmful. It is racist, sexist, imperialist, and every other “ist.” Hundreds of these often-well-funded groups push for ever stronger land use and environmental regulations, stronger privacy rules, stronger antitrust prosecution, higher business taxes, and technology bans. The philanthropy consultancy, Blue Tent, has identified over 200 left-leaning foundations in America. [358] These include groups that reject copyright enforcement, seek to hold tech firms “accountable,” promote technology justice, protect individual privacy, oppose new technologies such as facial recognition and AI, highlight “power imbalances,” and want to break-up large firms and regulate large telecom providers to bridge various digital divides. The Ford Foundation alone has funded nearly 100 nonprofit advocacy groups focused on “public interest technology.” [359] Not one comes close to supporting a national power industry strategy. Most of these groups, largely funded by major left-wing foundations, now reject the U.S. capitalist system, seeing it as inherently evil and harmful. At the same time, most free-market foundations fund organizations that are diametrically opposed to the government development of a national power industry strategy because their task is less government. While that can be an important component of a national power industry strategy, if it focuses on eliminating or streamlining regulations inimical to national power industry competitiveness, overall, they oppose the areas where government needs to be more active and strategic. In addition, a variety of nonprofits now mobilize political interests to not only prevent any reforms needed to better compete with China, but also to rachet up new regulatory restrictions. We see this with the pressure environmental organizations exert any time Congress attempts even the most common-sense reform of environmental laws. A national power industry strategy would entail a very different role for U.S. research universities. They would, among other things, need to focus more on STEM education, especially for Americans; on research areas critical to success in national power industries; and on working more closely with industry to ensure that more of the benefits of that research flow to firms in America, rather than China. But the problem is that U.S. universities resist the imposition of even guidance from the federal government. As Vogel argued that U.S. business executives value autonomy from government above all else, the same is true with faculty, who ultimately call the shots at universities. We have seen this with the reaction to President Trump’s “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education,” which would provide universities with a set of benefits if they adopt the measures in the Compact. The point here is not whether the Compact is good, or if the president has the authority to implement it; it’s to show the utter focus on autonomy by higher education. For example, in rejecting the invitation to join, Brown University’s president, Christina Paxson, said that the compact “by its nature and by various provisions would restrict academic freedom and undermine the autonomy of Brown’s governance.” [360] Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), stated: By declining to compromise its core mission, Brown University has affirmed that no amount of federal inducement is worth surrendering the freedom to question, explore and dissent. In rejecting the compact, Brown stands as a bulwark for higher education’s sacred commitment to academic freedom and institutional self-governance. [361] To be sure, they would be mostly correct if they were not receiving funding from taxpayers through federal grants. If they want to give up that, then have at it. But the acceptance of federal funding should come with it an expectation to act in the national interest, not just the university’s own interest, however it defines it. Academic freedom is a code word for being able to say and do whatever they want with virtually no constraints. But with the national industry power war, it is in the national interest for universities to operate differently. This means boosting the quality of undergraduate education from its fairly mediocre levels. Keeping tuition increases reasonable so students can afford education without federal subsidies. Focusing more on STEM education, especially for American students. And focusing on research critical to the success of national power industries. With the national industry power war, it is in the national interest for universities to operate differently. However, as we saw with the vociferous resistance by higher education to the provisions in the Endless Frontier Act (which was incorporated with the CHIPS Act to become the Chips and Science Act) that would have given most of the increase in National Science Foundation funding to the Technology Innovation Partnerships program rather than to traditional programs, we can expect most higher education institutions to actively resist ensuring that higher ed policy be guided by a national advanced industry strategy. They will continue to trot out stale bromides such as academic freedom and Vannevar Bush’s linear model of science that lets researchers study whatever they want and only focus on research publications. Universities that agree to support U.S. national power industries would likely be attacked by their fellow universities and academics. Finally, government. The state itself is an actor advancing interests: something the MAGA right calls the “deep state,” implying that government interests are not national interests. Notwithstanding this radical view, the U.S. state itself is actually weak. Vogel nailed it when he wrote, “The American state still lacks essential information about the basic functioning of the economy and even if that information were available the fragmentation of authority and power within the federal bureaucracy would make any coordinated government policy extremely problematic.” [362] Given the hollowing out of the federal government since he wrote this in 1979, including the recent calamity of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) haphazardly slashing and burning bureaucracy, this is even more true now. [363] To the extent that the state has real capacity, it is largely limited to DOD, and as discussed in later work on policy steps, the problem is that DOD (or now called the Department of War) has become another interest group, focusing on advancing its own narrow military interests rather than national power writ large, especially through a national power industry strategy. In writing about how corporations have to succeed, Gary Hamel and Prahalad stated: To create the future, an entire company, not just a few isolated boffins or ”research fellows” must possess industry foresight. Top management cannot abdicate its responsibility for developing, articulating and sharing a point of view about the future. What is needed are not just skunk works and intrapreneurs, but senior managers who can escape the orthodoxies of the corporation’s current “concept of self.” [364] DOD has become another interest group, focusing on advancing its own narrow military interests rather than national power writ large, especially through a national power industry strategy. They went on to write: Making industry and company conventions explicit, understanding how these conventions could imperil the firm’s success in the future, delving deeply into industry discontinuities, establishing a process for extending industry foresight and working collectively to craft a strategic architecture are the means for genetic reengineering on a large scale. [365] That is all the more true for the USG. But today’s few SES (Senior Executive Service) or political appointees have those capabilities, and as discussed later, there are few easy ways by which they can attain them. When David Vogel wrote his book, majorities in both parties accepted both government and corporate capitalism. The Republicans were always a bit more on the side of corporations. The Democrats were on the side of civil society and used the state to advanced broader public interests and concerns, especially workers’ and consumers’. Now most of the Right wants significantly limited government and some no longer trust corporate America. And much of the Left has rejected large corporations and the capitalist system itself. Vogel noted how the U.S. democratic system, with its open democracy, was one of the few developed economies without a socialist opposition: Whatever may be inconveniences of a relatively open and responsive governmental system to the achievement of specific corporate objectives—and they are often considerable - they are clearly the price the American bourgeoisie pays for a luxury enjoyed by no other business community in the advanced capitalist nations—the absence of a socialist opposition. American executives continually complain about the large number of organizations and interest groups that routinely turn to the state to redress their grievances against the corporation, but this state of affairs certainly preferable to one in which these non or antibusiness factions did not use the political process because they perceived it as fixed against them. The latter would seriously undermine the political stability upon which a sound economic system depends. [366] That is no longer the case. A large swath of progressives now embrace socialism, even if they do not call it that. And it is quite possible that America will become like Europe: a social welfare state wherein socialism represents the Left. Given that any effective national power industry strategy has to be built around large corporations and a strong government role, all this bodes ill for the ability to take effective action. For conservatives, it’s just as bad, if not worse. For much of the post New-Deal through to the election of President Reagan, the business community, and more important conservative intellectuals accepted the New Deal. As Vogel wrote: At his presidential address delivered to the annual meeting of the American Economic Association in 1962, Edward S. Mason noted …the fact that the really revolutionary changes in the role of government and in the relation of various groups to government produced by the depression and the war have not yet been fully accepted in this country. Where counter-revolution is still considered to be a possibility no one is quite prepared to lay down his arms. [367] Dwight Eisenhower warned that abolishing New Deal programs would undermine any political party’s viability, and for decades, Republicans largely grudgingly heeded that caution. Even though many on the Right have long viewed Wilson’s New Freedom, Roosevelt’s New Deal, and Johnson’s Great Society as fundamental deviations from America’s founding principles, conservative politicians, like liberals, have dared not touch them. The policies and programs of those eras were assumed to be sacrosanct pillars of the post-World War II power and prosperity we have known as the American Century. But the counterrevolution was always nascent, occasionally breaking out with someone like Goldwater or Gingrich. Now the counterrevolution has triumphed, working to restore the nation to the pre-New Deal, and even pre-Wilson era. [368] President Trump and the MAGA movement, buoyed by a perception of the Biden administration’s overreach, are now actively revolting against all that was once held sacred. Many are doing so under the banner of “drain the swamp.” More fundamentally, though, the animating desire is to return to the governance of more than a century ago—that of the Gilded Age, an era of small government, protective tariffs, limited immigration, and America as regional power—a period that reached its zenith during the Republican administration of President William McKinley. Given that any effective national power industry strategy has to be built around large corporations and a strong government role, all this bodes ill for the ability to take effective action. Ironically, the business community in the United States distrusts the state because it worries that it will be captured by populist forces that neither understand nor care about the economic system—and even more ominously, they will try to dismantle that system. With such a risk always in the background, U.S. corporate leaders have long preferred to be left alone, and to support a weak central government. If America is to not lose the national power industry war to China, it needs a political economy that puts the restoration of U.S. power, especially from national power industries, at the center. It is ironic that in a Marxist-Leninist China, the last thing the state wants is for democratic forces to derail capitalist progress. To be sure, the CCP inserts itself into capitalists’ business, but it is only to 1) make sure that the capitalists do not challenge the Party and 2) to make sure that the companies advance CCP and Chinese power globally. If America is to not lose the national power industry war to China, it needs a political economy that puts the restoration of U.S. power, especially from national power industries, at the center. Until recently, China’s playbook was to imitate the advances of industrialized countries, but since the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011–2015), the Chinese government has shifted its strategy toward incentivizing innovation. We see that in a variety of advanced sectors. China has named biotechnology as a strategic emerging industry and has set development priorities for drugs, biomedical engineering, agriculture, and biomanufacturing. It has developed a comprehensive national strategy to enhance the innovation capabilities of its domestic biotech industry. The strategy includes subsidies, financial incentives, national reimbursement for innovative therapies; the creation of high-tech science parks, start-up incubators, and public-private partnerships; talent recruitment initiatives; reforms to expedite drug review, especially for domestic products; and efforts to enhance IP protection to foster innovation. China has set several milestones and goals for the industry, including enhancing the originality of biotech through new technologies and products, creating a biotech innovation platform, and strengthening the industrialization of biotechnology. To implement this strategy, China has increased R&D activity and built out its innovation infrastructure—science parks, incubators, and national gene and cell banks. The number of high-quality biotech publications and clinical trials in China has surged. Still, structural challenges remain, such as inconsistent hospital data systems and difficulty translating scientific research into market-ready products, with China lagging behind the United States in commercialization capabilities. However, it is expected that the Chinese share of the global biotech drug market will grow significantly, at the cost of Western leaders’ market share. China’s quantum strategy reflects a clear belief that competing in this field requires central political control, not just industrial strength. Rather than backing a decentralized commercial ecosystem like in the United States, Beijing has placed universities and state-run labs at the center of its quantum push, with funding, talent, and political oversight all flowing through the Party apparatus. The focus is on the areas where state coordination can yield strategic wins—namely, quantum communications and sensing, which are easier to deploy and carry direct national security value. To implement this strategy, the government has folded private industry into its preferred channels. High-profile exits, such as Alibaba and Baidu abandoning their quantum research divisions and transferring their assets to state-linked institutions, reflect a system wherein firms are discouraged from independent leadership and instead are expected to serve as suppliers or technical partners to state-led projects. Rather than bet on uncertain, long-term breakthroughs in quantum computing, China is locking in an early advantage in quantum key distribution (QKD) and quantum sensors, which are more mature fields that can scale faster and shape international norms. For the United States, the impact is dual. First, China’s rapid progress in quantum communications and sensing shortens the window for U.S. institutions to upgrade to post-quantum secure systems. That raises national security risks; if adversaries establish quantum-secure channels or advance quantum sensing before the United States adapts, it could compromise intelligence, defense, and critical infrastructure. Second, China’s early dominance in export-ready quantum systems, especially sensing technologies, threatens U.S. competitiveness in emerging markets. By offering heavily subsidized AI solutions through state-directed firms, China could lock in long-term customers and establish its standards as the default, making it harder for U.S. companies to enter or influence these strategic sectors later on. China is using state power to tilt the AI playing field. Rather than relying on market dynamics alone, China is using state-led tools—subsidies, open-source acceleration, massive data access, and political endorsement—to build national champions and crowd out foreign competitors. Tsinghua-affiliated start-ups such as Zhipu AI and Moonshot AI, backed by government-linked funding and supercomputing access, show how China incubates AI firms within a politically protected ecosystem. These firms now produce competitive large language models, and some, such as DeepSeek, outperform U.S. peers on key benchmarks. China implements this strategy by tightly aligning AI firms’ development with state priorities. The government funnels capital through targeted venture funding, particularly benefiting companies overlooked by private markets, and supports strategic partnerships that quickly scale AI platforms. Firms such as DeepSeek receive explicit political endorsement, securing privileged market positions and accelerating their ability to innovate and commercialize. Furthermore, China leverages its enormous population to generate extensive, unrestricted datasets, feeding AI models at a scale unattainable in democratic societies constrained by privacy rules. This creates a structural advantage, allowing Chinese firms to train advanced AI systems more cost-effectively and rapidly. If China’s model for AI becomes the reference point in fast-growing markets, U.S. firms may find themselves shut out of both standards-setting processes and adoption pathways. This doesn’t mean replicating China’s model, but it does mean recognizing the structural advantages it creates and rethinking the domestic policies that may be holding U.S. companies back. China has pursued an ambitious strategy to become the world’s leading EV and battery manufacturer and, in so doing, displace “Western” (including Japan and South Korea) leadership in internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. The Chinese government began investing in EV-related technologies as early as 2001, when EV technology was introduced as a priority science research project in China’s 10th Five-Year Plan. Subsidies have proven indispensable in building Chinese EV competitiveness. From 2009 to 2023 alone, China channeled $230.9 billion in subsidies and other support to its domestic EV sector. From 2018 to 2023, the Chinese government extended $1.8 billion in subsidies to EV battery developer CATL (Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited) alone. Chinese policymakers have put their thumb on the scale for electric as opposed to ICE vehicle adoption, such as by giving EV owners license plates at no cost and not subjecting them to traffic control measures. China has established the world’s largest public charging infrastructure network. Growth in Chinese competitiveness in autos has been astounding. In 1985, Chinese enterprises manufactured a grand total of 5,200 passenger vehicles; by 2024, they produced 26.8 million vehicles (including 10 million EVs)—21 percent of global production—a share automotive analysts expect will reach one-third by 2030. The Alliance for Automotive Manufacturing has referred to Chinese EV growth as a potential “extinction-level event.” While Chinese EV makers have yet to make significant inroads in the U.S. market, they’re capturing considerable market share in third-market countries. The United States has responded by offering 100 percent tariffs on Chinese EV imports. Ever since the 2013 Third Party Plenum, the Chinese government has made semiconductors the country’s top industrial innovation priority. China’s “2014 National Guidelines for Development and Promotion of the Integrated Circuit Industry” called for $150 billion in central government investments to establish a fully “closed-loop” semiconductor ecosystem in China. The plan called for eliminating China’s trade deficit in ICs by 2030 and achieving 70 percent self-sufficiency in semiconductors by that year. Chris Miller has suggested that adding up semiconductor-sector investments made by Chinese governments at all levels, China “has probably invested the equivalent of [America’s] CHIPS Act virtually every year since 2014.” [369] One OECD study of the global semiconductor industry from 2014–2018 found that China accounted for 86 percent of all below-market equity injections and that subsidies accounted for 40 percent of foundry SMIC’s revenues. The Chinese government stood up NAND memory-maker YMTC from whole cloth by a $24 billion investment. China added more chip-making capacity than the rest of the world combined in 2024, with most centered in the legacy (28 nm or greater) market, which is particularly concerning because Chinese companies are gaining a foothold there and selling products 20–30 percent less than Western competitors, disrupting the industry’s innovation economics. Huawei Ascend AI and Kirin mobile chips are increasingly capable and pose market share threats to U.S. companies in China and third-party markets. Elsewhere, Document 79 articulates an import substitution approach that has directed Chinese EV and ICT firms to remove foreign semiconductors from their products. The final report in this Chinese National Power Industry War series will be a comprehensive and detailed policy agenda. But as a way to frame that, based on the argument presented here, this appendix briefly describes major changes needed in various policy areas. For the free-market Right, the goal of antitrust is short-term consumer welfare; and for the populist Left and Right, the goal is attacking and breaking up big companies. It is time to incorporate a national power industry “screen” in antitrust analysis and enforcement wherein national power industries would be treated differently. Merger review, as well as enforcement, would be viewed in equal part of how much the actions would hurt U.S. power industry capabilities. U.S. environmental regulation came of age in an era of supposed plenty with virtually no international industry competition. And over the years, it was largely a one-way ratchet, with more regulation added on. Some regulation makes sense. But much of it could be implemented in ways that are less damaging to competitiveness and with lower compliance costs. And some are just unnecessary. The poster child of this is the National Environmental Protection Act, which imposes massive costs and delays, or even bans, on needed development. Again, as with antitrust, environmental regulation needs to reformed and implemented through the “screen” of national power industry health. Industry is regulated in a number of ways besides environmental regulation. This includes sector-specific regulation (e.g., freight rail, housing construction, etc.), data privacy regulation, worker safety, and others. Again, as with environmental regulation, these were put in place and enforced with little consideration for impact on national power industry competitiveness. That needs to change. For most Republicans (and neoclassical economists), the best business tax code is a broad base (few to no exemptions of incentives and a low rate). For most Democrats, the best business tax code is one that raises the effective tax rate of large corporations. A national power industry-based tax code reduces the effective rate on business, but especially on national power industries, by boosting specific incentives to align their interests with national interests for a strong national power industry sector. Both parties are afraid of the wrath of selfish American voters of raising taxes on anyone but the rich. And most Republicans favor cutting USG discretionary spending, including on activities that would support U.S. national power industry competitiveness. Most Democrats want to boost spending to help current consumers and workers, even if this means less public investment that would support power industries. And both parties are terrified of controlling entitlement spending, even though without that, there is almost no way to generate the fiscal headroom for the kinds of direct and indirect (tax) expenditures needed to win the national power industry war with China. Most in Washington are loathe to prioritize particular industries in trade policy—""agriculture is as important as aerospace.” That needs to change, where the interests of U.S. national power industries are paramount on trade policy and negotiations may require comprising with other nations in ways that hurt nonpower industries while helping U.S. power industries. At the same time, traditional trade supporters see free trade with all nations as good, and populist trade advocates on both the Right and the Left now reject global trade and seek autocracy; sometimes euphemistically called a “trade agenda for the middle class.” A national power industry trade agenda prioritizes China, including strengthening allied trade relations and allied efforts to restrict Chinese exports, especially of power industry goods and services. U.S. foreign policy on the right prioritizes the United States being the policeman throughout the world. On the Left, it prioritizes pushing for human rights throughout the world, including in China. In addition, foreign policy has long been willing to spend “national power industry capital” to achieve these globalist foreign policy goals. We see this in how the United States has consistently engaged in export controls to punish nations for taking actions we didn’t like, even though that came at the cost of U.S. power industry competitiveness. A national power industry foreign policy prioritizes China over all else, and seeks to advance U.S. national power interests throughout the world. Since the start of the first Cold War, U.S. policy has idolatrized small business, blessing it with a wide panoply of regulatory, tax, and spending protections and favors. The Left supports it because it believes that it can convince petit-bourgeois small business owners to think of themselves as part of the proletariat oppressed by large capitalist corporations. The Right supports them because they see them as being driven by Adam Smith-like competition, unlike large supposedly woke, crony capitalist large corporations. In a world of national power industry war with China, the nation can longer afford to do this. It costs too much money, and it weakens power industry firms. In a power industry world, all U.S. policy would become size neutral. Banking and investment regulation has largely supported financial markets, even though many of them have become zero-sum casinos benefiting a small cadre of billionaire hedge fund managers, driving national power industry corporations toward short-term financial maximization at the cost of long-term competitiveness. Investment regulation needs to focus first on how to drastically reduce the size of the industry as it sucks off needed talent and GDP away from national power industries. Second, it needs to reform the industry away from its parasitic short-termism toward long-term national wealth and power creation. Science policy still is under the post-WWII shadow of Vannevar Bush and the linear model of science focused on prioritizing early-stage basic science of whatever scientists want to study. Science policy should evolve to “science, technology, and engineering” policy and more money should go to targeted areas critical to advancing U.S. national power industries and in ways that involve industry more. Whether that can be done at the National Science Foundation with its deep commitment to the desires of individual scientists and research universities, or whether it requires the creation of separate institution is an open question. There is a reason the United States has no real national power industry strategy and why so few policy areas are aligned to support that. And it is because there are few forces in American politics pushing for this. Most Republicans, including most “Trumpians,” still are committed to small government and “freedom” from government. That is largely what the president wants. And most Democrats now are firmly redistributionists, wanting more now, especially for those “oppressed” by the U.S. capitalist system and big corporations. That is largely what President Biden pushed for. Not losing the national power industry war with China requires more state capacity and action, strong support for power industry corporations, and way more sacrifice of current consumption toward future investment. As Robert Kagan of the Brookings Institution put it: If and when American power declines, the institutions and norms that American power has supported will decline, too. Or more likely, if history is a guide, they may collapse altogether as we make a transition to another kind of world order, or to disorder. We may discover then that the U.S. was essential to keeping the present world order together and that the alternative to American power was not peace and harmony but chaos and catastrophe—which is what the world looked like right before the American order came into being.

[1] That is why the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) established the Hamilton Center on Industrial Strategy. [2] It is dedicated to advancing a comprehensive framework and specific policy agenda to maintain America’s competitive edge. [3] With America now facing an aggressive and often malign challenge from China, there is an urgent need for stronger policy advocacy and thought leadership that articulates the case for robust national strategic-industry policy. [4] This policy must focus on critical, dual-use technologies and industries in advanced, traded sectors of the economy. Such an approach requires firmly rebutting the deeply held view of most economists and many policymakers that all industries are created equal. In other words, no more “potato chips, computer chips—what’s the difference?” Strategic-industry policy demands making tough political choices and “picking winners”—not individual firms or specific technologies, but rather certain industries and categories of technology that are critical to the nation’s future. Finally, it requires a government that is knowledgeable and sophisticated about industry operations and the effects of policy on traded sectors. [5] Under the Hamilton Center, ITIF has launched a major research project focusing on China’s industrial goals and strategies, their impact on U.S. industrial power, how U.S. policymakers and experts should think about this challenge, and what a detailed and comprehensive policy agenda should look like. The project’s core thesis is that a specific set of industries acts as a vital wellspring of national power, either because they directly support the defense industrial base or because they limit dependence on U.S. adversaries that could be used for coercion. ITIF calls them “national power industries.” Without major structural change in U.S. policy—akin to the strategy America implemented at the beginning of the Cold War—we believe that the United States’ national power industries will weaken significantly, if not die, in turn weakening the U.S. defense industrial base and giving China techno-economic leverage over America in a broad range of areas, not just rare earth minerals. At its core, this challenge requires formulating and implementing a national power industry strategy grounded not just in economics but also in corporate strategy literature. This project focuses on several objectives. First, this report provides an overarching analytical framework and an enumeration of the stakes, including an assessment of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP’s) intent. It then proposes the concept of national power industries, classifying U.S. industries into four categories of relative importance to the power industry competition. The report examines why current techno-economic and trade policy doctrines that dominate Washington, DC, are flawed and misguided, then summarizes 18 different strategic directions offered by conventional foreign policy thinking and explains why these approaches are inadequate. Following this analysis, the report draws on corporate strategy literature to outline what a coherent and effective grand strategy for the national power industry competition should look like. Finally, it examines the political economy of implementing such a strategy. After this report, the project will conduct a series of quantitative and qualitative analyses examining the past and present performance of U.S. power industries, including comparisons to China. This analysis will examine impacts on the overall U.S. economy, the 50 states, and the competition between China and the United States for global market share in national power industries. Finally, the project will outline a comprehensive agenda for U.S. industrial policy that can be implemented by Congress and the administration. This will include both specific policies and recommendations for reorganizing government. The United States faces an existential challenge in China’s systematic campaign to dominate the advanced industries that enable national power in the 21st century. Unlike any competitor in American history, China combines the continental scale of a 1.4-billion-person economy with a Marxist-Leninist political system explicitly committed to achieving techno-economic supremacy over the Western democratic world. This is not normal economic competition between market economies—it is a carefully orchestrated, multi-decade strategic campaign to displace U.S. industrial capabilities, weaken allied nations, and fundamentally reshape the global order under CCP leadership. The stakes transcend economics. National power today depends on strength in what this report terms “national power industries”—a spectrum of sectors spanning pure defense production, dual-use technologies employed in both military and commercial applications, and enabling industries that support the broader industrial commons. These include semiconductors, aerospace, biopharmaceuticals, telecommunications equipment, advanced chemicals, precision machinery, robotics, artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and dozens of other sectors in which weakened or fatally injured firms would grant China dangerous leverage over the United States and its allies, as well as weaken U.S. defense production capabilities. On its current trajectory, it is likely that China will soon amass significantly greater capabilities than the United States will in national power industries. This competition occurs against a backdrop of American policy failure. For over two decades, U.S. leaders across both parties have operated under the assumption that China was becoming a “normal” market economy that would gradually liberalize politically and economically. That assumption has proven catastrophically wrong. China today is more authoritarian, more aggressive internationally, and more committed to state-directed capitalism than at any point since Mao’s death. On its current trajectory, it is likely that China will soon amass significantly greater capabilities than the United States will in national power industries. With those greater capabilities will come geostrategic hegemony over the West, unless the United States forestalls that outcome by adopting a new, transformative national power industry strategy that goes beyond a mere competitiveness or national innovation strategy. This is not a war that the United States and allies can win in the sense of significantly weakening or retarding the growth of China’s own national power industries. The only way Chinese attacks will end is if China becomes a free, democratic country. But the United States and allies can avoid defeat—keeping their national power industries relatively strong—by working together and adopting national power industry strategies. Perhaps the most damning evidence of Chinese intentions comes from internal Communist Party documents and speeches intended for party members rather than foreign audiences. As China scholar Daniel Tobin has documented, these reveal a regime explicitly committed to Marxist-Leninist global ambitions that go far beyond merely moving up the value chain and growing its economy. Xi Jinping has repeatedly framed China’s rise in ideological terms, stating that “scientific socialism is full of vitality in 21st century China” and that China offers “a new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence.” In a 2013 speech to senior party officials, Xi declared that “the viewpoint of historical materialism that capitalism is doomed to failure and socialism will prevail” remains valid, and that China must “seize the initiative, win the competitive edge, and secure our future” in a “long-term cooperation and rivalry between the two social systems.” Documents from the party’s 20th Congress state that China’s success has “significantly shifted the worldwide historical evolution of the contest between the two different ideologies and social systems of socialism and capitalism in a way that favors socialism.” Chinese leaders explicitly describe their work as part of a “great struggle” and “systems contest with Western capitalist democracy,” using terminology that leaves no ambiguity about their intentions. On technology and industry specifically, party documents are equally explicit. The minister of Science and Technology wrote in the People’s Daily that “the scientific and technological revolution and the contest between major powers are intertwined; the high-tech field has become the forefront and main battlefield of international competition.” Another official commentary stated: “To a certain extent, those who gain access to the Internet will gain the world. Core technology is an important weapon for the country.” China’s Made in China 2025 plan, while officially downplayed after international backlash, clearly articulates the goal: “Building an internationally competitive manufacturing industry is the only way China can enhance its comprehensive national strength, ensure national security, and build itself into a world power.” The plan calls for China to “seize the commanding heights of a new round of competition in the manufacturing industry” and achieve innovation leadership “ranking first globally.” The CCP follows a predictable playbook across industry after industry. Leading Chinese scholar Lu Yongxiang stated in 2024 that “by 2035, ‘Made in China’ will surpass the United States and become the global leader,” noting this would thrust the world into a “new era”—explicitly referencing an era of Chinese dominance. These are not the words of a nation seeking merely to “catch up” or achieve “legitimate development.” They are the explicit articulation of a campaign for global advanced industrial hegemony. China’s actions match its rhetoric. The CCP follows a predictable playbook across industry after industry. First, attract foreign investment by promising market access. Second, coerce technology transfer through joint venture requirements and other mechanisms—pressure the U.S. Trade Representative has characterized as “particularly intense.” Third, support domestic firms in copying and incorporating foreign technology while building indigenous capabilities through programs such as the 2006 Medium- and Long-term Program for Science and Technology Development, which identified 402 core technologies to master. Fourth, carve out and protect the Chinese market for Chinese firms, excluding foreign competitors once domestic champions can reasonably serve the entire Chinese market. Fifth, provide massive subsidies—estimated at minimum 1.73 percent of Chinese gross domestic product (GDP) annually, or over $400 billion per year, though actual figures are likely far higher accounting for provincial and local support. Finally, support Chinese firms “going out” to capture global market share, particularly in developing nations through Belt and Road Initiative investments exceeding $1 trillion. These dwarf the minimal industrial subsidies the U.S. government (USG) provides. The scale of Chinese subsidies dwarfs anything in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) nations. A German institute found that in 2022, 99 percent of listed Chinese firms received direct government subsidies, with electric vehicle (EV) maker BYD alone receiving over $3.7 billion. Chinese industrial subsidies were 4.5 times greater than U.S. subsidies as a share of GDP. Combined with a chronically undervalued currency, suppressed domestic consumption, and closed markets, these subsidies have enabled Chinese firms to sell below cost for years or decades, systematically destroying foreign competitors’ market positions. This is not to say that all Chinese efforts or innovation are win-lose. If China invents a cure for Alzheimer’s, the world benefits (assuming the United States or its allies would not also do so). But this would also reduce U.S. (and allied) strength in the pharmaceutical industry. Overall, the policy debate about China is largely dominated by international relations scholars and experts, not business or industrial strategy experts. The former are aware of the global competition for leadership in advanced industries, but they largely see it as subservient to overall foreign policy considerations and goals. Moreover, few understand the operation of advanced industries, the nature of the competition, or the importance of barriers to entry and reentry. As such, the prevailing narratives largely ignore techno-economic and trade war implications and the implications for U.S. power. Current U.S. thinking about China coalesces around three main strategic approaches, all of which are inadequate to the challenge. The first camp, still influential in much of the U.S. foreign policy establishment, prioritizes maintaining cooperative relations with China, even in the face of CCP behavior that harms U.S. national power industry capabilities. These experts argue that China’s growth benefits global prosperity, that Chinese cooperation is essential for addressing climate change and other global challenges, and that confrontation risks becoming a catastrophic conflict. A 2019 open letter signed by over 100 prominent scholars claimed that “we do not believe Beijing is an economic enemy or an existential national security threat” and argued that “the fear that Beijing will replace the United States as the global leader is exaggerated.” This camp consistently minimizes Chinese malfeasance while emphasizing supposed benefits of engagement. They cite Chinese economic growth as driving global prosperity (ignoring that China’s persistent trade surpluses actually reduce GDP elsewhere). In arguing that cooperation is needed on issues such as climate change, pandemic response, and AI governance, they gloss over the question of why the United States should be the supplicant when China has equal or greater interest in addressing these challenges. Their fundamental error is treating China as a partner rather than a strategic competitor. Engagers assume that continued dialogue and economic ties will moderate China’s behavior, when two decades of evidence proves otherwise. They prioritize the process of engagement over the substance of outcomes, accepting Chinese predatory practices as the price of maintaining access and conversation. A second camp acknowledges China’s rise but counsels patience, predicting that internal contradictions will lead to Chinese economic stagnation or political crisis. These analysts point to demographic decline, the housing bubble, government debt, and the inefficiencies of state capitalism as harbingers of inevitable Chinese failure. To be sure, many advance the well-trodden prescriptions such as improved K-12 education, more high-skill immigration, smarter regulation, and more government spending on science. But they will not go so far as to support a national power industry strategy. This “Peak China” thesis is seductive because it requires no painful U.S. policy changes. If China is destined to collapse under its own weight, the United States need only wait and maintain its existing approaches to the economy, trade, and national security. Proponents cite any negative Chinese economic news as evidence that their predictions are materializing, while ignoring continued Chinese gains in technological capabilities and global market share of advanced industries. The fatal flaw is mistaking China for the Soviet Union. Unlike Soviet command economics, Chinese state capitalism has proven remarkably effective at generating growth and technological advancement. The CCP studied why the Soviet Union failed and adopted fundamentally different economic management—allowing market forces to operate within state-directed strategic frameworks rather than attempting to centrally plan everything. Moreover, even if China faces economic headwinds from demographics or debt, these business-cycle challenges do not negate its structural advantages in the techno-economic competition. Chinese firms will continue benefiting from massive subsidies, protected markets, and patient capital regardless of GDP growth rates. Waiting for China to self-destruct while Chinese companies dismantle Western industries one after another is a prescription for defeat. The third camp acknowledges the challenge China presents but argues that American innovation superiority will enable the United States to prevail. These “dynamists” focus on deregulation, immigration reform, scientific research funding, and nurturing entrepreneurship—particularly in cutting-edge fields such as AI, quantum computing, and synthetic biology. This view holds that the United States need not defend legacy industries because American innovators will create entirely new sectors and the United States will lead them. Why fight over solar panels or EVs when we can dominate AI and quantum? The prescription is to boost science funding, reduce regulatory barriers, import more STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) talent, and trust that Silicon Valley-style innovation will deliver victory. The problems with this strategy are multiple. First, with a few exceptions (e.g., AI), it is industry-agnostic—there is no guarantee that market-driven innovation will produce capabilities in sectors that matter most for national power. Second, the United States has repeatedly lost production of technologies it invented, from televisions to solar panels to batteries, as other nations have commercialized American discoveries. Innovation alone does not ensure domestic production or competitive strength. Third, advanced defense systems increasingly rely on commercial technologies (spin-on rather than spin-off), making a strategy that abandons commercial sectors to China while hoping to maintain defense-only production unrealistic and prohibitively expensive. Fourth, the “industrial commons”—the ecosystem of suppliers, skilled workers, and manufacturing capabilities—erodes when industries disappear, making future innovation harder. Intel founder Andy Grove’s warning resonates: “Abandoning today’s ‘commodity’ manufacturing can lock you out of tomorrow’s emerging industry.” Finally, China is not ceding emerging technologies. Chinese firms are competitive or leading in AI (see Alibaba, Baidu, and DeepSeek), quantum communications, commercial space, robotics, and biotechnology. The notion that the United States can retreat to “higher ground” in emerging tech while China dominates established industries ignores that Chinese firms are aggressively pursuing both. The deeper problem is that dominant U.S. economic doctrines are fundamentally mismatched to the era of national power industry competition. The reigning paradigm in U.S. economic policymaking—which critics call “neoliberalism”—treats all industries as equivalent. Financial services and semiconductor fabrication are no different; both simply respond to market signals. The goal is to maximize consumer welfare through efficient resource allocation, which markets achieve better than governments do. The reigning paradigm in U.S. economic policymaking—which critics call “neoliberalism”—treats all industries as equivalent. In this framework, Chinese subsidies (including low labor costs and lax environmental regulations) are gifts to American consumers (lower prices!), not strategic attacks. Trade deficits reflect American prosperity (we’re rich enough to buy foreign goods!), not industrial weakness. Offshoring production to China demonstrates smart capital allocation by U.S. firms seeking higher returns, not a national security vulnerability. Consumer welfare economics has no concept of strategic industries or national power. Its proponents argue that “countries don’t compete, only companies do” and that concerns about industrial structure reflect economically illiterate protectionism. The Peterson Institute epitomizes this view, arguing that U.S.-China trade is “clearly win-win” and that “Chinese companies have a right to compete with U.S. companies and succeed in any sector, including in high-tech.” This doctrine might have been adequate when America faced no serious techno-economic competitor; it is catastrophically inadequate against China’s state capitalist predation. Markets have no inherent reason to preserve semiconductor fabrication, aerospace, or pharmaceutical production domestically. They are equally happy producing legal services, retail, and hospitality, none of which enable national power. But the reality of this techno-economic and trade attack fundamentally undercuts the foundation of consumer welfare economics and exposes its inability to address the current challenge. If national power is the ultimate goal, not consumer welfare, then this doctrine fails, at least in guiding the share of the economy composed of national economic power industries. If a nation’s industrial mix is critical, then a doctrine that gives equal weight to potato chips and computer chips fails. The ascendant alternative on the Left is equally unsuited to the challenge. Neo–New Dealism focuses on redistribution, social justice, and worker welfare overgrowth and competitiveness. Its industrial policy priorities are human services (childcare, eldercare), climate-focused sectors (renewable energy), and breaking up large corporations through aggressive antitrust. While rhetorically supporting “industrial policy,” progressives’ actual agenda—drug price controls, restricting intellectual property (IP), mandating labor standards that limit automation, attacking profitable corporations as exploitative—systematically weakens the large advanced-technology firms that must serve as national champions against Chinese competitors. Moreover, neo–New Dealism’s massive social spending agenda would consume the fiscal resources needed for strategic industrial investment. Its anticorporate ideology and deep suspicion of business-government collaboration make the public-private partnerships required for an effective national power industry strategy politically toxic. The reality of the CCP’s techno-economic and trade war on the West undercuts the foundations of neo–New Deal progressivism. If the United States is in an existential contest for global power, then boosting taxes and regulations on business is especially ill-advised, as are the neo-Brandeisian campaign to destroy large corporations and separate unrestrained demands from organized labor. Progressive advocates know this quite well, which is why they go to any end to deny that China is even a competitor. The United States needs a fundamentally new framework: a national power industry strategy. This approach recognizes the following: ▪ Industries differ fundamentally in strategic importance. Semiconductors and furniture are not equivalent. Some sectors—defense, dual-use, and enabling—are critical to national power and must be prioritized even at short-term economic cost. ▪ Markets are indifferent to national power. Unregulated market forces will not automatically preserve strategic capabilities. Government must actively shape industrial structure through strategy, not just generic competitiveness or innovation policies. ▪ China is a strategic competitor, not a normal trading partner. Chinese mercantilism requires defensive measures (restricting imports produced unfairly) and offensive support (strengthening domestic champions in national power industries) that violate free-market and progressive orthodoxies. ▪ Production matters as much as innovation. The United States cannot rely on inventing technologies that China then produces. Manufacturing capabilities, supply chain resilience, and industrial commons must be preserved domestically in strategic sectors. ▪ Long-term strategic positioning trumps short-term efficiency. Maintaining redundant capacity, subsidizing strategic industries, and accepting higher consumer prices are necessary costs of not losing the techno-economic war. This requires jettisoning the deeply held view that governments should not “pick winners.” Markets might optimize GDP growth, but only by happenstance will this generate needed national power industry capabilities. Policymakers must embrace strategic industry selection and support, drawing on business strategy frameworks rather than consumer welfare economics. The political economy obstacles to a national power industry strategy are severe. U.S. business leaders, shaped by decades of financial capitalism prioritizing quarterly returns and shareholder value, distrust government involvement and focus myopically on firm-level profitability rather than systemic strength. Unlike their predecessors from the 1940s–1970s who saw themselves as corporate statesmen with responsibilities to the broader capitalist system, today’s executives view government industrial policy as either incompetent interference or the thin edge of socialist control. Labor unions pursue short-term wage gains that often undermine firms’ long-term global competitiveness because they are unable to escape the prisoner’s dilemma of aggressive bargaining today leading to job losses to less-constrained Chinese rivals tomorrow. Conservative organizations reflexively oppose the government activism required for industrial strategy, while progressive organizations reflexively oppose supporting corporations. Neither party’s dominant coalition supports the combination of strong state capacity and empowered corporate champions that a national power industry strategy requires. Perhaps most critically, the USG itself lacks the analytical capacity, institutional structures, and personnel with expertise to formulate and execute sophisticated industrial strategy. Unlike China, where officials study industrial policy as a discipline and spend careers mastering sectoral dynamics, U.S. policymakers typically have backgrounds in law or generalist economics divorced from operational understanding of specific industries and technologies. The United States requires political, policy, and institutional transformation comparable to previous pivots after the War of 1812, the Civil War, and World War II. In all three cases, war provided the spur to overcome inertia and interest group resistance. We certainly hope it will not take a physical war to achieve similar transformation today. Either way, the organizing principle of economic policy must shift from maximizing consumer welfare or spurring social justice to ensuring that the United States maintains superior capabilities in national power industries relative to China. The simplest measures of this are the share of these industries’ global output that is produced in the United States and the share of U.S. production that occurs in allied nations. Related measures are the technological sophistication of U.S. products and services in national power industries compared with those of Chinese competitors. This demands classifying industries by strategic importance, developing sophisticated strategies for priority sectors informed by business strategy principles rather than economics, restricting unfairly traded Chinese goods’ access to allied markets, substantially increasing public and private investment in strategic sectors (on the order of $100 billion per year in tax incentives and direct expenditures for at least a decade), coordinating with allies to present unified responses, and building government institutional capacity for industrial strategy. The United States requires political, policy, and institutional transformation comparable to previous pivots after the War of 1812, the Civil War, and World War II. The costs will be significant: Implementing a national power industry strategy will bring higher prices for certain consumer goods, increased government spending, greater fiscal discipline elsewhere, and reduced returns for some investors as capital is channeled toward strategic rather than merely profitable uses. But the alternative is worse: a future in which Chinese dominance of advanced industries leaves the United States dependent on an adversary for critical technologies, unable to defend its interests or protect its allies, and relegated to second-tier status in a China-dominated world order. History shows that America can make fundamental pivots when circumstances demand. Whether it can do so absent the shock of military conflict—which might come too late, after critical capabilities are already lost—remains the defining question of our era. The window for effective action is narrowing. Chinese positions in industry after industry are becoming entrenched, protected by economies of scale, learning curves, network effects, and the enormous barriers to reentry that characterize advanced manufacturing. The reality is that once advanced industry capabilities are lost, they are extremely difficult to resurrect. The choice facing America is stark and unavoidable: Fundamentally reform techno-economic policy now by embracing the uncomfortable truth that some industries matter far more than others—and by recognizing that preserving them requires active government strategy—or accept a managed decline into second-tier status while China’s techno-economic dominance translates into geopolitical supremacy. There is no third option, no magical innovation breakthrough that will solve the problem without hard choices and real sacrifices. The United States remains far stronger than any declining power in history. Its advantages in innovation ecosystems, allied networks, capital markets, universities, and democratic legitimacy provide a foundation for successful competition if properly mobilized. But time is not on America’s side. Every industry lost makes recovery harder; every year of Chinese industrial expansion shifts the balance further; every failure to act because it violates free-market or progressive orthodoxies surrenders ground that cannot be regained. The techno-economic war with China is the central challenge of the 21st century. America’s response will determine not just its own future but the future of the liberal democratic world. National power is a country’s ability to both prevent other states from taking actions against its core interests and impose its will on other nations. Traditionally, national power was largely determined by military power. In the globally integrated economy of the 21st century, a key enabler of national power is strength in industries that not only support weapons system development and production, but also provide leverage over adversaries and limit their leverage over us. This leverage can be directly related to defense, as when China produces key materials and parts going into U.S. weapons systems (which it currently does) or indirectly such as when China is able to cripple key U.S. industries. [6] We call these key industries that are vital to the country’s strategic interests “national power industries.” With this context, let’s start with a series of key questions that, if answered in the affirmative, should form an immutable logic chain in support of a paradigmatically different kind of U.S. techno-economic and trade policy. First, does the United States need to be the strongest power nation on Earth, especially over China? If it doesn’t, then status quo economic and trade policies from the Left and Right will suffice. Second, if it does, then to what extent does national power come from relative strength in certain industries, particularly military, dual-use, and industries that enable the industrial commons that defense and dual-use industries rely on? If power is only loosely related to those types of industries, then the status quo policies will suffice. Third, if national power is significantly enabled by a certain class of industries, then to what extent is China seeking and capable of gaining relative strength over the United States and its allies in these industries? Related to that, is competition in these industries mostly win-lose, wherein China’s gains come at the expense of U.S. (and allied) losses? If the answer is either that China is not succeeding in these industries or that its success does not come at the expense of U.S. capabilities, then status quo policies will suffice. But if the answer to all these questions is yes—as ITIF argues for in this report—then the implications are profound. The logic chain points inexorably to the conclusion that unless the United States (and its allies) is stronger than China in particular industries and thus has more techno-economic leverage over China than China has over us, then U.S. power vis-à-vis China will be limited and there will be transformative consequences for the global balance of power and U.S. national interests. That logic chain has, or at least should have, profound implications for U.S. techno-economic and trade policy. It establishes that the conventional neoclassical, consumer-welfare–based economics that has dominated U.S. policymaking for more than 50 years needs to be scrapped for the simple reason that it is agnostic to national industry structure. As such, unless the country adopts a new strategy, not losing the power industry war with China will come down to happenstance and luck. This is because the dominant view in Washington, even among most Democrats, is that markets determine industry structure and all industries are of equal value. Financial services are no different than semiconductor production. It cannot be stressed enough that the acceptance of this core doctrine underpins virtually all U.S. techno-economic and trade policy. It explains the support for free markets and free trade and the aversion to “picking winners.” It explains why economic policy on the Right is about enabling market forces and on the Left about achieving better social policy outcomes by taxing and regulating the private sector. Both are indifferent to industry structure. In the past, this industry-agnostic, market-economics framework was not detrimental to national power because the United States did not face a competent techno-economic adversary in the form of the Soviet Union. In fact, the Soviet economy was incredibly fragile, and it made the U.S. economy seem like a goliath by comparison. [7] That unfortunately instilled a dangerous hubris into policy thinking that America suffers from to this day. Now that America faces a likely superior techno-economic adversary in the form of China led by the CCP, that doctrine and the policies that flow from it are no longer purpose-fit and need to be retired as quickly as possible. A world in which the United States (and allies) cannot lose power industry strength is a world that calls for a fundamentally new kind of techno-economic and trade policy. But the next question is whether the usual alternatives to free-market economics—competitiveness policy, innovation policy, technology policies, and/or manufacturing policy—are the right paths to follow. To be sure, these differ from free-market frameworks in that they privilege certain things over others: a better trade balance in advanced industries, more innovation, more output, and jobs in technology industries and manufacturing. However, while certainly a better fit for the world the United States and allied nations now find themselves in, these approaches are still inadequate because they advocate only for broad outcomes, and like free-market doctrine, they are indifferent to power industry strategy. Even if these policies are adequate and successful—to date, they have been inadequate—there is no guarantee that adopting them would produce requisite capabilities in the industries that the United States most needs to bolster in order to have superior power over China. If we get more toy and lumber manufacturing, but not more machine-tool and semiconductor manufacturing, the United States will lose out to China. In short, the United States (and its allies) need to be stronger than China in the industries that are wellsprings of national power in order to prevent China from asserting power and leverage over the United States and its allies. And a world in which the United States and its allies cannot lose strength in national power industries is a world that calls for a fundamentally new kind of techno-economic and trade policy. Circumstances have compelled the United States to make significant structural techno-economic and trade policy changes before: after the War of 1812, after the Civil War, and after WWII. It is once again time for America to make such fundamental changes in policy. The stakes then were less significant for the simple reason that there was much less global integration, and our adversaries were weaker. Today, the stakes and the conditions are fundamentally different. China is the first nation in over 125 years with the ability to challenge the United States from a techno-industrial perspective. In previous instances, it took wars to trigger this kind of fundamental structural change in policy and institutions. Hopefully, it will not take a kinetic war to bring needed change today. Because if it did, there is every reason to believe that the United States and allies will already have irrevocably lost many of their power industry capabilities and prohibitive barriers to entry will leave slim prospects for regaining them. Unfortunately, status quo thinking and vested interests hinder power-industry economics from emerging. First, most foreign policy experts, even while acknowledging the authoritarian rule of Xi Jinping, continue to believe that China is a normal, market-oriented, emerging economy and that “socialism with Chinese characteristics” is just a slogan used for domestic purposes to mask China’s true capitalist nature. Second, while there is growing awareness of the West’s techno-economic dependence on China, that dependence is generally seen as limited to a few narrow areas, such as rare earth minerals, which are said to be easily fixed with the right policies. Third, the conventional view of international economics is both that trade is welfare-maximizing for all parties and that while companies may compete, countries do not. In other words, there is no battle for global market share in key national power industries. Finally, even the most die-hard China hawks and manufacturing supporters do not view the world in terms of power-industry competition with China. For them, getting more U.S. manufacturing jobs is the goal, whether they support national power or not. In a world with these assumptions, status-quo responses suffice. The United States and its allies compete with China and others for market share in advanced industries, and we win some and lose some. And to the extent we lose, we just create new industries and firms because of our inherent innovation strengths. Besides, old industries are for losers. To the extent trade barriers arise, they are handled through normal bilateral or multilateral processes. And domestically, the United States can rely on existing economic policies and institutional structures to ensure reasonable levels of competitiveness and prosperity. U.S. techno-economic and trade policy needs to have as its inspiration and fundamental organizing principle not ensuring economic freedom and efficiency, not social justice, and not stopping climate change—but also not losing in a wide array of strategic industries. Too many U.S. experts, pundits, and policymakers see the CCP as perhaps a bit more focused on industrial policy and a bit less interested in obeying global trade rules than the West is, but not an assertive Marxist-Leninist actor that stands apart. As such, there is no need for a radical overhaul of U.S. techno-economic and trade policy. (Obviously the Trump administration and most China hawks are not in this camp.) As described herein, there are many reasons for the resistance to accept this new reality. But this new reality needs to be accepted and acted upon. This report proceeds from the fundamental view that the CCP seeks global hegemony, that it views techno-economic dominance in national power industries as a key pillar of that long-standing campaign, and that it will do virtually anything to win that quest. As such, the United States and its democratic allies who stand for freedom and human rights need to respond by fundamentally rethinking and restructuring their techno-economic and trade policies. This boils down to a simple but fundamentally far-reaching proposal: U.S. (and allied) techno-economic and trade policy needs to have as its inspiration and fundamental organizing principle, not ensuring economic freedom and efficiency, not prioritizing social justice, not stopping climate change, and not keep AI from taking over—but instead not losing in a wide array of strategic industries. I say “not losing,” as opposed to winning, because China is such a formidable competitor—with a massive domestic and friendly international market (e.g., Belt and Road nations) and an enormous “bank account” to subsidize its way to power industry market share—that it is likely not be possible to keep Chinese firms from being the leaders in many national power industries, especially in non-OECD markets. But what the West can and must do is to avoid losing its own power industry capabilities. [8] National power industries are not just any manufacturing or even technologically advanced industries. They can be thought of as three categories, from most important to least: military industries, dual-use industries, and enabling industries. Examples of military industries are guided missiles and tank production. Examples of dual use are electronic displays and semiconductors, which are used in both defense and commercial industries. Imagine as a thought exercise that China dominated optics and displays. This would give China the ability to cripple U.S. defense capabilities because optics and display technologies are critical for night-vision goggles, heads-up instrument displays for fighter pilots, rifle scopes, and myriad other military applications. Enabling industries include automobiles and heavy construction equipment, which help support the industrial commons needed for dual-use and defense industries. Industries such as furniture, cosmetics, sporting goods, wind turbines, wood products, cement, and toys are not national power industries, in part because losing them would not create any serious vulnerabilities to China. Kids might not have many toys, but we can live with that. The same is true for virtually all nontraded sectors, which are, by definition, not subject to competition from foreign imports (e.g., barber shops, personal service providers, etc.) It is time for the United States government to craft a coherent power industry strategy. Because maintaining allied strength in national power industries is critical, policymakers must jettison the deeply held view that governments should not pick winners and that market outcomes are Panglossian in nature—the best of all possible worlds. Markets might optimize per-capita GDP growth (although even here, there are market failures that suggest some government intervention is needed to maximize per-capita GDP growth), but only by luck and happenstance will this generate the power-industry capabilities the United States needs to maintain superiority over China. There is no inherent reason why the United States will produce telecom equipment, semiconductors, electronic displays, circuit boards, and more. And even with robust defense spending, weakness in dual-use and enabling industries would undermine the defense sector, requiring massively larger defense budgets to produce the weapons systems the Department of Defense (DOD) needs in specialized factories with limited economies of scale. Markets, for all their value, are happy to enable the production of financial advisors, legal services, and high-end garments, while allowing dual-use sectors to wither and die in the face of subsidized Chinese production. This is true even with a robust national manufacturing strategy, which might end up with more production of shoes, golf clubs, and two-by-fours, but not optics, machine tools, and lasers, which weapons systems need. Policymakers already understand this when it comes to the production of weapons such as fighter aircraft and guns. While private companies make these, they do so under government contracts. It’s time to extend that thinking to dual-use and enabling industries too—not that in all or even most cases would these industries be supported by government contracts. But in all cases, there should be well-crafted and effectively implemented government strategies to ensure continued dynamic capabilities in national power industries. The implications of this simple yet profoundly important change in thought are significant. In short, it is time for the United States government to craft a coherent power industry strategy. No, this does not mean state socialism or crony capitalism and Solyndra. No, it does not mean corporate welfare. But it does require embracing the concept of national power industry strategy, some of which, as described ahead, can be built on the insights from the scholarly and professional literature on corporate strategy. Despite what some free-market conservatives argue, America’s economic and trade policies have not been consistent since the founding of the Republic. Rather, key inflection points have occurred, leading to new beliefs, institutional arrangements, and policies. And each time, America’s leaders have made the right choice, although often through trial and error and incremental adjustments. But the transformations have been made that have enabled a more powerful and wealthier nation. It’s worth reviewing these historical pivots. From its colonial founding until the second war with the British (the War of 1812), American leaders largely saw the colonies and then the nation as a peripheral, natural resource economy, dependent on Britain for trade in manufactured goods that were to be paid for through exports of staples (wood, fish, tobacco, furs, etc.). After the revolution, some, such as Alexander Hamilton, recognized that this was fundamentally a relationship of dependency. That is why he “believed that in industry lay our great national destiny.” [9] He did not want America to remain a “hewer of wood and drawer of water.” Indeed, he argued that government should “cultivate particular branches of trade ... and to discourage others.” [10] That’s why America’s first successful manufacturing firm, the Society of Useful Manufacturers, was funded by the state of New Jersey and leading American financiers that Hamilton convinced to fund it. Even Jefferson embraced national developmentalism, including protective tariffs. [11] As president, his goal was to repay the national debt and then use the revenues to fund “rivers, canals, roads, arts, manufacturers, education and other great objects.” [12] He “encouraged new branches of industry that may be advantageous to the public, either by offering premiums for discoveries, or by purchasing from their proprietors such inventions as shall appear to be of immediate and general utility, and rendering them free to the citizens at large.” [13] But it wasn’t until the shock of the war of 1812 that a true consensus for industrial development emerged. Indeed, in 1816 Jefferson wrote, “You tell me I am quoted by those who wish to continue our dependence on England for manufactures. There was a time when I might have been so quoted with more candor, but within the 30 years, which have since elapsed, how are circumstances changed!” [14] Jefferson was a man who was willing to change his thinking when conditions required doing so. Indeed, the war broadened and heightened calls for more efforts to develop American industry. Henry Clay and other Whigs devised “the American System,” consisting of tariffs to protect and promote industry; a national bank to foster commerce; and federal subsidies for roads, canals, and other domestic improvements. The latter also involved subsidies to targeted industries, including at the state government level. When running in 1832 as a Whig, Abraham Lincoln stated, “[M]y politics are short and sweet, like the old woman’s dance. I am in favor of a national bank ... in favor of the internal improvements system, and a high protective tariff.” [15] These changes enabled the development of American industries, many driven by waterpower, including textiles, muskets and rifles, shipbuilding, and others. The next pivot was the Civil War. This time the core change domestically was whether the United States would fully embrace industrialization to become a world power, with the centralization of power and high tariff walls that entailed. Or would it allow industrialization to occur at its own pace with much of the U.S. economy maintained as an agrarian and plantation export economy. Southern plantation states opposed this mission and the institutional changes that it entailed, in part because it meant higher prices for what farmers consumed and reduced overseas markets for what they sold. The Civil War made the choice inexorable, and with the victory of the Northern States, the United States proceeded to industrialize at a rapid rate behind a high tariff wall and with the support of defense industry purchases. Indeed, for the rest of that century, the United States was the China of its day: an economy in which industrialization was everything and growth was off the charts. This led European countries to despair. As David Kedrosky wrote: Frederick Arthur McKenzie’s The American Invaders and WT Stead’s The Americanization of the World (both 1901) were just two of an avalanche of publications advertising the rot of Britain and the inevitability of its supersession by its youthful, vigorous former colony. Economists cast about for something, or someone, to blame. [16] He went on to cite leading British economists Alfred Marshall, who sounded the alarm in 1903 (wish that we had more Alfred Marshalls today in the United States): Sixty years ago England had leadership in most branches of industry. It was inevitable that she should cede much to the great land which attracts alert minds of all nations to sharpen their inventive and resourceful faculties by impact on one another. It was inevitable that she should yield a little of it to that land of great industrial traditions which yoked science in the service of man with unrivalled energy. It was not inevitable that she should lose so much of it as she has done. [17] The next major pivot came with the American victory in WWII and then the rise of an aggressive and expansive Marxist-Leninist Soviet Union. After WWII, the forces for returning to the pre-war status quo were strong. In 1946, Truman’s State of the Union speech called for bringing most troops home and demobilizing. [18] And his economic policy was to continue New Deal social programs but embrace Keynesian cycle management. But it was only after Soviet expansionism into Eastern Europe, the development in 1947 of the “Truman Doctrine,” a few years later Stalin giving the green light for Kim Il Sung to invade South Korea, and seven years later the Soviets launching Sputnik that America responded with overwhelming force. The United States chose to assume leadership of the free world, in part because of the fall of the British Empire and the benefits that came with hegemony, but also become someone needed to stop Soviet expansionism. Indeed, NSC-162-2, a new national security policy generated through the Solarium project initiated by President Eisenhower, argued for a new approach to national policy to address the Soviet threat. [19] Among other things, it called for, “in the face of the Soviet threat, the security of the United States requires … A mobilization base, and its protection against crippling damage, adequate to insure victory in the event of general war.” This new strategic approach meant several things: first, the rejection of tariffs and the embrace of free trade and global integration, in part to ensure more stable democracies around the world aligned with the United States, because at home, the Cold War meant unprecedented massive funding for science and technology. Second, starting in WWII, the federal government dramatically ramped up its support for advanced industry. By the early 1960s, it spent more on research and development (R&D) than the rest of the world combined. [20] That fueled an enormous array of breakthroughs, including computers, semiconductors, jet aviation, lasers, numerically controlled machine tools, satellites, relational databases, and of course, the Internet. Indeed, NSC-162-2 called the United States to “[c]onduct and foster scientific research and development so as to insure superiority in quantity and quality of weapons systems, with attendant continuing review of the level and composition of forces and the industrial base required for adequate defense and successful prosecution of general war.” [21] Starting in WWII, the federal government dramatically ramped up its support for advanced industry. By the early 1960s, it spent more on R&D than the rest of the world combined. Turning points are hard. There is a reason societies establish routines, fixed institutions, and common rules. Changing them is hard. Vested interests oppose them. Few experts have the intellectual fortitude to challenge their own frameworks. Voters get comfortable with the status quo. And democratic politics makes change hard. But as history shows, when the disjuncture between external reality and internal frameworks and approaches becomes wide enough, America has been able to successfully embrace pivot points. Perhaps the most important question facing the nation today is, does the U.S. political economy have the capability, absent a military conflict with China, to make the needed changes? The final part of this report examines this question. After the Soviet threat evaporated in the early 1990s, American leadership assumed that the United States was not only in a unipolar moment, but that, as Francis Fukayama argued, history itself had ended. [22] In other words, Western liberal democratic capitalism had triumphed over all. If he had in fact been correct, there would be no need to write this report, as China would be well on the way to a free-market democracy. But also, he and most others were so enthused by the collapse of the Soviet Union that enthusiasm overrode reality. As a result, the ideological and policy ideas that went with this phase have not only remained as core to U.S. techno-economic and trade governance, but at least until recently, become even more embedded in American thinking. Since America won, there was and is no real historical turning point other than one that reinforced the primacy of the U.S. system. Four core ideas remain. First, it is America’s role to advance free trade and globalization even if it was not in our narrow interest. Free trade, especially other nations selling to America, helped ensure that they entered the American orbit and not the Soviet one or remained unaligned. The U.S. economy was so strong that it could afford uneven trading arrangements. Indeed, until the early 1970s, the U.S. economy enjoyed trade surpluses. Later, as those surpluses turned to trade deficits and the United States became the importer of last resort, the view was that the U.S. economy was still the strongest, and besides, trade deficits not only didn’t matter, but they were also a reflection of economic strength. Ahh, the power of wishful thinking. On top of that was the pervasive idea held by the foreign policy establishment and economists that not only was all trade good, but so too was the movement of U.S. business operations overseas. Indeed, a 2013 survey of Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) members found that 73 percent believed that the U.S. economy would be strengthened if more U.S. companies set up operations overseas. In contrast, just 23 percent of the U.S. public believed this. [23] One is reminded of William Buckely’s quip that he would rather live in a society governed by the first 2,000 names in the Boston phone book than one governed by 2,000 Harvard faculty members. [24] Also, 52 percent of CFR members predicted that China would become more democratic by 2023 and 34 percent thought China would be a key future ally by then. President Xi, did you see this survey? If so, why did you not go along with the CFR folks? As surpluses turned to trade deficits and the United States became the importer of last resort, the view was that the U.S. economy was still the strongest, and besides, trade deficits not only didn’t matter, but they were also a reflection of economic strength. Following in the intellectual path set by classical economist David Ricardo, the consensus view became that trade was always win-win, and there was a comparative advantage wherever a nation’s industrial structure was based on—unless distorted by suboptimal government policies—inherent natural comparative advantages. Not only was there no reason for government to alter “natural” industrial structure, but it was also welfare reducing to do so. Moreover, to the extent there were foreign deviations from free trade, they were seen as barriers and distortions that hurt the countries putting them in place, not as attacks on U.S. companies and the U.S. economy. In this regard, free trade is seen as a natural phenomenon producing natural and superior results. The fact that most of the rest of the world neither believed nor practiced this only reinforced the messianic mission of America to teach the heathens the errors of their ways and convert them to the free trade religion. Second, what ultimately buttressed this the way free booze buttresses an alcoholic was the fact that the U.S. dollar was the reserve currency. The dollar was accepted everywhere, and ultimately, if the United States needed more dollars, unlike any other nation, it could simply print more. This is termed the “exorbitant privilege” that let the United States run massive trade deficits for decades. In realty, it was not a privilege but an albatross around America’s neck, allowing policymakers to be indifferent to structural trade deficits. With such massive trade deficits, any other nation would have had to devalue its currency and grow its exports and reduce imports. But not the United States. And so, U.S. manufacturing, including national power industries, shrank. And because there was no real consequence to this—foreign nations continued to pour money into the United States, in part to keep their currency values low and exports high—it was easy for American pundits and experts to ignore and deny the decay of American power industry capabilities. Indeed, most to this day still defend the reserve currency status of the dollar as a key source of national power, instead of what it really is: a cancer on national power industry competitiveness. Third, because the techno-economic power imbalance between the United States and the Soviets was so large, there was no need for a strategic industry policy. The Soviets might have had a peer-competitor military, but they by no means had a peer-competitor set of national power industries. And one reason was that Soviet command economics, unlike Chinese state capitalism, was incredibly limiting. Soviet Gosplan was in fact a central planner and allocator of goods and services. Fourth, science and technology proceeded from funding to scientists to pursue basic research in whatever areas they chose (what FDR science advisor Vannevar Bush laid out as the linear model of basic science to commercial production) and company-funded research based on market forces alone. This meant that just as “computer chips, potato chips what’s the difference?” prevailed in economic thinking, “astrophysics, quantum physics what’s the difference?” prevailed in science funding. In other words, the United States was so far ahead of other nations in science that it had the luxury of funding a large share of the world’s basic, exploratory research that other nations used to build their advanced industry export economies. As such, neoclassical, non-goal-oriented economic policy became accepted as all-time truth. It was true everywhere and always. Short-run efficiency generated from market actors operating in response to market-determined price signals was the lode star. Externalities, with perhaps the exception of pollution, were few and far between, and government’s efforts to intervene in this natural, indeed beautiful, process were, by definition, welfare-reducing. This truth still dominates U.S. expert, pundit, and policymaker thinking. An emblematic example is a Washington Post op-ed excoriating President Trump’s conditioning CHIPS Act grant funding to Intel on the federal government getting an ownership share. Yes, this was a bad decision, but not because it violated free-market dogma, but because it ultimately weakened Intel, clearly a power industry company. [25] The Post’s statement is a perfect reflection of what current U.S. consensus is regarding techno-economic and trade policy where power industry concerns are nonexistent: This deal is the culmination of America’s resurgent interest in industrial policy, the same interest we always develop when we sense a challenge to our global economic dominance. Whenever we spot a new competitor on the horizon, we look wistfully at China — or Germany, or Japan — and wonder if it’s a mistake to let the market decide what America produces. Maybe we should learn a lesson from the competition and let the government, with its deep pockets and longer time-horizons, take a bigger role in shaping the economy. This particular policy also risks distorting the free-market system that has delivered better results for America, and the world, than any state-managed competitor has ever achieved. And it is unlikely to fix the deep problems with Intel, which have been decades in the making. There is an argument for industrial policy in strategically vital products. The United States does not want to source critical defense inputs from geostrategic rivals. But that argument only works if you make three dubious assumptions: that the government can confine its efforts to strategically important industries (rather than, say, bailing out failing automakers with politically powerful unions); that it can spend the money wisely (rather than wasting huge sums on efforts that sounded better to planners than to buyers); and that the companies that find themselves showered with money will use it to turn themselves into globally competitive superstars, rather than to maintain a lackluster operation thanks to the subsidies. [26] A few years ago, this op-ed would have been exactly the same, but without the reference to the need for “strategically vital products.” At least now elite discourse has to include a passing reference to this, before it then breezes on praising the wonders of the free market. There is one final component of the America’s techno-economic and trade doctrine, one that did not emerge until the fall of the Soviet Union: American hubris. In its close, the op-ed at least considers that it might be necessary for the United States to have strong national power industries, but the authors still couldn’t help themselves and fall back into conventional thinking, claiming that the old model actually works when it comes to national power industries. Government, it claims: can also work harder on improving infrastructure and fixing government policies that drive up manufacturing costs, such as land-use regulations and taxes. But the United States should not try to beat China by becoming China. We should compete the way we always have: by relying on the free enterprise system that has served us so well for so long. [27] If this is not a rejection of the need for a doctrinal shift in response to an historical turning point, I don’t know what is. There is one final component of the America’s techno-economic and trade doctrine, one that did not emerge until the fall of the Soviet Union: American hubris. At least during the Cold War, leaders on both sides of the aisle were worried about the Soviet challenge, not just militarily but also technologically, especially in the 1950s and 1960s as Soviet space and nuclear technology advanced. In hindsight, the technology threat was overstated, but nonetheless, policymakers remained apprehensive, ever focused on maintaining our lead. Now, absent that threat, America suffers from what Chinese political economist Heng-Fu Zou calls “status-quo-based optimism.” [28] In other words, too many U.S. experts and policymakers still see the world as it was from 1990 to the mid-2000s when the belief was that United States was preeminent in virtually everything. Communism had been defeated and was consigned to the dustbin of history. China was a poor, developing market economy, not a development-oriented Marxist-Leninist dictatorship. And emerging signs that China might be becoming a peer competitor were almost completely ignored by the expert class, so much so that individuals and organizations that tried to issue warnings were dismissed as cranks. Case in point: the U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission, an entity created by Congress as a sop to those worried about the effects of letting China in the World Trade Organization (WTO) . For years, the view in Washington was that these were a bunch of crazed China hawks and it was largely frowned upon for experts to testify in front of this commission. Because the United States had vanquished its foes and stood tall and unopposed (except by jihadists that turned airplanes into missiles), that meant, by definition, that the current techno-economic and trade system was optimal. It had led to the prosperous and strong America. No one could touch us. So why challenge what had worked so well? This is perhaps the driving factor in why so many in the expert and political classes are so closed to considering new techno-economic and trade frameworks. The old/current system worked great. Why fix it if it ain’t broke? Accepting realities would mean a weakening of the foundations of the tripartite American techno-economic and trade doctrine: free trade, free markets, and reserve currency. That doctrine, and the professional reputations built upon it, must, at all costs, be defended. And it is also why so many in the expert and political classes are almost completely impervious to data suggesting that reality no longer exists, especially the increasingly obvious Chinese techno-economic rise and the concomitant American decline, as well as Xi’s Marxist-Leninist global hegemonic aspirations. Reams of data showing China’s techno-economic rise are ignored or denied, as is data showing U.S. decline. Well, the data must be wrong. Or China is different. Or the data doesn’t apply to the United States. Besides, we all know that China has a host of short-term business cycle challenges (e.g., housing glut), so no need to consider structural change. A bit more science spending, some regulatory tweaks, and some more high-skilled immigration and all will be ship-shape. Accepting these realities would mean a weakening of the foundations of the tripartite American techno-economic and trade doctrine: free trade, free markets, and reserve currency. That doctrine, and the professional reputations built upon it, must, at all costs, be defended. In other words, the consensus among the elite class is that the current system suffices. However, what is striking about past fundamental pivots in American techno-economic and trade systems is that all were in response to war: the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812; the Civil War; and WWII and the Korean War. Before each of these conflicts, the consensus view was for the then current system. Few policymakers and elites had any real desire to change, and those that did were in the minority with no real power. It was the shock and destruction of war that made the rejection of the old system and the embrace of a new system a virtual requirement. Today, without a great-power war to spur change, there is little that is doing so. The Chinese national power trade attacks are not major battles, but rather a constant drip-drip of allied and U.S. losses that are either overlooked or rationalized as inconsequential. Better to defend the tripartite system of free trade, free-market economics, and reserve dollar and attack or ignore anyone who has the temerity to challenge it. Better to attack Trump as a clueless protectionist rather than to acknowledge that his concerns, if not necessarily his policies, reflect a new reality. It is possible that a People’s Republic of China (PRC) invasion of Taiwan might produce such a motive force. But it might not because U.S. leaders and the public could just give up and either not intervene or intervene but quickly withdraw after casualty numbers go up and missile stocks go down. If the PRC were smart and understood America, it would bide its time (it can no longer hide its light) until its GDP and power industry and military capabilities significantly outweigh those of the United States and the West. If it invaded then, even if the shock of war and defeat were enough to highlight the defects of the current system and motivate the embrace of a new one, it would be too late to do anything meaningful. U.S. and allied techno-organizational capabilities for renewal, including an existing advanced industrial base, would be below what is needed. As discussed ahead, the barriers to entry in most of these complex and capital-intensive industries would be too high. Even if the American populace and the elite class came together with a massive Sputnik-like movement and responded, the amount of effort and money needed to rebuild would be enormous. And so t he techno-economic war would be over, and the United States would have lost most of its national power industry capabilities with virtually no way to get them back, akin to the United Kingdom after WWII. All the United Kingdom can do now is show nostalgic TV shows on BBC about when Britannia ruled the world. Box 1: Britain’s Failure to Grasp Its Turning Point Like America, Britain faced a turning point during and after WWII, but unlike the United States, it failed to successfully turn, resulting in the permanent (at least to today), long-term deindustrialization and decline of the United Kingdom. In his masterful book The Audit of War: The Illusion and Reality of Britain as a Great Nation, British historian Correlli Barnett documented the failures and why. [29] Like noted industrial historian Alfred Chandler, Barnett argued that British industry did not succeed in emulating American mass production and the management that went along with it. As Elbaum and Lazonick wrote: Successful capitalist development in twentieth century German, Japan and the United States demonstrates the ubiquitous importance of the visible hand of corporate bureaucratic management. To meet with international challenge, British industries required transformation of their strategies of industrial relations, industrial organization, and enterprise management. Vested interests in the old structures, however, proved formidable obstacles to the old transition from competitive to corporate modes of organization. [30] The result was significant lags in productivity and quality of manufactured goods, especially compared with Germany and the United States. And in many areas, Britain was completely dependent on other nations. For example, during the war, Britain was totally reliant on the United States for over 20 kinds of machine tools it had never been able to make itself. [31] Some of this was due to poor management; many firms were still family owned and modest in size. Much of it was due to strong labor unions and their utter opposition to the kinds of industrial organization and job change that would be required to boost efficiency to be able to compete internationally. It would have been one thing if Britain were losing its old industries but at least gained the new ones, such as chemicals, electronics, and aerospace. But it failed there as well, in part because of the persistence of the craft industry, as opposed to mass production—and also because the government spent so little on R&D. At the same time, the schools and university system, unlike that of Germany and the United States, focused on traditional education, especially learning the classics, and neglected both skilled-trades education and STEM education. It wasn’t that certain groups and individuals in government were not aware of these challenges. Some were and proposed fairly far-reaching industrial policy changes that, if implemented, would have certainly reduced the scope and scale of deindustrialization and lack of progress in emerging science-based industries. But at a political economy level, there were three forces that meant failure. The first was the long-standing British free-market ideology, especially among economists that eschewed any more than minimal government role in restructuring industry. And the Conservative Party’s top priority was on “sound finance” and free trade. And many economists opposed scrapping out-of-date industrial machinery until that had been completely depreciated and was no longer working. The second was the rise of the Labour Party and its massive embrace of what Barnett has called “The New Jerusalem”: the idea that the state would provide a new almost utopian life for British citizens through public spending. Based in part on the 1942 “Beverage Report,” which called for “cradle to grave” public support, including national health insurance, massive housing spending, and more money on education, the new Labour government under Atlee saw this as its overwhelming task to implement these wartime proposals. Indeed, the view of many was that Britain deserved this after its all-out fight to defeat Hitler. As Barnett wrote, “New Jerusalem was their [British ‘enlightened’ establishment Party officials] high-minded gift which they proceeded successfully to press on the British people between 1940 and 1945, with far-reaching effects on the British people’s postwar chances as an industrial power struggling for survival and prosperity.” [32] This massive new social services spending campaign crowded up virtually all needed public investment to be able to compete. It was not that the officials didn’t know that this would cost a lot of money. Rather, as Barnett wrote, they pursued this vision “on the best romantic principle that sense must bend to feeling, and facts to faith,” much like American conservatives and liberals push for tax cuts and spending increases, respectively, even when the till is empty. [33] And ironically, the factor that held both the Conservative and Labour views together was the still prevalent individualism over communitarianism. School reform was based on freedom for the individual, rather than on what would boost national power. Spending was based on satisfying immediate needs, rather than boosting national power in the medium term. As a result, national investment was minimal, just one-third of post-war Germany levels. In summary, Barnett stated, “If Britain after the war was to earn the immense resources required to maintain her cherished traditional place as a great power and at the same time to pay for New Jerusalem at home, she had to achieve nothing short of an economic miracle. Such a miracle could only be wrought through the transformation, material and human, of her essentially obsolete industrial society into one capable of triumphing in the world markets of the future.” [34] Had all the most powerful groups and institutions in that society enthusiastically been willing to throw themselves behind the process of transformation, it still would have been difficult enough to achieve, given the scale of inherited problems. But instead of such willingness, there existed massive inertial resistance to change, which was so manifest in the history of Briain as an industrial society; a resistance that not even the shock of war had proved strong enough to budge more than a little. [35] What does this all mean then? First and foremost, it means that the core challenge for America is wholesale abandonment of the post-war free-trade comparative advantage, free-market, and reserve currency doctrines and practices, and their replacement with doctrines and practices fitted for U.S.-China power industry conflict, as discussed ahead. But the reality is that the preservation of U.S. and allied techno-economic power needs to take center stage in American politics and government. As Chinese scholar Heng-Fu Zou wrote in an article modeling China-U.S. great power competition, “Power is not a neutral consequence of growth, but a strategic externality. As a result, national welfare depends negatively on rival strength, even absent direct miliary confrontation.” [36] He went on to argue, “This provides formal justification for industrial policies aimed at limiting rival capacity … These policies are rational from a strategic welfare standpoint, even if they reduce short-run efficiency.” [37] His last point is one that simply cannot be understood by most America economists who see reducing short-run efficiency as the height of economic stupidity. Compared with China, the Soviet Union was a pre-season warm-up game in the minor leagues. Sure, it had military strength, including a powerful nuclear arsenal. But it’s ability to degrade America’s techno-economic strength was minimal and its ability to generate its own strength was even less. At the same time, proactive domestic policies are needed. As Zho has stated, “Without proactive [U.S.] efforts to rebuild internal economic structure—both material (capital, factories, supply chains) and immaterial (skills, institutional memory, R&D ecosystems)—the relative power dynamic will continue to tilt toward China.” [38] Given today’s reality of China’s rise and America’s decline, this should be so obvious that it need not even be stated. But alas, it is not and so it needs to be asserted. Zou summed it up: Strategic rivalry in the 21st century is driven not only by military buildup or ideological narratives, but by underlying economic flows, learning dynamics and structural investments. Geopolitical outcomes are endogenous to trade, production and policy strategy. For the United States, reversing strategic decline will require more than tactical trade defense [e.g., tariffs]; it will require a coordinated industrial renaissance. [39] This reality should be extremely sobering. Compared with China, the Soviet Union was a pre-season warm-up game in the minor leagues. Sure, it had military strength, including a powerful nuclear arsenal. But it’s ability to degrade America’s techno-economic strength was minimal and its ability to generate its own strength was even less, even as it engaged in massive IP spying and buying capabilities from the Europeans, who like today, were always willing to make a euro, even if it meant enabling an adversary. Maybe Lenin was thinking of them when he said, “the capitalists will sell us the rope by which we will hang them.” [40] By the early 1980s, U.S. techno-economic dominance over the Soviet Union had become increasingly apparent to U.S. policymakers. [41] As such, that conflict was largely about military capability and convincing the rest of the world that the capitalist, democratic system was superior to the socialist, authoritarian one. That was as easy as arguing that Micheal Jordan was better than an NBA player coming off the bench. China is the finals of the major league. What is China? That is the key question to answer. Much of the need to adopt a new techno-economic and trade doctrine depends on a simple question of what China is and what it wants to accomplish. The conventional view among most U.S. foreign policy experts is that it is a normal capitalist nation (albeit an authoritarian one) that just wants to develop as other developing nations have; or as some will admit, it just wants to have strategic independence from the United States. The reality is that view is deeply naïve. The Chinese government is not a “normal” developing nation seeking growth, or even a fifth “Asian Tiger” seeking to rapidly move up the value chain through exports. China is a Marxist-Leninist dictatorship seeking global techno-economic domination by growing its own firms in virtually all emerging and foundational advanced technology industries. The intended casualty is the global market share and even the survival of Western and U.S. firms and industries. China’s arsenal includes an array of weapons, including massive subsidies, IP theft, standards manipulation, closed domestic markets, and the incorporation into the Chinese orbit of an array of developing economies. China is not a free trader or a protectionist, the only categories available for Western discourse. Rather, drawing on historical parallels, namely Albert Hirschman’s account of pre-war German economic policy, China’s subsidies, market closing, intellectual-property coercion, and overcapacity dumping are neither accidental nor benign. They revive the notion that trade can be weaponized, a concept powerfully elaborated by Farrell and Newman in “Weaponized Interdependence.” [42] China is a “power trader” rather than a mere beneficiary of globalization, and that means we need to realign the policy debate toward defense of critical industries that enable national power and away from simplistic free trade versus protectionism binaries. A key CCP weapon is flooding foreign markets with lower-priced products in order to capture market share from foreign leaders. Many trade experts refer to this process as Chinese overcapacity, as if this is simply an unexpected effect of the various forces at work in the Chinese economy. In reality, product “dumping” is a conscious decision at the core of the Chinese strategy of capturing global market share. Chinese companies are able to price below costs because they are subsidized by the state (and enjoy other cost advantages). And they know that companies in capitalist economies will not have the patience to suffer losses for more than a short period, after which they will cede market share and reallocate their capital to higher profit activities, including going bankrupt and returning capital to shareholders, or if they could get USG approval, selling their assets to a Chinese company. The CCP also knows that, for the most part, foreign governments have neither the fiscal capability nor the political will to subsidize their companies’ losses. And so, the bulldozer of value destruction keeps coming. We have already seen the results in an array of industries, including telecom equipment, commercial drones, solar panels, shipbuilding, bulk chemicals, LCD displays, and many others. And China is continuing to attack across a wide array of industries and technologies, including semiconductor memory and logic, biopharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, EVs and batteries, quantum computing, AI, aerospace, and others. If the United States, and the West more broadly, allows China to weaken and even destroy much of our advanced industry, America will look like the UK—largely an industrial and technology wasteland—and China will be the most powerful nation on earth, with attendant economic, military, and foreign policy consequences. China is a Marxist-Leninist dictatorship seeking global techno-economic domination by growing its own firms in virtually all emerging and foundational advanced technology industries. The intended casualty is the global market share and even the survival of Western and U.S. firms and industries. History has seen other campaigns such as this. From the late 1800s to World War II, Germany illustrated how trade could be weaponized into “an instrument of power, of pressure and even of conquest,” wrote the development economist Albert O. Hirschman. [43] Like China, Germany mostly focused on importing goods needed for its war machine, redirected trade to friendly or subject nations and sought to control oceanic trade routes, all in an effort to limit development of its adversaries. Like China, the German government kept its currency undervalued (making its goods relatively cheaper for consumers in other countries), leveraged the use of tariffs and subsidized its exports to bolster its position in industry goods such as steel, chemicals and machinery. If China was a “normal” country, focused on democracy, free trade, and generally market-oriented policies, there would be no need for this conversation. But China is not a normal country in the context of most other nations. First, despite what its leaders might present to the West, it is a Marxist-Leninist state. [44] After Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s, the CCP did not make the fatal mistakes the Soviets made of seeking a command economy where the state allocated resources. But it did not seek a market economy either. The CCP knew and knows what it wants the economy to evolve to—which, frankly, is not hard to know given a more than rudimentary understanding of industry and technology—and it sets directions. But, unlike the Soviets with their central planning from agencies such as Gosplan, the CCP lets companies do the rowing to get to the intended destination. The government’s job is to provide companies with a massive amount of help, including weakening their foreign competitors. Second, China has an overall power industry strategy, as well as scores if not hundreds of strategies for particular industries and technologies (e.g., medical devices). Because of that, most economic players row in the same direction. Local and provincial governments, financiers, companies, and entrepreneurs—they all are attuned to the direction CCP leadership wants them to go and, while there are certainly tensions and often massive waste (which Chinese citizens pay for with their underconsumption), there are also massive victories. Third, unlike the West, and particularly the Anglo-American West, China’s focus is not on the individual. Americans are bombarded on a daily basis with how this or that policy will affect their welfare as consumers (“Trump tariffs will raise prices!”), investors (“Trump tariffs will lower stock prices!”), workers (“AI will kill jobs!”), and residents (“These wind turbines will make noise!”). And the national interest is relegated to the bottom of the list, if it is even considered. Indeed, in this framing, there is no national interest, only the aggregate voices of individual interests as consumers, investors, workers and residents. As such, if something is good for the nation but raises prices, lowers stock values, eliminates jobs, or disrupts a neighborhood, it is, by definition, bad. Just as the U.S. economics profession embraced Ricardian trade theory and free-market economics, the U.S. political science profession, especially after the 1950s, embraced the theory of pluralism that held that the public interests was just the amalgam of competing interests. Academics such as Charles Lindblom, David Truman, and Robert Dahl led that charge. When a nation has to operate with those constraints, it is amazing that anything gets done other than what the most powerful forces can force through. If the United States, and the West more broadly, allows China to weaken and even destroy much of our advanced industry, America will look like the United Kingdom—largely an industrial and technology wasteland—and China will be the most powerful nation on earth, with attendant economic, military, and foreign policy consequences. On top of that, the overriding U.S. focus is on consumer orientation, what Keynes termed as “more jam today.” Harvard’s Bruce Scottt wrote in 1997 that “policies that favor consumption, consumer borrowing, and leisure are components of a consumer orientation. Public provision of enhanced economic security is also a consumer-oriented notion; it allows consumers to take less responsibility for themselves, and thus to leverage a given level of income with additional debt.” [45] We have only doubled down on that since Scott wrote those words, cutting taxes, massively expanding entitlements, and slashing true public investments. Lots of jam! China doesn’t worry about that. The CCP runs things—not investors, not consumers, not workers, and not residents. Chinese citizens can’t vote and have almost no voice in whether the CCP immiserates them in order to win the bigger, longer-term techno-economic war. Take peasants’ land to build a port? No problem. Keep the value of the RMB currency low so consumers pay more for imports? No problem. Put the pedal to the metal with robotic and other forms of automation, even if workers lose their jobs? No problem. The CCP doesn’t privilege self-interested individuals or organizations over the country as a whole, and as a result, it has much more smooth sailing to boost its national power industries. China has a producer orientation. As Scott wrote about Asian nations such as South Korea: [They are ]built on the notion of increased resource mobilization so as to have … “more jam tomorrow.” Producer-oriented nations favor saving and investment, technology acquisition, and skills upgrading through education and training, all of which imply less jam today as well as more tomorrow. In addition to increased resource mobilization, producer-oriented societies are characterized by market structures—capital, product, and labor—that permit producer institutions, firms, and associations to hold a great deal of power, while restricting that allowed to labor as well as to consumers. [46] To be clear, the United States should not adopt a repressive government. But Americans need to dial back selfishness and embrace more civic virtue, ending the focus on “more jam today” and replacing it with “more jam tomorrow.” Fourth, while America prioritizes allocation efficiency, the CCP prioritizes effectiveness of actions leading to increased industrial power. American elites see markets as an end because markets optimize efficiency. The CCP sees markets as just one of many tools to achieve its goal: global dominance in national power industries. That orientation is better for winning great power competition because markets are largely indifferent to winning or losing that competition. Markets are not indifferent to maximizing wealth, at least in the short run. But power and wealth are quite different things. And an economy that boasts the world’s most efficient personal services, utilities, hotel and lodging, and FIRE (finance, insurance, and real estate) sectors might be the richest. But an economy that can boast the largest national power industries will be the most powerful. Fifth, a key difference between China and the United States is an obvious one: China is not a democracy. The lack of democratic constraints on government means that the CCP can afford to spend enormous sums (direct and indirect tax expenditures) on supporting Chinese national power industries. Chinese citizens surely have some pain point over taxes, but it is clearly considerably lower than Americans’ pain point, as U.S. voters will go the ramparts if the gas tax is even indexed to inflation or if a politician even says they have considered a minor reduction in entitlements. America needs to stop focusing on “more jam today” and instead focus on “more jam tomorrow.” Sixth, like the Asian tigers (e.g., Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan) Chinese officials are steeped in the discipline of industrial and technology policy. Yes, there is scholarly industrial policy discipline to study, and it is largely ignored in the Anglo-Saxon and most European nations. However, Chinese officials study it intently. Most have read the “Adam Smith” of national developmentalism, Friedrich List, even if few American economists even know who he is. [47] In contrast, the level of education and knowledge of national developmentalism in the United States is minimal, with national policymakers usually having backgrounds in law. And economics does not involve the study of industry or technology, but rather how price-mediated markets work. And elite economists and policymakers look with disdain at the field of industrial policy and national developmentalism, if they even deign themselves to notice it at all. Seventh, Chinese governments support industrial policy research and analysis. The USG does not, and its economic statistics and technology system is designed to support market analysis and business cycle management, not power industry policy. And of course, every year, this system gets weaker with budget cuts. China also has a multitude of different agencies and bureaus to implement power industry policies. And we see that with the range of sophisticated techno-industrial policies, including China’s large and well-funded network of manufacturing innovation centers. [48] The United States has barely a few, some at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and DOD, but that is about it. Eighth, China sees itself in great power industry competition. Party congresses focus on this. Party newspapers constantly discuss it. Chinese leaders constantly discuss it. The United States largely does not. Most of the U.S. trade experts see trade as Ricardian win-win with countries not competing with each other. Trade policy is to reduce barriers to let markets become more efficient. To the extent elites consider U.S. competitiveness, most believe that we are far ahead of the Chinese and always will be because market economies produce superior outcomes compared with state-directed economies. Or, like Paul Krugman and so many other conventional economists, they deny that the United States competes at all with other economies. Hot-button issues of abortion, immigration, culture wars, health care, and the like, as well as inflation and stock prices, take up the attention of most U.S. policymakers. Ninth, Chinese officials are pragmatic. If letting companies have more leeway achieves CCP goals, they are for it. If winning requires more state involvement or even control, they are for that. In contrast, it is U.S. officials who are the ideologues. The CHIPS Act is opposed by the Right because it is too much government involvement. The Left opposes it because it commits the sin of helping corporations. Trump’s efforts to take equity share in companies are opposed, not because it might not lead to increased national power, but because it violates free-market principles. This ideological nature of U.S. thinking is why so many U.S. experts disparage China, as well as the very need for national power industries. If national power industries are important and if China is outperforming the United States, that poses a direct challenge to current trade and economic ideologies. This is why so many pundits have been arguing that we have seen “Peak China.” That way “nothing to see here, move on.” No need to do the painful examination of whether our current system works or needs a historic transformation. But Peak China is a fantasy; nothing could be farther than the truth. The demographic challenge they point to won’t really kick in for another decade or so as smaller, younger cohorts move into mid-career roles. Besides, there is every reason to expect that Chinese productivity growth will continue to outpace population decline, as well as U.S. growth rates. The same with the housing bubble-induced fiscal crisis. That is a business cycle challenge, not a growth challenge. Brooks and Vagle dismiss China’s techno-economic challenge because U.S. companies account for a larger share of global profits than Chinese firms. [49] But that is misleading for two reasons. U.S. profits overseas, especially in China, provide little in the way of national power. Second, low profits are a CCP tactic that lets Chinese firms gain global market share. Indeed, as a McKinsey Global Institute report points out, “Simply put, US manufacturing companies are expected to produce higher returns on capital than their competitors in the OECD and China.” [50] If national power industries are important and if China is outperforming the United States, that poses a direct challenge to current trade and economic ideologies. Some rightly point out that CCP has its own innovation bottlenecks—constraints in extreme-ultraviolet lithography, gallium nitride substrates, or advanced gene-therapy commercialization—that could limit Beijing’s ability to sustain techno-war pressures. There is no question that this is true. China is not all-powerful. But the CCP is making massive efforts to either replace Western capabilities or innovate around them with fundamentally new-to-the-world capabilities. Tenth and finally, China’s rulers are much more unified on national goals. While there are divides within the CCP, although they are likely fewer after Xi’s purges, the divides are not really about overarching goal. That remains, as China scholar Orville Schell wrote, wealth and power. In this case, the power of being a rich global hegemon dominating advanced industries. [51] Any differences are about how to achieve that goal, with XI and his faction focused more on techno-economic aggression while any reformers still left focused on using slightly less aggressive policies so as to reduce Western pushback. There used to be more unanimity around U.S. national goals, which changed and emerged after each major historical pivot. In his book Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy , Bill Janeway discussed how America had national missions from its founding: the Hamiltonian mission of building the country to be independent of England, the mission from Lincoln to FDR to become a great world industrial power and tying the country together, and the post-World War II Soviet containment mission through military offset technology. [52] During the Cold War, there was broad-based bipartisan consensus about not letting the Soviets win, with some seeking a Kenan-like containment and others seeking a Reagan-like victory. But the goal was the same. Today, America no longer has a unifying national mission or interests to rally around other than, for the Right, freedom, and for the Left (along with many on the “New Right,” such as American Compass), equity and redistribution. And for many, the dominant mission now is fighting climate change. For others, it is fighting against the takeover of the world by super AI. And overall, self-interest not only runs amok, but also has become the new civic religion. China doesn’t care about any of these matters. It is time for another historical pivot point when America’s new national mission becomes not losing the national power industry war to China. Today, America no longer has a unifying national mission or interests to rally around other than, for the Right, freedom, and for the Left, equity and redistribution. As discussed in the next section, there is considerable difference of opinion among U.S. foreign policy experts regarding China’s goals, and even fundamental nature, and as such a variety of strategic directions for the United States are offered. To the extent experts acknowledge China’s power industry actions, the consensus view is that the CCP is focusing on advanced industries either because they simply want to catch up to the West as any developing nation wants to do or they are reacting to Trump’s trade aggression and therefore are seeking to legitimately derisk from the United States. Likewise, the consensus view is that the CCP is seeking a seat at the global table in order to influence global issues. Finally, many experts see the CCP as being more capitalist than communist, and that, as such, it is more of a “normal” country than a Marxist-Leninist one. There are two principal problems with the consensus view. First, the view is likely wrong, stemming from a combination of wishful thinking and long-term intellectual commitments to positions held years if not decades ago but are now outdated. The view that the CCP is truly a Marxist-Leninist regime seeking to be the global hegemon and impose its governance structure on the world is actually likely to be the more accurate one. Second, even if the odds are that the consensus view is the correct one, especially that China is not seeking power industry dominance, it leads to a set of policies that, if right, can lead to an adequate outcome, but if wrong, to U.S. decline and subservience. If this is the case, it makes the struggle for global advanced industry leadership not only more important, but also central to the outcome. Finally, some believe that China has no desire or interest in having its power industry firms replace U.S. (and allied) power industry firms because then the CCP would have no leverage over our firms because there would be vastly fewer firms that buy from China. But this misses the point. The point is CCP leverage over the nation as a whole, and if it controls power industries, it has enormous power over Western nations. To better understand the CCP, we can look both at what the CCP says, especially domestically, and what the CCP does in terms of its national power industries’ policies. Ultimately, only time will tell which view is correct. But one insight into which is correct—China as a normal developing country or China as a hegemonic Marxist-Leninist regime set on global dominance of national power industries—is to review CCP writings and speeches. As Charles Parton wrote for the U.K. Council on Geostrategy: Internally, when promulgating to its members the speeches of Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), party documents and instructions, the CCP speaks of an ideological struggle between systems in which the People’s Republic of China (PRC) will gain domination over the United States (US). Externally, its foreign propaganda system derides the notion of a new cold war, and speaks of ‘win-win’ or ‘a community with a shared future for mankind… The second narrative is what it puts out to party members for guidance and reassurance. It is this which better represents its true intentions and therefore to which foreign governments should pay attention. [53] Perhaps the best analysis of these documents and statements comes from Daniel Tobin , professor of Practice at the U.S. National Intelligence University. In a May 7, 2025, article entitled “The Persistent, Soaring Ambitions of Xi Jinping’s ‘New Era’ for China, Socialism, and the Globe,” Tobin analyzed party documents, including Xi Jinping speeches and statements. [54] He wrote: In recent years, a growing number of external observers have rediscovered the value of CCP leadership speeches and policy documents as a vehicle for understanding the PRC’s intentions and actions. This is indeed the correct starting place. Owing to the CCP’s Leninist heritage, it uses ideology expressed in these venues as its instrument to depict, modify, and mobilize around its long-term goals, view of the external environment, and the policies designed to navigate toward its objectives. [55] His analysis suggests that the U.S. consensus view of China is wrong, and that indeed the CCP is a Marxist-Leninist party intent on advancing socialism globally against Western capitalism and democracy. He quoted Chinese Leader Xi: “The very purpose of the Party in leading the Chinese people in revolution, development, and reform is to make the people prosperous and the country strong, and rejuvenate the Chinese nation.” Parton added: Since 1992, the CCP’s constitution has maintained that: “The general starting point and criteria for judging each item of the Party’s work are that it must benefit the development of the socialist productive forces, be conducive to increasing socialist China’s comprehensive national power, and help to improve the people’s living standards.” Comprehensive national power, then, is both an end and a means to achieving the PRC’s overall goal of “national rejuvenation” become “a country with leading comprehensive national power and international influence.” In other words, the goal is not just to become a developed, modern strong country in absolute terms, but also a leading country in comparison with others. [56] But the consensus view is that China just wants to be strong, just as any large developing country wants to be. But Tobin disagreed: Indeed, while some external observers have rushed to point out that the official translation says a global leader not the global leader, it strains credibility that, already seeing itself as the number two power in the world as measured in computations of comprehensive national power, Beijing’s goal could be to work hard for several decades only to remain number two. In specific areas of international competition including economics, science and technology, innovation, and military capabilities, Xi repeatedly talks about “seizing the initiative,” and for and the need for China not to miss another historical opportunity to assume leadership. Indeed, a 2021 People’s Daily editorial under the pseudonym “Manifesto” ( 宣言 ), which Beijing has used several times to express the ambitions of the new era, maintains that “Gaining the upper hand in the competition of comprehensive national power is the key to national rejuvenation.” [57] He then wrote: Yet from Washington’s standpoint it ought to matter that Xi has been relentlessly consistent in framing the PRC as engaged in a systems contest with capitalism, where the CCP’s ability to navigate China to the status of the leading country in the world has implications for the rivalry between socialism and capitalism. [58] In his 19th Party Congress speech, Xi famously declared about the new era: It means that scientific socialism is full of vitality in 21st century China, and that the banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics is now flying high and proud for all to see. It means the path, the theory, the system, and the culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics have kept developing, blazing a new trail for other developing countries to achieve modernization. It offers a new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence: and it offers Chinese wisdom and a Chinese approach to solving the problems facing humanity. [59] Tobin went on to argue that “Xi Jinping, from his first days in office, has continued to underline these arguments for remaining committed to socialism; yet he also returned to the arguments about socialism’s inevitable international triumph that had not been emphasized since the Mao era.” [60] What is troubling is that most U.S. foreign policy experts don’t seem to take Xi seriously, assuming that he is simply mouthing Marxist-Leninist platitudes for the party faithful and doesn’t really mean it. This may be in part because they believe that only countries such as North Korea and the former Soviet Union are/were really Marxist. For them, “socialism with Chinese characteristics” is a slogan the CCP proselytizes to pacify the masses. Most U.S. foreign policy experts don’t seem to take Xi seriously, assuming that he is simply mouthing Marxist-Leninist platitudes for the party faithful and doesn’t really mean it. For them, “socialism with Chinese characteristics” is a slogan the CCP proselytizes to pacify the masses. Yet, as Tobin wrote, “In what would become a famous speech to party cadres at the provincial and ministerial level in early January 2013, underscoring the party’s commitment to the socialist project, Xi frames the contest as one of systems rivalry with capitalism, a contest in which China is behind but will catch-up.” [61] Tobin recounts that Xi stated: Reality has proved again and again that Karl Marx and Frederick Engels’ analysis of the fundamental contradiction in capitalist society is not obsolete, nor is the viewpoint of historical materialism that capitalism is doomed to failure and socialism will prevail. It is an irreversible trend of social development, but the process will be tortuous. It will be a long process that leads to the demise of capitalism and the victory of socialism. We must understand in depth the self-regulating capacity of capitalist society and fully recognize the objective reality that developed Western countries will dominate the economic, scientific, technological and military fields for a long time. We must prepare ourselves for long-term cooperation and rivalry between the two social systems…. The most important thing is that we focus on our development to increase our comprehensive national power, improve our people’s lives, and develop socialism that has more strengths than capitalism, so as to lay a solid foundation for us to seize the initiative, win the competitive edge, and secure our future. Our continued success in adapting Marxism to the Chinese context and the needs of our times has enabled Marxism to take on a fresh face in the eyes of the world, and significantly shifted the worldwide historical evolution of the contest between the two different ideologies and social systems of socialism and capitalism in a way that favors socialism. Tobin went on to note, “Further, Beijing maintained, owing to the PRC’s success, Xi Jinping Thought is: ‘the Marxism of contemporary China and of the 21st century’.” [62] What could be clearer than this? The key point of Tobin’s argument is thus: The thumbnail depiction common among US based China specialists that describes Beijing’s goals as ‘regional dominance and global influence’ undersells and does not comport with either Xi Jinping Thought or the PRC’s actions. On the contrary, Beijing has made it clear under Xi Jinping that it seeks a place of global leadership where the PRC’s proposed solutions to global problems and vision for the global order prevail…. Beijing makes clear that attaining the CCP’s objectives for the Chinese nation requires the construction of the global order along the lines the CCP favors. 103 It is risky to ignore the written words laying out the foreign policy goals of dictators, as Stalin learned to his dismay with Adolph Hitler, who in 1925 laid out in Mein Kampf (My Struggle) his goals of Lebensraum (living space) in the east and destroying Soviet communism. This is not simple economic competition, the frame that U.S. analysts, including economists, embrace. This is conflict between adversaries. As this all relates to national power industries, Tobin wrote, “The PRC further sees these technological frontiers as both an opportunity to seize the leading global position and shape how emerging norms and standards are set.” [63] And this is not simple economic competition, the frame that U.S. analysts, including economists, embrace. This is conflict between adversaries. Tobin also wrote that Xi “talks about the “great struggle” (a CCP euphemism for the systems contest with Western capitalist democracy), and trumpets “We must maintain strategic confidence and strengthen our fighting spirit.” [64] In summary, Tobin wrote: We ought to be able to put to bed suggestions that Beijing’s ambitions for its place in the world are regional (with merely “global influence” as the goal). Rather, the CCP’s vision is that its ideas and solutions become the foundation for the future global order and underpin the future of a deeply interconnected world and the future development of humanity as a whole. If there remained any doubts about the scope of US-PRC strategic rivalry, the 20th Party Congress and its aftermath should have answered them. [65] Charles Parton, a former British diplomat, made similar points. He wrote that, to replace the United States as the world’s leading superpower : [T]he CCP under Xi sees itself engaged in a fierce ‘struggle’ against ‘hostile foreign forces’. For all its accusations that ‘certain countries’ are guilty of a ‘cold war mentality’, the CCP itself is in no doubt that this is a cold war— and an ideological one. As Xi has said, ‘competition between systems is an important aspect of competition for comprehensive national power’, and the dominance of a system gives a country the dominant position in winning the ‘strategic initiative.’ [66] He went on to quote one CCP official: “International struggles are becoming increasingly fierce, and system confrontation has become a prominent feature of the game between major powers. The US suppression [of us] is a major threat but [our struggle with the US] is both a skirmish and a protracted war.” [67] He cited another CCP official with a similar tone of belligerency: “The strategic contest between China and the United States is bound to last for a long period of time, for which we must be fully prepared ideologically and work.” [68] He discussed how the minister of Science and Technology wrote in the People’s Daily , the CCP’s newspaper: [T]he scientific and technological revolution and the contest between major powers are intertwined; the high-tech field has become the forefront and main battlefield of international competition, profoundly influencing the global order and development pattern…the competition between countries is a competition of strength. What is crucial is the competition of scientific and technological innovation capabilities. The underlying contest is about whose system is superior. [69] As such, the CCP sees technology as a core component of national power. Parton went on to discuss how: Influential commentaries and articles in party media at the time of the First Session of the 14th NPC in 2023 made that point clearly: To a certain extent, those who gain access to the internet will gain the world. Seizing the historical opportunity of the information revolution is a major strategic decision related to the construction of a strong country and national rejuvenation. Core technology is an important weapon for the country….Only by holding key core technologies in our own hands can we fundamentally guarantee national economic security, national defence security, and other security. [70] In “A Vision of Success in the U.S.-China Rivalry: The Technological Competition,” Michael J. Mazarr, senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation, wrote: There can be little doubt that Beijing aims to be the unquestioned global leader in a whole series of science- and technology-based industries, from 5G and renewable energy to electric vehicles and biotechnology. (In parallel, it is seeking dominance in less technologically cutting-edge industries such as shipbuilding.) How precisely China defines success in these terms is not clear, although in some cases, such as solar panels, it has achieved something close to a global monopoly position in manufacturing, and in 5G China was apparently seeking to position Huawei similarly as the overwhelmingly dominant global actor. This position of technological overmatch would consequently provide Beijing with tremendous leverage in its broader effort to achieve global leadership. China’s favored end state in the technology competition therefore envisions overall supremacy in many critical fields, all of which can be employed for broader geostrategic effect. [71] We see this focus on influence and struggle in terms of how the CCP conceives of industry. Whereas U.S. thinkers see economic policy as enabling allocation efficiency with no other industry more important than another, CCP officials have a different view. An interview with Lu Feng, a leading professor at Peking University’s School of Government, specializing in industrial policy, technological innovation, and development, gives a sense of this difference. [72] In the interview, cross-posted in the Substacks High Capacity and Sinification , Feng argues that China needs even more industrial development because it is a “strategic asset.” [73] According to interviewers Kyle Chan and colleagues, “Lu Feng argues that China’s industrial base is its ‘greatest source of strength” and a ”strategic asset” akin to U.S. dollar hegemony or Russian oil and gas.” [74] Professor Wang Yu of the Nanjing University Business School said the same in March: The essence of competition among major countries is scientific and technological competition ... The strategic value of strategic emerging industries and future industries lies in their fundamental impact on the future industrial status of various countries, reshape the international division of labor, and enhance national discourse power. [75] Whereas U.S. thinkers see economic policy as enabling allocation efficiency with no other industry more important than another, CCP officials have a different view. The CCP laid out its game plan in China’s Made in China: 2025 plan that calls for China to become a global advanced manufacturing “powerhouse.” [76] The plan stated: Since the beginning of industrial civilization in the middle of the 18 th century, the history of the rise and fall of world powers and the history of the struggle of the Chinese nation has repeatedly proved that without a strong manufacturing industry, there will be no country and no nation. Building an internationally competitive manufacturing industry is the only way China can enhance its comprehensive national strength, ensure national security, and build itself into a world power. It must look to the world, step up strategic deployment, focus on building a manufacturing powerhouse, shore up its roots, and turn challenges into opportunities to seize the commanding heights of a new round of competition in the manufacturing industry. By the 100th anniversary of the founding of New China, the country’s status as a manufacturing industry power must be consolidated, and its comprehensive strength must enter the forefront of the world’s manufacturing powerhouses. The main areas of the manufacturing industry must be innovation-led with obvious competitive advantages, and we will build a world-leading technology system and industrial system. China’s National 13th Five-Year Plan for the Development of Strategic Emerging Industries also gives several indication of the CCP’s intention dominate power industries, including: Industry innovation capabilities must rank first globally, forming first-mover advantages in several major sectors. By 2020, … the self-sufficiency rate for major key materials reaches over 70% to initially realize the strategic transformation of China from materials power to materials superpower. Promote domestic enterprises and Chinese-foreign enterprises in jointly developing international markets, support the “going global” of the supply chain to feed high-quality assets, technology, and management experience from “going global” back to China and form comprehensive competitive advantages. [77] Chan wrote: The US-China rivalry ultimately as a contest between two systems: China’s “industrial socialism” and America’s “financial capitalism.” The US was once an industrial powerhouse like China today with half of global production and an “arsenal of democracy” that changed the course of World War II. But, in a critique with strong political resonance within the US, Lu Feng says the US economy became increasingly “financialized,” dominated by the short-term interests of Wall Street investors, causing America’s industrial base to atrophy. In contrast, China’s socialist system ensured that financial resources would be directed toward supporting the “real economy” and steer China away from the standard path of deindustrialization. [78] China is working on a Made in China: 2035 plan that aims to surpass the United States in all advanced production industries. Lu Yongxiang, former vice-chairman of the National People’s Congress, in a commentary published in 2024 in the “Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering” stated, “It is estimated that by 2035, ‘Made in China’ will surpass the United States and become the global leader.” [79] He went on to note, “‘Irreversible US production declines amid an expanding Chinese economy will thrust world into a new era.” Note “U.S. declines” and “new era.” The CCP knows that its effort to lead the world cannot come without absolute U.S. decline in advanced industries. And the new era refers to an era in which China is dominant. And as Xi Jinping has stated, “Technological innovation has become the main battleground of the global playing field, and competition for tech dominance w ill grow unprecedentedly fierce.” [80] Note the terms “battlefield” and “dominance.” Likewise, as a CCP report titled “General Laws of the Rise of Great Powers” states, “Becoming a major manufacturing power provides crucial security for the goal of realizing the Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation.” [81] In an article in state-run publication, the author wrote: ‘Advancing Chinese-style Modernization Requires Handling Several Major Relationships Well,’ General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out the need to ‘strengthen national strategic scientific and technological capabilities, guided by national strategic needs, focus on original and leading scientific and technological research, and resolutely win the battle to overcome key core technologies. [82] Likewise, in the CCP-controlled publication Peoples Forum , Wei Ziping, a teacher at the School of Public Administration and Law, Anhui University of Technology, wrote in 2023 that China needs to “accelerate progress toward our goal of leading the world in key core technologies, build China into a global power in science and technology, expand the space for Chinese-style modernization through institutionalized, high-level openness and cooperation, and realize the Chinese Dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.” [83] One leading Chinese scholar spoke at a major conference, “The competition for the Fourth Industrial Revolution will be held between China and the US. But America also suffers from the diseases of neoliberal politics. Its prospects are not bright. For China this once-in-a-century race is an opportunity.” [84] Former Deputy National Security Advisor Matt Pottinger describes a meeting during the first Trump administration with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing: Addressing Trump from across the table, Premier Li painted a menacing picture of the not-so-distant future. China, he said, would completely dominate this century’s most important technologies, including artificial intelligence. The world would become more dependent on China than ever before. The United States, Li said, was destined to export little more to China than soybeans and corn. To add insult to injury, Li said Beijing would purchase substitutes for U.S. agriculture if the Communist regime was unhappy with Washington for one reason or another. [85] Maybe this was bluster, or maybe he was turning over this cards to show the CCP’s hand. Either way, there is increasing evidence that China is preparing for a major external crisis; what Xi calls “extreme-case” situations, or “jiduan qingkuang.” Whether that is war, we do not know. [86] What Rand Scholar Jimmy Goodrich calls China’s “fortress economy” involves both defense and offense. [87] None of this is the language of nation seeking to just move up the development ladder; it is language of power and domination. [88] The CCP knows that its effort to lead the world cannot come without absolute U.S. decline in advanced industries. And the new era refers to an era in which China is dominant. CCP leaders are savvy enough to not explicitly show their hand, at least in venues that Westerners are likely to come across. After many nations expressed alarm, CCP officials understood that they were in error when they were so explicit about their goals for industrial power in Made in China: 2025. Shortly thereafter, Chinese leaders quietly dropped most if not all references to it, even as they doubled down on its implementation. [89] But that does not mean that it is still not their strategy. The title of Rush Doshi’s book, The Long Game: China’s Grand Strategy to Displace American Order , says it all. This is not just about China rising, but also about China displacing the United States and other Western leaders, and the techno-economic battlefield is where much of the conflict will be fought. He writes that China’s strategy is to displace the United States, including in the techno-economic sphere, and it uses predatory practices to accomplish that. [90] U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a report when he was the chair of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, concluding that China was doing more than “breaking the rules” to dominate high-value industrial sectors. [91] This helps explain why, despite a highly polarized political climate, Congress managed to pass the CHIPS and Science Act, which invests billions of dollars to support new semiconductor factories in the United States. Nothing promotes unity like a shared and frightening enemy. In a report for the Hoover Institution—“Economic Statecraft: The Need For An Integrated Approach”—H.R. McMaster and Andrew Grotto discussed the need for the USG to “exercise broad discretion to intervene in the economy to address a threat emanating from overseas (e.g. China).” [92] It rightly argues: US administrations consistently undervalue the degree to which strategic application of economic power is essential for advancing US vital interests…The United States must act to counter Chinese economic aggression—nonmarket actions intended to harm American companies, impair US manufacturing, or coerce the United States and its allies. [93] In Getting China Wrong, Princeton University scholar Aaron Friedberg argued that: Growth and development have not caused China’s rulers to relax their grip on political power, abandon their mercantilist economic policies, or accept the rules and norms of the existing international system. To the contrary: China today is more repressive at home, more aggressive abroad, and more obviously intent on establishing itself as the world’s preponderant power than at any time since the death of Chairman Mao. Likewise, as Fredberg noted, “The key to understanding Xi’s economic policies is to recognize that they are principally about power, not prosperity. He will almost certainly forge ahead toward concentrating the world’s industrial power within China.” [94] He went to write: Rather than letting the free play of market forces and the principle of comparative advantage determine the international distribution of industrial capacity, it seeks deliberately to build “national champions,” helping them to acquire and “indigenize” critical technologies and supporting their efforts to dominate domestic and global markets for cutting-edge products. [95] Finally, an anonymous author of an Atlantic Council report entitled “The Longer Telegram” warned that implementing an effective China strategy would “require a firm understanding of Xi’s strategic objectives, which include the following: leapfrog the United States as a technological power and thereby displace it as the world’s dominant economic power.” [96] China follows a predictable playbook for trying to dominate advanced industries. Even with what should be compelling evidence of the CCP’s intent, there will be those who say that these words are for internal consumption and don’t reflect the CCP’s external goals. Or that these translations make subtle but important mistakes that distort meaning. To those, I would argue, look at what the CCP has been doing. China follows a predictable playbook for trying to dominate advanced industries. The first step is to attract foreign investment. In the early 1980s, when Deng Xiaoping opened up the Chinese economy to foreign investment, his main economic development strategy sought principally to induce foreign multinationals to shift relatively low- and moderate-value production to China. [97] China is still trying to do that today with emerging industries, seeking, for example, to attract global biopharmaceutical companies to build facilities in China. China’s second step is to attempt to learn from foreign companies, in part by having them train Chinese executives, scientists, and engineers, and also by forced technology transfer, including through joint ventures. In 2015, 6,000 new international joint ventures, amounting to $27.8 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, were established in China. [98] And the sophistication and value of the technology the Chinese government has demanded is high. As the United States Trade Representative’s (USTR’s) Office pointed out in its 2018 Special 301 report on China, pressures on U.S. companies to form joint ventures and transfer technology “is particularly intense.” [99] Figure 1: 1958 CCP poster exhorting Chinese workers and companies to “surpass Britain in 15 years” in industrial production [100] The third step is to support Chinese companies in their efforts to copy and incorporate foreign technology while building up domestic capabilities. One important marker for the transition from stage two to stage three was the publication in 2006 of the “National Medium- and Long-term Program for Science and Technology Development (2006–2020),” which called on China to master 402 core technologies—everything from intelligent automobiles to integrated circuits and high-performance computers. China moved to a “China Inc.” development model of indigenous innovation, which focused on helping Chinese firms, especially those in advanced, innovation-based industries, often at the expense of foreign firms. The fourth step is to enable Chinese firms to become independent innovators. China is attempting to do this through an array of plans and policies: “13th Five-Year Plan for Science and Technology,” “13th Five-Year Plan for National Informatization,” “The National Cybersecurity Strategy,” and “Made in China 2025 Strategy,” and most recently Xi Jinping’s call at the 20th Party Congress for “invigorating China through science and education ... for the strategy of innovation-driven development .” [101] A key part of this step is to squeeze out the foreign companies that they had initially invited in. The Chinese market essentially becomes dominated by Chinese-owned firms. We have seen this an array of industries, including chemicals, telecom equipment, heavy construction equipment, high-speed rail, and renewable energy. The CCP then carves out and preserves the Chinese market for Chinese firms. For example, the Chinese government included 57 domestic auto battery makers in the catalog, meaning that foreign giants such as Samsung, LG, and Panasonic were excluded. [102] This demonstrates how China protects its domestic champions while they build capacity for international expansion. The final step is to then support these companies “going out” and taking market share in other parts of the world. Unfortunately, for gaining political support for a robust U.S. strategy to respond to China, the United States is among the last places Chinese firms will seek to enter. Rather, they are going after market share in places such as Latin America, Southeast Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe, the “soft underbelly” of global markets. As their firms gain market share, Western—including U.S.—firms, lose market share, and tipping points can happen quite quickly. China backs this all up by massive subsidies to its industries. Firms often have to compete in “unfair” markets, if only because many factors affect the value of currency. Hence, firms can find themselves with an uncompetitive cost structure in global markets even though they are doing everything right. But leaving this aside, firm competition plays out through several key factors, with price and quality being the most important. If one firm is provided subsidies (including a devalued currency), it has—all else equal—a competitive advantage over its foreign competitors that receive limited subsidies. The firm can use that advantage to cut prices and gain market share. It can boost its scale and learning economies. Or it can invest those subsidies in R&D and other areas to boost quality and innovation, again taking market share from its competitors. China’s subsidies are on steroids because of the intense competition for industry between its cities and provinces, which shell out massive funds to support local champions. And it ignores the supposed WTO disciplines on subsidies. While a number of nations have relied on many forms of subsidies (low corporate taxes, tax incentives, grants, subsidized costs of inputs such as energy, and a suppressed value of their currency), by and large, the scale of the subsidies is usually limited, often by domestic political pressures from voters demanding lower taxes or higher spending to directly benefit them. At the same time, many Western nations implement various subsidy-limitation measures because they want competition to be on a level playing field. But China is exempt from all of those limitations. China’s subsidies are on steroids, in part because of the intense competition for industry between its cities and provinces, which shell out massive funds to support local champions. And China flouts the flaccid WTO disciplines on subsidies. The magnitude and extent of Chinese subsidies have been widely documented. Though dated, Haley and Haley’s book Chinese Industrial Subsidies documents just how sizeable these were and the role they played in enabling China to gain global market share in the 2000s. More recently, Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) found, “Even using a conservative methodology, China’s industrial policy spending is enormous, totaling at least 1.73 percent of GDP in 2019. This is equivalent to more than $248 billion at nominal exchange rates and $407 billion at purchasing power parity exchange rates.” [103] A new study from a German institute estimates, “Overall, industrial subsidies in China are several times higher than those in large EU and OECD countries. The size of the estimated difference ranges from a ratio of at least three to four in conservative estimates to a ratio of as high as nine in more encompassing studies.” [104] In 2022, 99 percent of listed firms in China received direct government subsidies. For example, the German study finds that Chinese EV maker BYD has received over $3.7 billion in subsidies. Overall, in 2019, Chinese industrial subsidies were 4.5 times greater than the United States as a share of GDP, and that is accounting for the U.S. subsidies related to national defense and government support for scientific research. [105] Hand in hand with subsidies are market access restrictions. The first directly helps a domestic company gain market share; the second helps indirectly by reducing the market share of a foreign competitor and increasing that domestic firm’s share. For example, when the Chinese government tells its state-owned telecom providers to stop using American computer chips in their systems, it weakens companies such as Intel and AMD while strengthening Chinese companies such as SMIC. China’s massive size means that it an and is seeking competitive advantage in every technology, current and emerging. In comparison, Japan in the 1980s and 1990s sought and gained advantage in significantly fewer sectors (e.g., consumer electronics, steel, autos, and chemicals). This size also means that because China manages its market and limits foreign sales once its firms get to a certain scale, Chinese firms are blessed with massive, largely secure market revenues, and this includes massive government subsidies. In addition, the scope of state power to punish foreign firms and favor domestic ones is unprecedented. By cutting off foreign firms (or reducing their China revenue) while bestowing lavish benefits on its own firms, Chinese firms are able to sell below cost for many years, if not decades, all with the goal of taking market share away from global leaders. Japanese firms also did that, but to a much more limited extent. China’s massive size means that it can and is seeking competitive advantage in every technology, current and emerging. In comparison, Japan in the 1980s and 1990s sought and gained advantage in significantly fewer sectors. One reason why international trade theory holds that low-wage countries won’t dominate global trade because of their low costs is that they also have low productivity. Thus, when pundits warn that the United States can’t compete with low-wage nations because of our higher labor costs, they are ignoring the fact that what matters is productivity-adjusted labor costs. And it is a normal pattern of development that labor costs in virtually all countries tend to track labor productivity quite closely. According to Claude AI, there is a 0.88 correlation between labor costs and national labor productivity, just as we would expect. The average ratio of wages to productivity for 42 countries is 0.51, and in the United States it is 0.53, whereas in China it is just 0.24. In other words, if Chinese wages were half of Chinese productivity levels, as is the case in virtually all other nations, then wages in China would be twice as high, significantly reducing its competitive advantage in global markets. One recent study examined five manufacturing industries, including electric vehicles, shipbuilding, and steel and argued that for a variety of reasons the Chinese government undercounts industry productivity. [106] The author found that physical output per worker averaged 2.4 times higher than U.S. output per worker, and value-added per worker was 20 percent higher, on average. Assuming that the value-added measure is a more accurate, apples-to-apples comparison, this means that China’s cost-to-productivity ratio is between 6 and 12 times greater than the U.S. ratio, given that Chinese workers earn around 20 percent of U.S. workers’ wages in dollar terms. This suggests that China is breaking the historical model for developing nations, where wages track productivity. The PRC is making sure that the benefits of productivity don’t go to Chinese workers but rather to foreign consumers who can buy cheaper products, with the goal of driving foreign producers out of business. This is consistent with a longstanding CCP pattern of giving short shrift to nonmanufacturing productivity growth and instead maintaining a laser-like focus on raising productivity in manufacturing. While up-to-date quantitative data is not available, it is clear that China is doubling down on this approach in manufacturing. ITIF has calculated that, in 2021, China had 12 times more robots in use per manufacturing worker as did the United States when controlling for wage levels (higher-wage nations should have more robots than should low-wage nations). [107] In 2022, China had 59 percent more robots per manufacturing worker than did the United States. [108] And it installed more robots than the rest of the world combined did. [109] It is encouraging highly automated factories, including so-called “dark factories” with very few workers. This suppression of manufacturing labor costs coupled with acceleration of manufacturing productivity through automation appears to be gaining in focus in China, and is a powerful weapon for gaining global market share. The PRC is making sure that the benefits of productivity don’t go to Chinese workers but rather to foreign consumers who can buy cheaper products, with the goal of driving foreign producers out of business. As noted, the CCP knows that if it clearly articulates its techno-economic war strategy that it will mobilize both defensive and offensive reaction from the West. And so, of course, it does not. But one way we can get a sense of it is by examining China’s global business expansion strategy. If China were only focused on gaining self-reliance from the United States it would be much less focused on gaining global market share. China’s “Going Out” ( 走出去 ) policy is a comprehensive government strategy launched in the early 2000s to encourage Chinese companies to expand internationally. The government encouraged companies to “go further outwards” (Jinyibu zouchuqu) in its 11th Five-Year Plan (2006–2010). Government policies encouraged Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and private enterprises to pursue investments in markets around the world, resulting in the internationalization of SOEs. The government specifically uses SOEs as vehicles for international expansion, providing them with preferential treatment and resources. China’s sovereign funds have also supported efforts to Go Out, including by helping Chinese enterprises finance mergers and acquisitions abroad. In 2015, for example, China Investment Corporation turned one of its divisions into the wholly owned subsidiary CIC Capital. This provided Chinese companies with massive capital backing for overseas acquisitions. And of course, its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) represents the most ambitious manifestation of the Going Out strategy. In the first 10 years of the initiative (2013–2023), China inked roughly $1 trillion worth of investment and construction deals with BRI countries [110] Between 2000 and 2022, Chinese financiers committed to lending or donating $1.34 trillion to low- and medium-income countries—nearly $800 billion of this was in the first decade of the BRI from 2013 to 2022. [111] The Chinese state is the underwriter for the initiative, via its four state-owned banks lending to SOEs. [112] At the same time, PRC banks provide vastly more support for foreign investment than do USG institutions. [113] Box 2: Chinese Competition and American Deindustrialization: A Financial Framework [114] Different financial systems help determine the outcomes of the techno-economic war. China’s system is designed to aggressively destroys Western company value. The U.S. system is designed to maximize short-term wealth creation and is agnostic toward national industrial power competition. The U.S. Economic Model Publicly traded corporations in capital-intensive sectors (e.g., industrials) optimize three key variables. The first is economic value added (EVA). EVA equals return on invested capital (ROIC) minus the weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (ROIC - WACC) times the amount of invested capital (IC). The weighted average cost of capital for U.S. firms is around 8–10 percent. ROIC equals net operating profit after tax NOPAT divided by invested capital. Profit margins are calculated in various ways. Gross margin is sales minus the cost of goods and production labor. From an industrial standpoint, the most relevant profit margin is the gross margin. The others are influenced by a firm’s overhead expenses and its tax, investment, and capital strategy. The U.S. model is more financialized and focus on higher, short-term returns than other capitalist economies. But China is in a completely different model. The Chinese Economic Model Chinese firms systematically generate ROIC well below American WACC thresholds. The Chinese semiconductor firm SMIC, for example, posts approximately 4.5 percent ROIC versus around 12 to 16 percent global semiconductor industry WACC, creating negative EVA by American standards. Chinese EVA = (4.5% - 12%) × IC = -7.5% × IC. In other words, Chinese firms can survive on ROIC that is less than the cost of capital in the United States. This economic value destruction manifests as the “China price”—aggressive pricing that destroys gross margins industry-wide. Chinese firms partially compensate through higher capital turns (sales/IC), enabled by rapid market expansion and debt-financed growth. Chinese firms can do this because of overall financial repression in China. The PRC prevents savers from getting normal returns, and its capital controls on foreign investment preclude outside options. Both lower the cost of capital. [115] At the same time Chinese companies are pressured by the PRC to accept low returns and provided with low-cost capital from state-owned banks in order to gain market share. [116] American Industrial Response Faced with Chinese “scorched earth” competition, U.S. firms can generally only pursue two strategies that make up essentially the mirror image of Chinese value destruction: Strategy 1: Asset-Light Retrenchment Given this unbeatable competition, one strategy is for U.S. firms to reduce their IC base through outsourcing of production assets to someone else’s balance sheet. At the same time, they focus on capital-light activities with higher margins, such as design, sales and market, and software. And they tend to limit expensive investments in capital equipment. Strategy 2: Cost Reduction for Margin Protection A second strategy is offshore supply chains and production of lower-cost inputs to preserve gross margins. At the same time, they are forced to press for lower prices from domestic suppliers and workers. Capital Allocation Logic: Both of these strategies are additionally supported by a capital strategy that increases earnings per share. In particular, the companies use freed-up cash for share buybacks. Since earnings per share equals Net Income divided by the number of outstanding shares, so EPS can go up with stock buy backs. With Chinese competitors destroying economic value while gaining market share, new productive investments cannot be justified. The rational response for these companies is returning cash to investors through share buybacks, inflating EPS even as the industrial base shrinks. Deindustrialization Outcome Both strategies hollow out domestic industrial capacity: Strategy 1 directly reduces the manufacturing base, while Strategy 2 degrades supplier ecosystems and workforce capabilities. The result is a self-reinforcing cycle wherein American firms lose the ability to scale innovation and compete in advanced manufacturing, validating Andy Grove’s 2010 warning about the strategic risks of abandoning production competencies. While some populists on the Right and the Left decry U.S. industrial corporations for taking these steps, accusing them of being profit hungry, this is too narrow a focus. The normal rate of capital returns in normal market economies is above 8 to 12 percent, given the cost of capital. No company can survive earning less than the cost of its capital. As such, if these companies tried to do that to meeting the China price, rational shareholders, including labor union pension funds, would invest in other sectors and companies that do not face this constraint, such as insurance and banking, logistics, and entertainment. Rather than engage in emotionally satisfying and politically rewarding hectoring of selfish U.S. capitalists, a better strategy is to limit Chinese scorched earth competition while providing targeted incentives for national power industries to stay in the fight and keep investing. Perhaps the fundamental flaw in the thinking of most in the U.S. foreign policy establishment, including the mass of pundits, journalists, think tank scholars, and academics is their dismissal of the importance of national power industries and lack of understanding of how these industries actually work. Most in the foreign policy establishment are educated in everything but how national power industries work. A random case in point: Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Affairs Masters’ Program curriculum. Students focus on international relations, regional studies, and language studies. But they also must take a set of courses on international economics. This sounds promising, until looking at the courses: “[T]he Economics I track covers topics in Microeconomics and International Trade Theory, and the Economics II track covers topics in Macroeconomics and International Finance. The Essentials courses are more conceptual in nature and require only basic math skills.” [117] As noted, these have almost nothing to do with business strategy, technology development, or industrial policy. Harvard’s course list for its international relations master’s program includes courses such as “Globalization and the Nation State” and “The Evolution of Deterrence Theory.” Out of around 50 courses, there is just 1 that might bear on the U.S.-China tech war and that is “ The Geopolitics of Technology,” but like most of the limited focus in U.S. graduate school International relations, they are on the internet, exploring things like cybersecurity, ethical issues in AI, and cybersecurity.” [118] Tuft’s Flecther School of Global Affairs seems more promising, offering an entire program on “Technology and International Affairs” but it too is focused on the Internet and cyber. [119] It’s International Economic Relations track seems promising, but it is neoclassical international economics, not power economics. Its International Security track is promising, but this is related to military issues, and of course, cyber conflict. Perhaps the fundamental flaw in the thinking of most in the U.S. foreign policy establishment is their dismissal of the importance of national power industries and lack of understanding of how they work. To be sure, these kinds of courses are quite important for being able to effectively study and participate in U.S. international relations, but they have little or nothing to do to prepare the student for understanding the importance of power trade, much less being able to understand what to do. As one distinguished U.S. foreign policy official said to me, “I wish we had learned technology in the foreign policy establishment, given how central it is now to the field.” Well, they didn’t and therefore they give technology and national power industries short shrift. And we see that in most foreign policy books on China, including the excellent new book by China foreign policy expert George Shambaugh, Breaking the Engagement , where technology is hardly mentioned. They stick with what they know best: diplomacy, foreign policy, great power, competition, human rights, etc. The U.S. foreign policy experts completely ignored the reality, possibility, and success of the Chinese techno-economic war in part because they denied the reality that certain industries provided power. They wanted a relationship that, as Shambaugh wrote, “would become more stable, productive and manageable. The more threads tying down the relationship like Gulliver, the more impediments there would be to systemic disruption.” [120] But what disruption? For them, disruption meant not talking. They ignored the erosion eating into U.S. national power industry strengths. Pushing back against that would hurt the most important thing: dialogue. If the lion’s share of the U.S. foreign policy establishment ignore industry, perhaps with exception of defense contractors and large Internet platforms, the MAGA right loves all industry and wants to reindustrialize America, from baseball mitts to biotechnology. What America needs is a “third way” for trade grounded in strategic industry trade policy based on the realization that some industries matter far more than others. The conventional view is that the only industries that matter to national power are defense industries. But that is now vastly too limiting. As Corelli Barnett, wrote, “For munitions production for modern war is not primarily a question of specialized armament industries, as some suppose, but of all those varied industrial and scientific resources that in peacetime make for a successful and expanding export trade.” [121] As such, ITIF has developed a classification of U.S. industries for their relevance to national power. This can be viewed as a continuum between defense industries on one side, nonstrategic industries on the other, and strategic industries and strategic enabling industries in the middle. See figure 2. Figure 2: Industrial power scale At one end of the continuum are defense industries. Clearly industries such as ammunition, guided missiles, military aircraft and ships, tanks, drones, defense satellites, and others are strategic. Not having world class innovation and production capabilities in these industries means a weakened military capability. Policymakers across the aisle generally (with the exception of the isolationist Right and the pacifist Left) agree that these industries are strategic and that market forces alone will not produce the needed results. At the other end of the spectrum are industries in which the United States has no real strategic interests. These include furniture, coffee and tea manufacturing, bicycles, carpet and rug mills, window and door production, plastic bottle manufacturing, wind turbine production, lawn and garden equipment, sporting goods, jewelry, caskets, toys, toiletries, running shoes, etc. If worst came to worst and our adversaries (e.g., China) gained dominance in any of these industries and decided to cut America off, we’d survive—in part, because none of these are critical to the running of the U.S. economy, as many are final goods that might inconvenience consumers but wouldn’t cripple any industries, and also because, in most cases, domestic production could be started or expanded relatively easily because none of these products are all that technological complex from either a product or process concern and the barriers to entry are relatively low. Next to defense industries dual-use industries are critical to American strength. Losing aerospace, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, semiconductors, displays, advanced software, fiber optic cable, telecom equipment, machine tools, motors, measuring devices, and other dual-use sectors would give our adversaries incredible leverage over America. Just the threat to cut these off (assuming that they have also deindustrialized our allies in these sectors) would immediately bring U.S. policymakers to the bargaining table. National power industries tend to also need global scale in order to complete. Moreover, many are intermediate goods such as semiconductors and chemicals, where a cutoff would cripple many other industries. Finally, these industries are hard to stand up once they’re lost because of the complexity of the production process, product knowledge, and the importance of the industrial commons that support them. In other words, barriers to entry are high and, if lost, would be very difficult and expensive to reconstitute. What America needs is a “third way” for trade grounded on strategic industry trade policy based on realization that some industries matter far more than others. Finally, there are enabling industries. These are industries wherein, if the United States were cut off, the immediate effects on military readiness would be small. And the U.S. economy could survive for at least a while without production. America could survive for many years without an auto sector, as we would all just drive cars longer. But because of the nature of these industries—including technology development, process innovation, skills, and supporting institutions—their loss would harm both dual-use and defense industries. That is because enabling industries contribute to the industrial commons that support dual-use defense industries. A severely weakened motor vehicle sector would weaken the tank and military vehicle ecosystem. Similarly, a weakened commercial shipbuilding sector has weakened military shipbuilding. A weakened consumer electronics sector weakens military electronics. We can see this in China, whereby the fact that it employs 213 million manufacturing workers, including engineers and technicians, gives it an enormous sophisticated and dynamic production system with synergies and spillovers between enabling industries, national power industries, and defense industries. Indeed, China does not and cannot draw firm lines between civil and military industries and technologies, and instead tries to fuse them. In a companion report to this one, ITIF has put the 970 industries classified by the North American Industry Classification codes into the four categories. [122] Power industries account for 22.3 percent of the industries. (See figure 3 below and table 2 in the third appendix.) Most industries are not power industries, in large part because most are nontraded sectors such as law firms and barber shops. Of the 22.3 percent that are power industries, just 0.5 percent are defense industries, and 13.4 percent are dual use. The remaining 8.4 percent are enabling industries. In terms of employment, in 2022, just 9.5 percent of workers were employed in power industries. Of this, 6.4 percent worked in dual-use industries and 2.9 percent in enabling industries, and just 0.2 percent were employed in defense industries. Figure 3: Breakdown of six-digit NAICS industries according to ITIF’s national power industry typology As such, trade policy should be focused first and foremost on defense, strategic, and enabling sectors and largely ignore nonstrategic. The problem is that Trumpian economic nationalism, at least as represented by some of his key officials, sees all four as equally worth of protection. Why else would Trump fight Canada so hard for dairy and wood products trade, clearly nonpower sectors. Likewise, why else would the administration push so hard for natural gas and farm product exports? Boosting exports of the former will reduce American fossil fuel resources, while boosting exports of the latter will do little to increase American food security. At the same time, policymakers lack two key insights needed to respond in effective ways. The first is that some industries are strategic. Yet, both political parties have embraced a “potato chips, computer chips, what’s the difference?” mentality. The head of one of the leading international economic policy think tanks in Washington said when asked how much manufacturing the United States could lose and still be okay, “All of it.” Today, the Trump tariffs are anything but strategic, with the view that the chicken industry is as important as the chip industry. The intent of this project is to change that so that there is a broader consensus around Washington on the criticality of strategic industries for the Republic’s future. 1. Global trade is particularly important in most national power trade industries, particularly dual use. These industries are different in core ways from other industries. Given their high fixed costs relative to marginal costs and the fact that they must reinvest profits to produce the required next round of innovation, firms in these industries require access to global markets. 2. In addition, firms in these industries are much more susceptible to dying. If CCP competitors can gain enough global market share, they can enter into a virtuous cycle of more revenue, more profits, and more investment in the next round of innovation and so on. Conversely, firms that lose market share risk falling into a death spiral, where they invest less in R&D and new product development and process innovation, and therefore their next rounds of products/services fall behind their competitors, leading to another round of reversal. 3. Dual-use and defense industries also differ in that they are the engines of national power. To be sure, certain traditional industries, such as steel, are important to national security. However, many traditional industries are largely commodities produced in many countries and are largely available as inputs. Advanced industries are different. Production is concentrated in relatively few countries. Advanced innovation/production ecosystems contribute to and support defense industries. And these industries enable national power to be projected and to defend against adversaries attempting to project their power. Losing aerospace, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, semiconductors, displays, advanced software, fiber optic cable, telecom equipment, machine tools, motors, measuring devices, and other dual-use sectors would give America’s adversaries incredible leverage. We have seen the importance of national power industries in history. Case in point, the relative weakness of Great Britain against Germany in both WWI and WWII. The advancement of Germany’s broad industrial base, and the atrophy of Britain’s, resulted in the latter’s relative military weakness, with only the entry of the United States in both wars enabling Britain to escape without military defeat. In his classic book The Collapse of British Power , Corelli Barnett wrote that: it was not the small size and partial decrepitude of Britain’s specialized armaments in industry that were mainly responsible for throttling back British armament. For specialized armament firms constitute only a small part of the production of modern war equipment, which is a matter of general industrial resources and technology, especially in all kinds of advanced engineering. It was such general and varied resources that Germany had been able to swiftly convert to producing munitions after 1933 but it was such a resources that Great Britain terribly lacked just as in 1914-15 as the Defence Policy and Requirements Committee had warned in submitting its recommendations for a large scale rearmament in February 1936: “The most serious factor in the completion of the proposed program is the limited output of our existing industrial resources. The key to successful completion of the service programs lie in the solution of the industrial problem. [123] Largely because of the dominant “liberal” “Adam Smithian” view of the role of government in industrial development, Britain never learned this lesson. After WWII, with the profligacy of the Beveridge-Attlee welfare state, the British once again “failed to retool the economy before European and Japanese competitors recovered from wartime devastation.” [124] For the British, the sad and stark reality is that it was too late for them to do anything meaningful with regard to power industries, even if the British political economy could enable needed action, which it could not. America is not Britain today, but it is Britian in the early 1960s: still a chance to retool but with time slipping by quickly and few political economy resources to take the painful and needed steps. Just as past wars provided the impetus for transformations in American techno-economic and trade regimes, it will be easier for American leaders and pundits to see that we are in a war after war starts. But if China bides its time for a least another decade or two, by then it will be too late, because the odds are Chinese firms will have begun to dominate most power industries. And importantly, once lost, it is virtually impossible to regain competitive position in most national power industries, especially ones that require global economies of scale. America is not Britain today, but it is Britian in the early 1960s: still a chance to retool but with time slipping by quickly and few political economy resources to take the painful and needed steps. The dominant view among most in Washington thinking about this challenge is to either 1) be largely unaware of barriers to entry, which would make it difficult if not virtually impossible in some industries for the United States to regain power industry capabilities once lost or 2) to believe that it doesn’t matter because the United States will just continue to innovate. The prevailing view about competitiveness in Washington is that innovation rains down from above for free, as MIT economist Robert Solow conceived of it, like manna from heaven. [125] It just is there for the taking. A slightly more sophisticated view is that it just requires a few favorable conditions such as risk-taking entrepreneurs, strong research universities, and venture capital. The fact that the United States is strong in innovation provides an ample intellectual crutch that prevents taking serious national power industry competition and loss. And so the thinking goes that, while it would be nice not to lose these old industries (old is usually defined as anything that was started 15 to 20 years ago), at the end of the day, America will prevail because we can play our innovation card. The Obama administration 2010 National Innovation Strategy summed up the prevailing view from both the Left and the Right: “Innovation—the process by which individuals and organizations generate new ideas and put them into practice—is the foundation of American economic growth and national competitiveness.” [126] And the key to that innovation is “Competitive markets provide strong incentives for private businesses to improve their products and operations and for capital and labor resources to be reinvested in our best ideas.” [127] If that is the case, we should welcome Chinese power industry predation because it ramps up the competitive pressures, providing even stronger pressures for U.S. companies to innovate. A recent article in Issues in Science and Technology , a magazine of the National Academies of Science, agrees: “We believe that American competitiveness … can be maximized by fostering breakthrough innovations.” [128] This is a bit like saying “small business drives growth”: both are aphorisms. Who can disagree with either? One appeal in the United States of an innovation strategy—or for some, an innovation culture—is that it avoids the dreaded “industrial policy” and picking winners. The market and plucky entrepreneurs in their garages will create the winners. The role of the government is to stay out of the way, provide them with foreign STEM workers, and keep capital gains taxes low. In an article by Tanner Greer, wherein he developed a typology of strategies on competing with China, he identified dynamists who focus on technology (rather than more broadly on industry) and who are skeptical or critical of state capacity: Dynamists are instead focused squarely on deregulating the American economy and reforming the American state. In their eyes, Chinese drone dominance is less a product of Chinese industrial policy than a result of the Federal Aviation Administration’s “war on technology;” America’s failure to match the stunning new infrastructure of China is best blamed on the National Environmental Policy Act regime; and cutting-edge developments in AI, crypto, and software engineering would have already transformed the American economy if not for the “regulatory capture, special interests, and perverse structural incentives” that have sheltered entrenched incumbents from real competition. [129] Dynamists live in a narrow world, believing that Silicon Valley is the “be all and end all” of technological innovation and that the government has played only a minor role in the Valley’s emergence as the world’s top technology hub. And for them solving the problem is pretty easy: just get rid of government barriers, such as on immigration, building restrictions, and narrow-minded government management of science. Then our heroic entrepreneurs can ride to the rescue and save us. Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google, wrote that the United States should spend less time focusing on limiting China. Instead, he wrote: “If the United States really wants to reindustrialize, it needs to double down on what it does best, including supporting scientific research, enacting immigration policies that welcome the best talent from abroad, and reducing regulatory hurdles.” [130] However, there are three key limitations to relying on innovation strategy, from more free market dynamists or more interventionist tech policy advocates, in ensuring U.S. national power industry strength. The first is, by definition, that an innovation strategy is agnostic with respect to power industries. We already see that where there is a growing concern that U.S. venture capital avoids so-called “deep tech,” also called “hard tech.” These are technologies that tend to be beyond software and the Internet, and require much more capital and engineering capabilities. Most power industries are hard tech. But they require more capital and have higher risks, so the market invests less than needed in them. Perhaps like rolling the dice, risk-taking entrepreneurs and profit-maximizing venture firms might invest in all the areas of power industries the nation needs, but the odds are a bit like rolling snake eyes six times in a row. Second, innovation is only the first step. Power comes from being able to produce and sell the innovation around the world. History is full of examples wherein the United State led on innovation only to have production go overseas, often to foreign companies. These include VHS technology, TVs, LCD displays, solar panels, robotic vacuum cleaners, EV batteries, CNC machine tools, robotics, digital cameras, high-speed rail, digital telecom equipment, LED lighting, carbon fiber, 3D-printing materials, MRI machines, and more. [131] To be sure, innovation is important; without it, American power industries would ultimately lose market share. But more innovation without domestic production does not boost national power. If anything, it gives power to China when Chinese companies enter production based on U.S. discoveries, which they all too often steal or otherwise purloin. Third, to the extent innovationists focus only on emerging tech, this misses the boat. Despite all the hype, America can’t fight and win wars with only superior AI. Moreover, as noted, power comes also from independence from China in key industries and products. Many of these are not cutting-edge technologies. History is full of examples wherein the United State led on innovation only to have production go overseas, often to foreign companies. Fourth, the idea that deregulation and a more supportive culture are enough to restore U.S. techno-economic power is an ideological fantasy. As discussed ahead, not losing the war will require significant state action, just as not losing U.S. semiconductor capability required public investment (tax and direct), not just an R&D program. Fifth, success relies in part on already having strong existing industries with an innovation ecosystem, which, if we lose, makes innovation harder. Innovation is not just something that happens. Put someone in the middle of nowhere and it’s unlikely you will get much innovation. Innovation is enabled by a rich ecosystem that includes existing companies. Indeed, many innovators used to work at large established companies and gained knowledge and connections that enabled them to innovate. The list is endless: Reid Hoffman left PayPal to start LinkedIn, Marc Benioff left Oracle to start Salesforce, Scott McNealy left IBM to cofound Sun Microsystems, Gordon Moore and Jerry Sanders left Fairchild Semiconductor to found Intel and AMD, respectively, and Jensen Huang left AMD/LSI Logic to cofound NVIDIA. It’s not just that existing companies are incubators for entrepreneurial founders; they also support what Shih and Pisano call the “industrial commons.” The industrial commons refers to the collective ecosystem of shared resources, infrastructure, specialized skills, and knowledge that enable a region’s manufacturing competitiveness and resilience. It encompasses the interconnected network of suppliers, researchers, skilled workers, and development capabilities that, when nurtured together, foster innovation and economic growth within a particular geographic area. As one article asserts, “A country does not rise to the level of its innovation. It falls to the level of its industrial commons.” [132] This is why former Intel CEO Andy Grove stated, perhaps in response to the preposterous claim by economist Alan Blinder that losing the U.S. television industry was a success: I disagree [that it’s a success to lose the “commodity” television industry]. Not only did we lose an untold number of jobs, we broke the chain of experience that is so important in technological evolution. As happened with batteries, abandoning today’s “commodity” manufacturing can lock you out of tomorrow’s emerging industry. [133] In other words, innovation without an advanced industrial commons becomes much harder, and the ability to scale any innovations that occur, even harder. Figure 4: Components of an industrial commons [134] As noted, foreign policy thinking is largely devoid of sophisticated analysis of industries, much less power industries. Conventional economics is only a bit better, but generally assumes that barriers to entry—difficulties for entrepreneurs or existing businesses to enter a competitor’s line of business—are generally small, and to the extent they are not, are a result of patents, government regulations, or unfair competition, the latter of which antitrust authorities must be ever vigilant against. Indeed, their ideal world is one of perfect competition, wherein entry barriers are zero. Prominent Austrian school (free market) economist Ludwig Von Mises spoke for many economists when he wrote, “The freedom to enter any business is essential to the preservation of the free enterprise.” [135] Milton Friedman agreed: “The greatest enemy of freedom has been concentrated power.” [136] And the neo-Brandeisians have the same view but for different reasons. Where the free-market conservatives envision an economy with no entry barriers because it enables freedom and maximizes “market forces,” the neo-Brandeisians want it because they hate capitalist profits. This is wrong even without considering China. As Joseph Schumpeter rightly argued, the barriers to entry that innovative firms often create are always temporary. This is why Schumpeter wrote, “Profit … is the premium put upon successful innovation in capitalist society and is temporary by nature: it will vanish in the subsequent process of competition and adaptation.” [137] In other words, if the best an entrepreneur could hope for was making back the cost of capital, there would be little innovation. After competitive failure of U.S. firms from Chinese aggression, the idea that the United States can easily get back in the market is fanciful. The reality is that there are many interconnected factors that can create significant barriers for companies attempting to enter advanced industries. But it is even more wrong when considering Chinese competition because it uses the massive power of the CCP to break down U.S. barriers of competition to not enable market forces to work, but rather to vanquish their business foes. For the purposes of the discussion here, that means that after competitive failure of U.S. firms from Chinese aggression, the idea that the United States can easily get back in the market is fanciful. In other words, if more American companies in power industries fail or are seriously weakened to the point where they are much smaller, it is likely that those losses will be permanent. Even if the USG woke up and on a bipartisan basis realized that the United States must rebuild that lost capacity, it would be extremely difficult and enormously expensive. That is why, as discussed ahead, it is so critical to slow the relative loss of power industries to China. Table 1, from a 1990 survey of U.S. firms, identifies multiple barriers to entry, with absolute cost advantages being the most important. Capital requirements are ranked second. In other words, some industries require large amounts of capital investment to enter. While economists may dismiss barriers to entry, firms take them deadly seriously because they are the core thing business leaders rightly work for. Table 1: Barriers to market entry ranked by U.S. firms in 1990 [138] Barriers Mean Std. Dev. Absolute cost advantages held by incumbent firms 4.13 0.90 Capital requirements to enter markets 4.11 0.98 Incumbents with superior production processes 3.91 0.94 Capital intensity of the market 3.84 0.91 Incumbents with proprietary product technology 3.81 1.02 Customer loyalty advantage held by incumbents 3.79 0.97 Incumbents with cost advantages due to economies of scale 3.71 0.85 Amount of sunk cost involved in entering a market 3.69 1.00 R&D expense involved in entering a market 3.63 1.02 Low prices charges by incumbents 3.61 0.81 Access to distribution channels 3.53 1.10 Magnitude of market share held by incumbents 3.50 0.87 Number of firms in a market 3.49 0.94 Brand identification advantage held by incumbents 3.38 1.04 Incumbents with cost advantages due to learning curves 3.32 0.90 Amount of selling expense involved in marketing a product 3.22 0.98 Customers’ costs associated with switching from one supplier to another 3.17 1.07 Expected post-entry reaction of incumbents 3.16 0.98 Trade secrets held by incumbent firms 3.15 1.11 Incumbents possessing strategic raw materials 3.09 1.17 Incumbents with relatively easy access to raw materials 2.78 0.96 Incumbents with government subsidies 2.76 1.38 High profit rates earned by incumbents 2.63 1.14 Heavy advertising by firms already in the market 2.54 0.92 Government licensing requirements 2.20 0.99 There are at least nine major kinds of barriers to reentry. The most formidable obstacle is often the accelerated pace of technological advancement that occurs during a company’s absence. In advanced industries, knowledge compounds rapidly, and the technological gap can become insurmountable. Companies lose access to cutting-edge research, miss critical patent opportunities, and lose design capabilities—and their technical workforce disperses to competitors or just atrophies. The tacit knowledge embedded in organizational routines, process technology and layout, and employee expertise is particularly difficult to reconstruct. Reentry typically demands massive up-front investments in R&D, manufacturing capabilities, and infrastructure. Advanced industries often require specialized equipment, clean rooms, or complex supply chains that represent sunk costs with limited alternative uses. Financial markets may view reentry attempts skeptically, making capital more expensive or difficult to obtain. This is especially true in the United States where most markets want quick and certain returns. The company must also compete against established players with proven track records. During a company’s absence, market concentration may have increased, with remaining competitors strengthening their positions through consolidation, economies of scale, or network effects. This is particularly the case after Chinese firm market expansion. Established players often have preferential access to key suppliers, distribution channels, and talent pools. Moreover, customer relationships in B2B advanced industries are typically long term and trust based, making market penetration extremely challenging for returning entrants. In most cases, there are customer switching costs. Often the only way of entry is massive cost reductions or, if possible, a significant increase in the value proposition. Brand is another barrier to entry. If the competitor’s brand is strong, it’s hard to get into a market. To date, Chinese firms are generally not strong in brand, but that is changing. Advanced industries frequently involve complex regulatory environments that evolve continuously. Companies lose institutional knowledge about compliance requirements, relationships with regulatory bodies, and understanding of approval processes. New regulations may have emerged that create additional barriers, and the cost of achieving compliance from scratch can be prohibitive. This is especially the case when American companies try to reenter overseas markets. Specialized talent in advanced industries is often scarce and highly mobile. During the exit period, key personnel typically join competitors or leave the industry entirely. As we have seen with China, sometimes American talent actually goes and works for Chinese firms. If there are few firms in the United States with the demand for this specialized talent, the worker’s skills atrophy and are not used. Rebuilding teams requires not only recruiting individual experts but also reconstructing the collaborative knowledge networks and organizational capabilities that enable innovation and execution. Advanced industries often rely on complex ecosystems of specialized suppliers, research institutions, complementary service providers, and training institutions. These relationships take years to develop and may have become exclusive or capacity-constrained during the company’s absence. Reentry may require simultaneously rebuilding multiple interdependent relationships across the value chain. A factor that is given little attention, yet is important, is the barriers to entry when enough national power industries have lost market share or gone out of business, and therefore the pressure on government to adopt national power industry support policies. We can see that in a country such as Canada, which has deindustrialized so much and has so few advanced technology firms that the voices of high-end, knowledge-based firms that need strong government advanced industry policies are at best a whisper. Instead, companies that want cheap immigrant labor, banks and other financial services firms, and natural resource companies that want more rights to extract minerals and other materials dominate Canadian politics. To the extent advanced technology firms exist, they are dominated by small Canadian-owned firms that want handouts rather than a leg up. So, to the extent the Canadian government would put in place advanced industry techno-economic strategy, it would have to have capabilities for independent action that it does not now possess. The lobbying forces of other firms are just too strong. The United States is fortunate because it still has enough of a critical mass of large technology firms that press the USG to not put in place ill-advised anti-national power industry policies and to put in place favorable ones. But each weakening or death of an American national power industry firm with a Washington government-relations budget serves as one more barrier to reentry for the nation as whole. The United States is fortunate because it still has enough of a critical mass of large technology firms that press the USG to not put in place ill-advised anti-national power industry policies and to put in place favorable ones. Industries evolve through cycles of technological paradigms, and companies that exit during one paradigm may find the next cycle dominated by different technologies or business models. The timing of reentry attempts relative to industry cycles, product life cycles, and competitive dynamics can determine success or failure. The interaction between these factors creates what economists call “path dependency,” wherein a company’s current competitive position is heavily influenced by its historical choices and market evolution during its absence. This explains why even well-resourced companies with strong track records in other industries often struggle to successfully reenter advanced sectors in which they previously competed. Consumer welfare economics assumes that factor price adjustments lead to equilibrium. If a company loses market share, it cuts prices and regain it. But the reality, especially in capital- and research-intensive industries, is that market share loss can trigger a downward cumulative causation cycle. As figure 5 shows, less revenue can lead to less reinvestment in R&D which means that next-generation products either are not as goods as the competitors’ or enter the market late, in both cases reducing market share and sales even more. With fewer sales, capital investment budgets are cut, meaning that the company has a harder time investing in the most modern equipment, leading to slower productivity growth and reduced cost competitiveness, with other firms taking even more market share. And both factors lead to less innovation and less market share, with the downward cycle continuing to repeat unless the competitor firm makes a serious error or the core firm is able to discover a breakthrough innovation that lets it back in the game. Figure 5: The downward process Unlike most U.S. policymakers who either ignore barriers to entry or do everything possible to lower them to boost competition, even if it means that Chinese firms enter the U.S. market, most Chinese policymakers deeply understand techno-economic and trade factors and dynamics, including barriers to entry and how to overcome foreign barriers and then maintain their own. And that is why they work so hard to erect them, including promoting mergers, limiting foreign company access to Chinese markets, and providing subsidies so Chinese companies can attack foreign company margins with deep discounts below cost. At one level, it appears difficult for companies attempting to attack or disrupt established players in advanced industries. After all, these companies should have many of the barriers to entry previously described. But there are ways firms can successfully attack. And, as discussed, the CCP provides support for these attacks. Attacking companies should focus on periods when incumbents are most vulnerable, including during technological transitions, regulatory changes, and market disruptions. For example, when many U.S. companies were retrenching in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, and again during the 2020 COVID crisis, Chinese companies, backed by the CCP, kept up, and even accelerated their rate of investment. When markets came back to “normal,” they had gained market share at the expense of more prudent and market-driven Western companies. In the transition to 5G wireless, state-backed Huawei pushed hard to get into markets in developing nations, precluding Western companies from getting in, and thus setting themselves up for next generation sales. In the United States, companies such as Tesla succeeded by timing their entry during the EV transition when traditional automakers were slow to adapt. The CCP understood where the global market was going and not only subsidized its EV providers but also spurred EV demand through government policies (reduced taxes on EVs, better access to roads, etc.) This enabled the Chinese EV makers to sell massive numbers of vehicles in China and, as a result, gain scale economies and learning by doing. Western vehicle makers are rightly focused on current limited consumer demand for EVs, but now have been seriously disadvantaged in their efforts to move into the new EV markets. Only the Biden EV tariffs have prevented significant damage. China has done this in a range of other industries, including solar panels and drones, and is seeking a similar victory in industries such as robots, including humanoid robots. Most Chinese policymakers deeply understand techno-economic and trade factors and dynamics, including barriers to entry and how to overcome foreign barriers and then maintain their own. MIT business scholar Clay Christenssen argued that attackers seldom attack at the top, most profitable segments. Rather, they usually attack from the bottom on segments that are less profitable, less innovation based, and more likely to be given up by incumbents. Rather than launch frontal attacks on incumbents’ core markets, which incumbents are more likely to fight to defend, successful attackers often focus on neglected segments, emerging applications, or underserved customer needs. This allows them to establish footholds without triggering immediate competitive responses, while building capabilities and market presence. They then use these gains, coupled with the erosion of sales and profits from the incumbents to steadily move up in their attacks. China has done this in many markets, focusing on more commodity-like products (e.g., bulk chemicals, legacy chips, lower-end mobile phones, LCD displays, etc.). This combination of “good enough” products at a much more competitive price point is often a winning combination, especially in the non-OECD world where price is a more important factor. That not only weakens the rich country incumbents who sell in those markets, but also gives the Chinese firms revenues to move up the value chain. Huawei’s rise to global dominance in telecom equipment is a case study in that strategy. Companies competing against other companies in normal countries have more ability to attack than Western companies do against Chinese attackers. Most importantly is IP. Often, an attacker will use IP from the defender without their permission, and the attacker can win in court, thus significantly blunting the attack; and if they receive damages, weakening the attacker. But that is much more difficult against a Chinese attacker, at least in the Chinese market, because Chinese courts are an instrument of Chinese national power industry strategy and seldom side with the non-Chinese company. And even in the home U.S. market, that can be difficult, as winning a court case or obtaining a Section 337 exclusion order from the U.S. International Trade Commission against an unfair competing Chinese firm can be costly and difficult, especially as the law requires a showing of immediate market share loss. Defenders often can successfully defend against attacks through exclusive supplier agreements or strategic partnerships. But these are not possible in China. In fact, the CCP will weaponize them against foreign companies to limit their access to Chinese suppliers in order to favor their CCP champion attacker. The most important weapons CCP-backed attackers have are a protected market (in China and Belt and Road nations) and massive subsidies. Take CCP company COMAC, which is competing with Boeing and Airbus in the commercial aircraft market. There is a reason why, before COMAC, there were only two companies. The entry barriers were extremely high given the knowledge and capital requirements. But despite being a duopoly, the competition between Boeing and Airbus was intense, with each fighting intensively for big orders with airlines around the world. This was a market that, absent state intervention or some completely disruptive innovation (e.g., a hypersonic space plane), was going to stay a duopoly for the foreseeable future. No sane commercial company would seek to enter the market, because it would mean losing billions of dollars for at least a decade or more. But that did not stop China. China vaulted over those barriers by providing massive subsidies, enticing and threatening foreign parts and systems providers to sell COMAC what it needed, and then reserving the Chinese market for COMAC and subsidizing entry in Belt and Road countries. That is how a Chinese company overcomes big barriers to entry. If the United States and the West are to avoid losing the national power industry war, they will need to adopt the correct overall strategy. That will likely prove daunting, at least for now, because the vast majority of expert voices on foreign and economics relations with China support the wrong strategies. China overcomes barriers to market entry by subsidizing state-backed industrial champions such as COMAC If this dynamic plays out as it has in some other industries, the result will be a cumulative causation decline of Boeing and Airbus. They are likely to lose massive sales revenue in China and many of the less developed nations that China seeks to sell to with extremely generous export financing. And that means they will have less money to invest in next-generation aircraft. That in turn will reduce future sales, and the cycle will continue until perhaps only one of the two companies is left. We could see the same dynamic playing out in EVs, and even advanced industries such as memory chips and biopharmaceuticals. Given that China is not a normal competitor, the only away of defending against this kind of attack is with a trade wall in OECD nations against these attacks. Ideally, as we will discuss next year in a report on policy recommendations, this would mean long-term exclusion orders against the sales in OECD nations of unfairly competing Chinese companies. But import bans are only one tool. If the United States and the West overall are to avoid losing the national power industry war, they will need to adopt the correct overall strategy. That will likely prove daunting, at least for now, because the vast majority of expert voices on foreign and economic relations with China support the wrong strategies. America needs a coherent strategy to shape, guide, and implement policy choices. Victory in a kinetic war often goes to the side with the best overall strategy. Strategic choices need to be made. When and where to attack? When to retreat? When to outflank versus when to conduct a frontal assault? How to best combine and coordinate forces? And even when to leave the battlefield and form a redoubt? The techno-economic and trade war with China is no different. First and foremost, it requires an acknowledgment of the reality of the war and hence the need for a strategy. Some simply refuse to see that America (and its allies) are being attacked, denying the existence of national power industries, ignoring the CCP’s stated intentions and long litany of aggression, and turning a blind eye to U.S. power industry injury and even death. Others say “war” is an incendiary and provocative term and that the United States and China are only in competition or, at worst, perhaps in a narrow “trade war” over a few industries. Many even assert that we are allies in addressing global challenges. Some even say that it doesn’t matter. After all, countries don’t compete. Or China is just trying to catch up. Or we benefit from trading with China. Or we need to engage with China. Etc. But we are in a techno-economic and trade war, and it does matter. Indeed, there is a potential tidal wave of value destruction headed at U.S. national power industries, as better funded and more financially patient Chinese competitors keep up their relentless global expansion. PRC champions are coming after Western firms in national power industries, and they will not stop. Indeed, the PRC’s is a scorched earth campaign, leaving no survivors, always maintaining the assault. And firms in U.S. and allied national power industries (including Europe) have nowhere to hide from this techno-economic blitzkrieg unless governments take action based on a coherent strategy. Overall, the issue of China is largely framed by international relations scholars and experts, not business and industrial strategy experts. The former are aware of such competition, but they largely see it as subservient to overall foreign policy considerations and goals. Moreover, few understand the operation of advanced industries, the nature of the competition and the importance of barriers to entry and reentry. As such, the prevailing narratives largely ignore the strategic threats that techno-economic and trade wars pose for U.S. power. When it comes to China, U.S. experts and pundits advance a number of strategic choices. Some put good relations with China above all other considerations. Some are based on a denial of the conflict. Others accept the conflict, but don’t see the need for a new strategy. Others are guided by Ricardian free trade theory with its overarching belief in trade as always being win-win. Many, including trade and foreign policy experts, are globalists in the sense that the world should be one with few or no trade barriers and open and sustained cooperation between nations—and if the allies continue to work with China, that world will emerge. There is a potential tidal wave of value destruction headed at U.S. national power industries, as better funded and more financially patient Chinese competitors keep up their relentless global expansion. Others hold an explicit or implicit derision of the United States, seeing it as a white, imperial nation, motivated by capitalist greed. Therefore, the United States should be dethroned as the global hegemon. And many who specialize in studying China get “captured” by China, seeing the world, at least partially, through its eyes. And due to the fact that the CCP rewards and punishes U.S. Chinese studies scholars based on whether it likes their views, many U.S. scholars trim their sails. Yet, collectively, these experts articulate a range of views and opinions that influence preferred strategic choice. As such, these choices need to be analyzed and assessed. For the sake of clarity, I provide analogies and titles reflective of strategic choices made in past wars, including WWII and in the conflict with the Soviet Union and how current strategic choices mirror those. Many of these proposed strategic approaches are offered by engagers, those policy experts and scholars who put engagement with China above all else. For them, nothing should get in the way of engagement. As such, they exaggerate and stress the supposed panoply of benefits from being solicitous to the CCP, and dismiss and downplay the actions the CCP takes that are against U.S. interests. The problem is that the days of engagement are, if they were ever legitimate to begin with, gone. Yet, engagers persist in out-of-date, flawed strategic framing. China scholar David Schambaugh has said about the engagers that “these were individuals who had spent their entire professional careers working to engage China. Now their life’s work was under attack, and many individuals were naturally defensive.” [139] There are several flavors of engagement. There is no question that the United State gave too much aid to the Soviet Union during WWII, enabling them to gain more ground in the West and emerge stronger after the war with Germany to become a global adversary with America. FDR was oblivious to the threat from Stalin and even saw “Uncle Joe” as someone he could work it. Today, one China strategy is to simply assume that there is no conflict, and that the opposite is even true: a strong China is good for the world. One article lists the cases for de-escalation and engagement: China accounts for global GDP growth. China drives global economic growth, so a sound bilateral relationship is important to American consumers and workers, as well as to families who are counting on stock market returns to pay for their retirement. In the 10 years through 2019, China, on average, accounted for about one third of global economic growth, larger than thecombinedshare. [140] Likewise, the U.S. China Business Council) has written, “ Today, the US-China trade relationship actually supports roughly 2.6 million jobs in the United States across a range of industries .” [141] Parroting the standard fare, an article in Foreign Affairs entitled “The Overreach of the China Hawks: Aggression Is the Wrong Response to Beijing” argues, “Closer ties with Beijing have led to Chinese acceptance of international rules in areas such as nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, arms control, and some aspects of global trade and finance. Engagement also brought China into the global economy and fueled economic growth worldwide.” [142] These comments about China fueling growth demonstrates the engagers’ ignorance of both domestic and international economics. They assume China boosted global growth because China imported some goods. But China consistently ran a trade surplus. The net effect on GDP in the rest of the world was negative, not positive, as GDP is lowered when X-M (exports minus imports) is negative. So yes, exports to China supports jobs in the United States, but imports to the United States from China take away jobs from the United States, and since the United States runs a massive trade deficit with China, the U.S. production economy has been weakened, even though consumers save a few bucks. Moreover, this framing reflects stale Keynesian demand-side thinking, suggesting that demand from China, rather than lower interest rates from the Fed, keeps the U.S. economy at full employment. U.S. full employment is not dependent in any way shape or form on what China does. Domestic demand should always equal domestic supply, and when it doesn’t, domestic monetary and fiscal policy help restore the balance. The reality is rather than the CCP helping global growth, it weakened it. The CCP’s price suppression of wages and other business costs at home led to reduced productivity worldwide, as rather than invest in automation at home, companies in high-wage economies moved production to low-wage, less automated China, lowering global growth. And as China unfairly dominated manufacturing, the opportunities to move up the value chain for developing economies shrank to nothing. And finally, as ITIF has shown, China’s unfair “innovation mercantilist strategies have lowered global innovation as less innovative Chinese firms unfairly took market share from more innovative Western firms. [143] The reality is that U. S. growth does not depend on Chinese growth or any other foreign economy growth; in the moderate term, it depends on U.S. domestic productivity growth and nothing else. Related to this is the foreign policy and international economy consensus that praises China for raising tens of millions out of poverty. An article by leading China experts in Foreign Affairs entitled “T he Overreach of the China Hawks: Aggression Is the Wrong Response to Beijing” argues, “It is true, as [Aaron] Friedberg asserts, that China’s leaders seek to harness economic growth to boost the nation’s international stature and power. But Friedberg insists that this goal overrides all other purposes, ignoring the very real ways in which growth has benefited huge numbers of Chinese citizens.” [144] This is truly a striking statement, echoing fellow traveler statements in the 1930s and 1940s, arguing that sure, while Stalin had show trials, purges, and gulags, at least he boosted growth. Since when does the welfare of an adversary’s citizens become of paramount concern for U.S. foreign policy? [145] What is even more striking is that if there is one thing China’s techno-economic strategy has not done is benefit huge numbers of Chinese citizens. The CCP’s entire strategy has been to immiserate the proletariat to invest in weapons—a massive military and massively subsidized national power industries. If you want to look at a Chinese territory that benefited its citizens over the same period of time, look at Taiwan. After the revolutionary overthrow of the legitimate Kuomintang government by the CCP in 1949, China and Taiwan had about the same GDP per capita. Today, Taiwan’s is almost three times greater. [146] One way to avoid having to deal with adversaries is to define them as allies, either by formal agreements, informal collaboration, or simply assuming a lack of adversariness. Stalin was so desperate to avoid war with Hitler that he blindly signed the Molotov/Ribbentrop Pact, hoping that Hitler would turn west instead of east and the capitalist powers would exhaust themselves, allowing Stalin to move in and conquer Western territory. But if Stalin had only read Mein Kampf , he would have realized that Hitler’s overarching goal was not to fight the West but to stamp out communism. Today, many U.S. foreign policy experts believe that the United States and China are allies in ensuring a safe and secure world. Indeed, this has been the default view of the U.S. foreign policy establishment for decades. A 1994 report by the Trilateral Commission argued that “China should be regarded more as an opportunity than a threat” and that the United States should seek to “incorporate China in the emerging world order.” [147] This view has changed little over time, as we see in a 2019 in an open letter in The Washington Post complaining about Trump’s more assertive policy toward China. Among seven key points made by over 100 prominent U.S. foreign policy scholars, including friends of China Stapleton Roy and Susan Thorton, was, “We do not believe Beijing is an economic enemy or an existential national security threat that must be confronted in every sphere.” [148] It goes on to state, “The fear that Beijing will replace the United States as the global leader is exaggerated.” I wonder if six years later any of the 100 signers would like to take back this last statement. Along a similar vein, leading China scholars Jude Blanchette and Ryan Hass have written: Instead of these two great nations pooling their considerable economic resources and human talent to jointly address the world’s many growing challenges, they lock horns in a multifaceted strategic competition. The blunt reality is that because of these deep divisions, there will be diseases that will not be cured, there will be children who will unnecessarily suffer, and our climate will continue to degrade as opportunities for global cooperation slip through humanity’s fingers. The mutual mistrust and strategic rivalry between the United States and China create barriers to innovation, collaboration, and the bold, unified action needed to tackle existential threats. In this fractured global landscape, the pursuit of dominance and security overshadows the shared responsibility to steward a livable future for all, leaving the world worse off. [149] They continued: Collaboration with China is essential to addressing climate change. And even amid trade wars and derisking, China remains an important economic and trading partner with the United States. Scientists of the two countries have collaborated with each other on important and meaningful basic research projects that benefit not only the two countries but all of humankind. One area of fruitful research is in agriculture… The common view is that the United States and China need to cooperate to address climate change, global terrorism, infectious diseases, and other global challenges. [150] Today, many U.S. foreign policy experts believe that the United States and China are allies in ensuring a safe and secure world. Those who assert that the United States and China are adversaries or even in competition with China are routinely excoriated by the cooperation camp. We see this in a vitriolic attack on a leading scholar in the China competition camp, Princeton University scholar Aaron Freidberg. A group of engagers wrote in Foreign Affairs —the journal of the engagers—that “Friedberg calls not for mere competition but for an antagonistic rivalry that minimizes any attempt at cooperation.” [151] They even wrote, “A pragmatic policy would recognize the value of economic ties with China and encourage continued Sino-U.S. cooperation in many critical areas, including technology.” [152] How exactly do they explain how Chinese technology and trade policy has helped the United States on net? They simply waive their hands and assert it. In other words, for this still powerful camp, cooperation is the paramount goal, and responding to Chinese aggression gets in the way by irritating our interlocutors. They are certainly right about the last part: yes, if the USG presses China on issues of true national concern and even survival, cooperation will be much harder. But if the USG does not, U.S. global leadership will be threatened. There are at least two major problems with the engagement camp. First, they are so focused on engagement for engagement’s sake that they come up with a seemingly endless litany of things we must engage on. Anything to keep engagement going. But presumably these issues are important to both the United States and China. In this case, why is the CCP not the supplicant to the USG, coming to Washington to ask the United States if it will cooperate with China and giving the United States concessions for doing so. Because only U.S. experts and pundits are this naïve. There is little evidence that the CCP sees things this way. It is happy to talk about win-win relations, but we should not take them at their word. The CCP uses the desire for cooperation to advance its own specific techno-economic predatory practices. CCP officials are happy to say they will cooperate on climate change as long as the United States does not press China on an issues such as IP theft. And in the past, the United States has naïvely taken that deal, believing it has gotten the best of it. Second, reflecting Stalin’s naïveté and desperation with Hitler, many U.S. officials and pundits assume that China will help America shoulder the heavy responsibility for global order, including open and fair trade. Nothing is further from the truth. The CCP does not want co-responsibility for global order; it wants sole responsibility so it can impose its version of global order. And when it comes to trade, China’s vision harkens back to British trade policy in the 1700s and 1800s, wherein Britain exported manufacturing goods to its empire and imported underpriced commodities. Given China’s history and current practice of massive mercantilism, the idea that anyone could actually respond to these claims with a straight face is truly astounding. Most importantly, engagement always comes at a price. The CCP and its leadership are realists, caring only about the CCP’s Marxist-Leninist interests. When CCP officials see the USG asking it for help for addressing a global problem, they always exact a price. If this litany of cooperation is of no real interest to China, then why are we pushing for them, when most of the issues are either related to global concerns (and why are these our concerns if addressing them comes at a cost to America?) or can be dealt with by the United States alone? A core reason, of course, is because so much of the U.S. foreign policy community puts governing the world ahead of advancing U.S. interests, especially techno-economic capabilities and strengths, something the engagers show absolutely no interest in. Most importantly, engagement always comes at a price. The CCP and its leadership are realists, caring only about the CCP’s Marxist-Leninist interests. When CCP officials see the USG asking it for help for addressing a global problem, they always exact a price. Sure, we will help you, but only if you have to back off key issues, especially our predatory trade, tech, and economic actions that are hurting your national power industry firms. It would be one thing if the factors the USG were being supplicants for truly mattered and could be addressed by “cooperation.” But the issues either don’t or can’t. Just look at the list of issues the USG constantly trots out as important to cooperate on. After the San Francisco summit of 2023 with Biden and Xi, the USG statement said that: the deliverables included more cooperation on artificial intelligence, a working group to promote tourism, cooperation in counter-narcotics, and combatting fentanyl trafficking, enhanced cooperation on climate change, an increase in airline flights, and people to people exchanges. [153] Later, National Security Council head Jake Sullivan said, “We are ready to coordinate on climate, health security, macroeconomic stability, and … risks posed by AI.” [154] Given that the Chinese cannot be negotiated with on issues of real concern, especially techno-economic and trade ones, rather than walk away and say that nothing was accomplished, the administration put on a happy face with these “important” issues of cooperation. No one ever asks, “Why do we need to cooperate on these?” They are seen as self-obvious. But they should be questioned, as they are either not needed, not important, or something countries can do on their own. Let’s look at each one: ▪ Artificial Intelligence. What for? The United States does not need to worry about any AI use in our country because Congress could enact a regulatory regime to govern AI if needed. We don’t worry about unsafe drugs from other nations because we have Federal Drug Administration drug approvals. AI is no different. Ahh, but what about the killer Terminator AI? What about it? It is science fiction, not reality. Even if it were reality, it’s in the CCP’s interest not to get terminated by AI too. We don’t need to cooperate. What about AI weapons? Does anyone really believe that America should limit its battlefield use on the basis of an agreement signed with the CCP? If you do, I have a bridge to sell you. ▪ Tourism promotion. Surely, they must be kidding. Who cares? And why would the United States want more Chinese tourists, and why do we need to cooperate with the CCP on it in anyway? ▪ Airline flights. Again, what? If we want more airline flights from China, the Federal Aviation Administration and U.S. airports can make that happen. And if the CCP wants more U.S. flights, it can do the same. ▪ People-to-people exchanges. See above re: airline flights. ▪ Cooperation in counter-narcotics. Is this not something the CCP is very interested in? If so, they can ask us for help. ▪ Combatting fentanyl trafficking. Okay, this is another one of “you must be kidding.” The CCP could stop the flow of fentanyl and precursors to the United States next week, but it chooses not to because they know it weakens America and strengthens China. ▪ Health security. Let me get this right. It is likely that a CCP lab created (with financial help from America’s National Institutes of Health) and inadvertently let loose the COVID-19 virus on the world and then proceeded to cover it up and manipulated the World Health Organization to do its bidding. We should cooperate with a government that did that? [155] This is something out of Orwell. ▪ Macroeconomic stability. With China having a long-running a massive trade surplus with the world while intentionally trying to deindustrialize the world, we should ask their help with macroeconomic stability? Wow. And again, presumably China has an interest in macroeconomic stability in the face of a global financial collapse or massive recession. So why are we the ones asking for it? ▪ And of course, wait for it… climate change. The big kahuna. But isn’t China concerned about climate change too? It is more vulnerable to climate change than the United States is given the larger share of its population at sea level and its lower per capita income. Why does the CCP not beg the United States to do more? Why should we implore them? And the reality is that climate change will never be solved until we get clean energy technology that costs the same or less as dirty. No amount of “cooperation” will help. The reality is that the CCP will keep increasing its emissions of greenhouse gases until it makes economic sense for it to stop. To be sure, it is important not to unilaterally cut off diplomatic ties with China. But the idea that we need China to help us on certain matters and that this means not pressing them harder for their techno-economic aggression against U.S. (and allied) companies and the U.S. economy is just the ultimate in naïveté. The reality is that we are long past the time when the USG could influence China policy in any meaningful way. The first Obama administration was the last time that was possible. Their power is just too great now. Let’s top being a supplicant and get on with defending our economy from Chinese techno-economic aggression. A good example of this view is from the Peterson Institute for International Relations. Ha Jiming (a scholar in China) and Adam Posen wrote: We all believe that China-U.S. trade has been clearly win-win, and will continue to be so if it is conducted by the rules of that order, and if those rules are consensually adapted to economic change. In fact, given the degree to which China has developed, the two economies have more fundamental economic interests in common now than before, including in safeguarding and abiding by that system. [156] They view the competition as normal and healthy, writing, “Chinese companies have a right to compete with U.S. companies and succeed in any sector, including in high-tech.” [157] They went on to state: While much has been made of Made in China 2025 and the earlier “indigenous innovation” programs, the Chinese government’s aspirations to make China a technological leader in some fields should not be considered a threat to the United States. Even some government subsidization of relevant R&D or technical education in this pursuit should not be inherently contentious. [158] In other words, in this view, global trade is always win-win, value maximizing, and pointing out that China is not a Ricardian trader but a power trader intent on dominance is simply “not cricket.” Peterson’s commitment to global integration and free trade is so blinding and all-encompassing that it simply cannot admit that China is not playing by global welfare-maximizing rules. No worry, it will all work out; the natural global division of labor will prevail. Likewise, Ryan Hass at the Brookings Institution wants the United States not to be overly harsh with China, including on techno-economic issues, so that we can work cooperatively on global challenges such as global warming. [159] As part of his naïveté toward communist regimes, including the CCP, George Marshall proposed the “Marshall Plan: to extend aid to the Soviets in part to bring them closer to the United States.” [160] Stalin clearly had no interest in taking our money or becoming closer. Likewise, the United States has long supported aid to China to keep them engaged. As Shambaugh wrote, the Carter administration saw that “science and tech was the perfect medium to keep the Chinese engaged given Beijing’s own prioritization on modernization.” [161] Carter’s agreement stated, “Affirming that such cooperation can strengthen friendly relations between both countries.” [162] In 2006, the State Department wrote of the agreement, “The S&T Agreement has withstood the test of political turmoil and has provided a stabilizing influence on U.S.— Sino relations.” [163] According to the Congressional Research Service, U.S. AID and the State Department provided over $417 million in aid to China between 2001 and 2017. [164] The U.S.-supported World Bank still provides funding to China. [165] Even the Department of War provides funding to Chinese research universities. [166] In other words, helping Ch ina grow its national power industries by sharing U.S. science and technology is good because it keeps the CCP favorable toward America. Clearly, this did not stop China from engaging in massive IP theft and forced technology transfer against U.S. companies. The foreign policy Left loves to advance the narrative that it was Harry Truman’s hawkishness, not FDR’s coddling of “Uncle Joe” Stalin, that caused the Cold War. Stalin just wanted to be left alone. Of course, this framing is ideological nonsense. Stalin was always the aggressor, and all Truman did was help America wake up to it. Today, this narrative is applied to the United States and China. If only the United States, and in particular China hawks, would just stop pressing China, CCP leaders would become more reasonable. As early as 1998, a review of Peter Rodman’s book Between Friendship and Rivalry: China and America in the 21st Century (Rodman was deputy national security advisor in the Reagan administration) stated that there is a “drift toward strategic rivalry between China and the United States, but that it can be slowed or reversed if the two sides find common ground on such strategic issues as Korea, Pakistan, regional stability, and the Asian economic crisis.” [167] In other words, if we don’t cooperate with China, they will try to become our rival. [168] Foreign policy professor Charles Glaser agrees, writing that “China’s Rise Can Be Peaceful If the U.S. Doesn’t Provoke It.” [169] As David Shambaugh wrote, this camp argues that “it was not China’s fault or actions that had caused the relationship to deteriorate so precipitously, it was America’s fault!” [170] Some go even harder on this blame game. A report for the Quincy Institute, an organization that emphasizes military restraint and diplomatic engagement and cooperation, states: An alternative China policy would foreground internationalism, global cooperation, and multilateral efforts against climate change, public health dangers, and global inequality. Such an approach would not only reduce bilateral tensions, it would also confront the root causes of great power conflict and the rise of illiberal politics in China, the United States, and around the world. [171] If we just got rid of capitalism, the CCP would like us more. I am sure it would. When Labour, Liberal, and Conservative parties in Britain in the 1930s started to wake up to the threat from German National Socialism, certain segments of British society were sympathetic to Hitler, especially Oswald Mosley’s “black shirt” movement. Today, while not as explicit or perhaps extreme, there are some whose strategy is that the United States should do everything possible to get close to China, downplaying its Marxist-Leninist nature and seeking friendship. The leading organization with this view is the National Committee on U.S. China Relations (NCUSR). It has written, worryingly, that “more than three-quarters of Americans hold an unfavorable view of China.” [172] Rather than accept that Americans may be onto something (e.g., Uyghur oppression, lack of Chinese citizen freedom, closed U.S. factories, aggression toward Taiwan, etc.) NCUSR’s “Public Intellectuals Program is trying to change that.” [173] In other words, it would like to see these three-quarters of Americans hold a favorable view of China. And as such, its strategy is to do everything to keep relations strong. NCUSR tells us that China has a massive military not because of external aggression, but because it needs to control tensions at home. [174] It tells us that China is not the only one that sees U.S. global leadership as problematic, and China needs to have much greater say in shaping global affairs. [175] The progressive Left, with its global-proletariat and anti-U.S. views, also embraces this perspective. For many of them, having China replace the United States as the global hegemon would be a welcome relief. Another is “The Committee of 100,” a group of Chinese Americans chaired by former ambassador to China Gary Locke. The group objects to policies limiting China. For example, it opposes legislation limiting Chinese nationals’ ability to buy U.S. farmland. [176] It argues that investigations and prosecutions of Chinese spies and IP thieves were racial profiling, even though it is clear that the CCP is massively supportive of IP theft in the United States, and there were no investigations of other Asian nationalities. [177] The progressive Left, with its global-proletariat and anti-U.S. views, also embraces this perspective. For many of them, having China replace the United States as the global hegemon would be a welcome relief. Even CCP fellow travelers such as Columbia’s Jeffrey Sachs are in this camp. [178] Sachs, a “useful idiot” to the CCP, publishes articles in the state-run journal China Daily about U.S. decline and the problems with U.S. hegemony and how China needs to become a global leader. [179] Sachs actually appears on Chinese TV news shows urging China and other countries to cooperate to resist the United States. [180] His message: Trump is a bad nationalist; Xi is a wonderful globalist. [181] And he believes that China is the economic model for much of the rest of the world, especially developing nations, despite the fact that Chinese industrialization has meant the stagnation of industrial development in other developing nations. [182] He straight up argues that the U.S. should not be the leader of the world. And he has told the CCP’s Global Times that he “regrets U.S. foreign policy toward China.” [183] Jeff, perhaps you should instead teach in China? Another flavor of this capitulation is that, in large part because of severe structural disfunctions in the United States, mostly due to Trump, China will overtake us as the global hegemon. But that’s okay because the world needs someone to lead. Better China than a post-hegemonic world of chaos. C. Fred Bergsten, former head of the Peterson Institute, exemplified this view in his 2022 book The United States vs. China: The Quest for Global Economic Leadership . [184] Bergsten is the dean emeritus of the U.S. foreign economic policy community, especially when it comes to global economic issues. And this book reflects that community’s bias. He wrote about China seeking global leadership, which he views as simply tough competition, not a zero-sum battle to win the war for national power industries. In fact, the book is largely sympathetic and optimistic toward China. In Bergsten’s conception, someone needs to lead the world order, and if it can’t be the United States, China should step up. He (wrongly) sees China as “the largest engine of growth for the world economy,” (see above) and (wrongly) says that Chinese cooperation with the U.S. is critical to solving key global challenges (see above). [185] And rather than discuss China’s predatory policies, he wrote (wrongly) that “China is now emphasizing domestic rather than international drivers of growth” (written just before China doubled its global trade surplus). In fact, the CCP has been trotting out the promise of rebalancing to domestic consumption for over 15 years and American policymakers still believe them—like Charlie Brown believes Lucy will really hold the football this time. And amazingly, he blames both China and the United States for the problems from COVID‑19. He then wrote that once China catches up to the United States, it will become a responsible stakeholder and stop “cheating.” (This is remarkably similar to what the advocates of China’s WTO accession said in the late 1990s). He touts China’s global economic leadership record, admitting that, sure, they have a few problems with mercantilism, but he is convinced that they will outgrow them once they catch up. But of course, that is like saying that once Stalin conquered most of the world, he would give up on his military aggression. By the time China becomes “responsible,” it will have won the war. If the CCP truly wants to help with global governance, it can start by dismantling its mercantilist techno-economic war machine and compete on the same basis other nations do. Bergsten then gets to the key point: the CCP’s main and overarching priority is to stay in power, not to dominate the world. And of course, he reminds us, don’t forget the power of the Western-oriented liberal reformers in the CCP. Thus, his conclusion is that the United States should assist China in elevating itself on the global stage and in more global institutions so that China can help us solve the world’s problems. The Carnegie Endowment agrees, writing in a volume on U.S.-China relations that “the United States and China have a joint interest in finding a modus vivendi that provides the context for continued peace, prosperity, and national flourishing.” [186] If the CCP truly wants to help with global governance, it can start by dismantling its mercantilist techno-economic war machine and compete on the same basis other nations do. Many of the preferred strategic choices come from those who are so convinced of America’s superiority and China’s structural flaws that there is nothing to worry about. These strategies council patience and no need for fundamental U.S. policy change. After President Truman and others sounded the alarm on the Soviets’ global ambitions, few if any could ignore the Soviet Challenge. George Kenan, the architect of Soviet containment, argued that the Soviet Union would naturally self-destruct and counseled containment. And he was right about the outcome. But it took more than 40 years for that to happen, and the United States emerged victorious and dominant. Today, one thing both Xi and Trump have done is to make it harder to ignore that China is a pacing competitor to the United States. And so, some U.S. China scholars and pundits feel that they cannot ignore that China challenge. But for those who finally now, albeit grudgingly, see China as a competitor, the preferred strategy is to Kennan-like wait for China to naturally decline. The idea is that just as with the Soviet Union, eventually, because of a raft of internal contradictions, the Chinese economy, and perhaps even the CCP, will self-destruct, and then China will no longer be a threat. Let’s just contain China and all will be well. The problem, as discussed ahead, is that even with the Soviet union’s rampant spying and IP theft from the West, it has never had the capability to structurally weaken America’s power industries. China does and will likely win well before it—if it even does—becomes a democracy. In 1998, right before China’s growth accelerated even more, economist Nick Lardy wrote a book about China’s unfinished revolution and argued, “ Those who magnify the ‘China threat’ by extrapolating from China’s past growth rates are seriously mistaken.” [187] Indeed, they were mistaken because, in contrast to Lardy’s pessimism, China grew even faster in the 2000s. But for neoclassical trade economists, there is no way a state-controlled economy can grow consistently. Not only that, but Lardy argued that continued growth depends on the CCP to surrender a great deal of economic and political power because, as we all know, state-directed capitalism is a failure. It is the strong desire to avoid facing the bracing reality that the United States has never in its history faced such a serious geopolitical threat that makes this kind of “wait for Chinese decline” so appealing. He then advocated that the United States needed to assist in China’s enterprise and bank restructuring program. Here he was right, because if China had followed Lardy’s neoclassical advice and its banks had focused on only making money rather than on fueling China’s national power industries, China would not be the techno-economic power it is today. More recently, John Mueller, a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute wrote, “The lesson of the Cold War is not about the value of persistent containment in breaking your adversary’s will and sapping its power. It is about the wisdom of standing back, keeping your cool, and letting the contradictions in your opponent’s system become apparent.” [188] In other words, for free-market ideologues, the Chinese economy must self-destruct because it violates the free-market creed. In addition, it is the strong desire to avoid facing the bracing reality that the United States has never in its history faced such a serious geopolitical threat that makes this kind of “wait for Chinese decline” so appealing. No need for the intellectually and emotionally difficult desire to reassess long held and deeply committed to ideas and doctrines. No need to question whether the current American techno-economic and trade system will suffice to respond effectively to the challenge. No need to retool one’s intellectual framework to adjust to new realities. This is why any and all bits of bad news out of China are leaped on by so many as evidence of China’s impending doom. China has too much internal competition. [189] Chinese firms have low profits. China has a housing bubble. China has a demographic challenge. [190] Chinese millionaires are fleeing. In 2021, The New York Times published an opinion piece entitled “How Will We Win the Second Cold War?” arguing that we will win by doing nothing and letting China self-destruct. [191] The article pointed to “the inner weakness that the regime can’t get rid of because it’s part of its DNA.” Ahh, that is comforting. We can continue our ways, and the problem will take care of itself. A Project Syndicate article agreed: “No matter what China does, its economy’s momentum will be sapped by an aging, shrinking labor force, past overdrafts of public spending, and weak consumption. While the country is often now compared to Japan three decades ago, its outlook is actually much bleaker.” [192] But to blindly assert that China will collapse because it has a broken economic model (i.e., not America’s) is the height of hubris and wish fulfillment. As the author of the Atlantic Council report “The Longer Telegram” wrote, China is: more dexterous in survival than its Soviet counterpart, aided by the fact that China has studied carefully, over more than a decade, “what went wrong” in the Soviet Union. It would therefore be extremely hazardous for US strategists to accept that an effective future US China strategy should rest on an assumption that the Chinese system is destined to inevitably collapse from within. [193] A bit like die-hard Marxists in the 1980s and 1990s still holding onto the view that capitalism must collapse of its own weight and internal contradictions, these China critics just counsel patience. Don’t worry, the collapse is coming. There is little evidence that if the “reformers” gained power they would not continue their practice of power economics and goal of dominating national power industries. Some alternative history advocates have explored what would have happened if the United Kingdom had supported the assassination of Hitler, surmising that the Nazi replacement leader would not have been as militarily aggressive. Today, related to the view that China is on autopilot to self-destruct is the view that it is Xi Jinping that is the problem and when he leaves power, China will go back to normal cooperation. They assert that things were workable before him and when he and those in his camp lose power, as they surely must, conflict will significantly lesson. Perhaps the best example of this is from “The Longer Telegram” report, wherein the author wrote that: the central focus of an effective US and allied China strategy must be directed at the internal fault lines of domestic Chinese politics in general and concerning Xi’s leadership in particular. A fundamental error of US strategy has been to attack China as a whole, thereby enabling Xi’s leadership to circle the wagons within Chinese politics around the emotional pull of Chinese nationalism and civilizational pride. Just as significant an error has been to crudely attack the Chinese Communist Party itself. However, the political reality is that the party is divided on Xi’s leadership where he threatens the lives, careers, and deeply held policy positions of many within its senior political echelons. [194] He went on to write that “all US political and policy responses to China’s current strategy should be focused through the single lens of Xi himself.” [195] The 2019 Open Letter authors agree, stating,: “Efforts to isolate China will simply weaken those Chinese intent on developing a more humane and tolerant society.” [196] They went on to write, “The United States should encourage Chinese participation in new or modified global regimes in which rising powers have a greater voice.” [197] In other words, let’s not rock the boat and the “anti-Xi’s” will emerge and we can get back to friendly, win-win relations. Whether CCP reformers can gain power is beyond the scope of this report. Given Xi’s Marxist-Leninist extremism, it certainly couldn’t hurt. But to assume that the problem is Xi and not the inherent logic and goals of the CCP expressed since its very formation is to naïvely misinterpret China’s long-term goals. Deng Xiaoping had the same goals as Xi; he just knew that he had to bide his time and hide his light. There is little evidence that if the “reformers” gained power they would not continue their practice of power economics and goal of dominating national power industries. They might do it in more subtle and less aggressive ways because they would believe that it was a better way to achieve their goal, but domination would still be their goal. There is a related strategy that some hold on to and that is to wait until the CCP is finally replaced. Perhaps this is possible if enough Chinese become truly middle class and the then current generation can’t remember China’s abject poverty. However, unlike Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, which shifted to democracy when they got to a certain level of development, the United States is not directly influencing and pressing China to open up and become democratic. And the CCP appears to want to hold on to power vastly more than Asian Tiger autocrats did. More fundamentally, assuming that China eventually follows the democratic path of other Asian Tigers, by then the techno-economic war will long be over, with the United States and the West having lost much of their national power industry base. A vast techno-industrial destruction would be left in the wake. Unchecked, China could very well take over the global semiconductor industry, the chemical industry, AI, electronics, robotics, aerospace, biopharmaceuticals, precision instruments, and more. Chamberlin’s deal with Hitler was premised on the notion that Hitler only wanted to reunite former German territory. That may have been right in the West; it definitely was not in the East, as anyone who had read Mein Kampf would have understood. Today, there is a similar strategic response, especially from European policymakers. Many in the EU believe that the CCP has no desire for global strategic industry dominance; it simply wants its own strategic industries, just like Europe wants to not be dependent on Trump’s America. The EU Parliament has written that China’s “drive for ‘self-reliance’ in strategic sectors aims to lessen dependence on foreign technology, bolstering resilience and reducing vulnerability.” [198] The problem with this view is twofold. First, China is achieving that by closing its markets to foreign companies, something Europe is not willing to do in response to China’s mercantilism because it still believes in the vision of the WTO. Second, and more importantly, the CCP wants domination, not just self-reliance. Self-reliance lessens its dependency on adversaries. Domination gives it leverage over adversaries. The CCP’s entire Belt and Road and “going out” strategies are premised on attack and conquer, not just industrial defense of its homeland. Many in the EU believe that the CCP has no desire for global strategic industry dominance; it simply wants its own strategic industries, just like Europe wants to not be dependent on Trump’s America. Before World War II, the French military high command and political leadership assumed that its forces were superior to Germany’s. It had more men under arms, its tanks were considered superior, and it had the Maginot Line. This led both the civilian and military leadership to become overconfident, failing to spend money to rearm. At the same time, it led the French military to become complacent in strategy, planning to fight a long, protracted war, not a response to Guderian’s blitzkrieg tank pincer formations. [199] Today’s version of this is widely believed in U.S. foreign policy circles. It holds that China hawks overstate Chinese capabilities and that the United States has enormous strengths that will lead us to automatically prevail in techno-economic competition. Jude Blanchette and Ryan Hass exemplify this view: Even with its many shortcomings and vulnerabilities, the United States continues to command a strategic depth that China fundamentally lacks: a unique combination of economic vitality, global military superiority, remarkable human capital, and a political system designed to promote the correction of errors. The resilient and adaptable U.S. economy has the world’s deepest and most liquid capital markets and unparalleled influence over the global financial system. The United States continues to attract top global talent, including many Chinese nationals now fleeing their country’s autocratic political environment. Put plainly, the United States still has a vital edge over China in terms of economic dynamism, global influence, and technological innovation. [200] They wrote in answer to the question, “Is China destined to be an economic superpower?”: No. China has made huge, genuine strides in the past four decades, becoming dominant in manufacturing, prominent in many supply chains, and a leader in several high-tech sectors. However, China’s economy has major structural challenges that will constrain growth, and its current economic strategy, which is rooted in pursuing technology leadership, is depressing growth due to industrial-policy waste and growing tensions with trading partners. Going forward, China could encounter a crisis, muddle through with low growth, or revive growth with a more market-oriented strategy. As reports in this series have definitely shown that is simply wishful thinking that relies on ideological platitudes and not on careful analysis of firms, industries and innovation systems. The preponderance of evidence suggests that China has vastly more manufacturing capabilities than America, including and especially in national power industries, and is making much faster progress in innovation. [201] It is common for supporters of the view of U.S. superiority to point to U.S. universities, venture capital, high-skill immigration, and entrepreneurial culture as inherent sources of superiority. Many even still cling to the notion that U.S. manufacturing is strong. Professor and commentator Jerry Harr reflected this view when he wrote, “Examining U.S. manufacturing competitiveness today, one finds that the United States maintains a formidable position in global manufacturing despite facing intensifying international competition.” [202] Yet, comparing U.S. advanced industry output with China’s shows how far behind the United States is. [203] Most U.S. holders of free-market doctrine dismiss the China threat because they believe that free-market economies are inherently superior to more planned economies. A related view comes from CSIS. Its lead China analyst informed, “The United States needs to remember that it has not fallen behind China.” [204] But nowhere on the CSIS China Power project website is any analysis of China’s attempts to master advanced technology industries or any assessment of its progress and success. And to the extent it discusses China’s actions in this realm, it largely suggests that it will fail, presumably just as it has done in steel, EVs, batteries, drones, telecom equipment, solar panels, and high-speed rail. [205] Most U.S. holders of free-market doctrine dismiss the China threat because they believe that free-market economies are inherently superior to more planned economies. As such, there is no way we can lose, unless we become more like China. John Tamny, editor of RealClearMarkets , wrote, “The overblown China panic serves as a reminder of why the U.S. must maintain the market-friendly norms that have long made it the envy of the world.” [206] Box 3: U.S. Optimism: Command of Commerce: America’s Enduring Power Advantage Over China One of the more important questions to get right is whether the United States or China has more techno-economic and trade leverage over the other and what the trend in that dynamic is going. A new book, Command of Commerce , addresses this issue. [207] As the title suggests, it’s not an even, close contest: America dominates. But the authors’ methods and analysis are fundamentally flawed. First, their key claim for U.S. superiority is that U.S. multinationals have a much larger share of profits than Chinese do. But as noted, that’s largely because Chinese firms are willing to accept lower profits (in part because of government subsidies) in order to capture global market share. U.S. firms are not. Moreover, a higher share of Chinese firms are in more competitive segments where profits are low. For example, the profitability of electronics assembly firms is quite low compared with software firms. Does that not mean that being able to make things is not important to national power? They also see profits from sales and marketing as key indicators of national strength. For them, an American firm that outsources low-margin production overseas but makes high profits because of sales and marketing boosts U.S. power. No, it weakens it, even if they argue that higher profits help a nation. They do, but profits are a small share of national income, around 14 percent in the United States. [208] Second, like so many U.S. foreign policy and economic experts, the authors focus on firm nationality and not production location. In the authors’ analysis, a firm such as Boeing or Intel could offshore all its production to China and U.S. power would not diminish because these are U.S. firms. In fact, they argued, power would increase because the USG could order these U.S. firms to stop production in China at any time. But in a war, what matters is not production in other nations, especially your adversaries; it’s production at home. They wrote, “For a nation to be able to transform its manufacturing output into geopolitical leverage it needs to have significant influence over the more complicated manufacturing and design activities that feed into most products, and it needs to have control over where those products are sold.” [209] In other words, they asserted that a U.S. company that designs a product but has it made in Chinese factories, and then sold through the U.S. company’s distribution channel has geopolitical leverage. At one level, it does. The USG can tell it to stop producing in China, although that would mean major job loss and possible bankruptcy of the U.S. company, as sales would crater before it could establish new production facilities somewhere else. But it also means that the U.S. does not have this production domestically. To the extent the industry is dual use, or even enabling, that absence weakens U.S. defense production. And to the extent the United States relies on the products made by a U.S. company in China, it would be cutting off its nose to spite its face. Third, the authors did rightly point to a key metric as allied production strength (even if profits are their key measure). But it’s not at all clear that our allies are really our allies when it comes to China. South Korea and Japan are increasingly split in their loyalties, while the EU, in the face of Trump’s tariffs, is tilting East, not West. Indeed, the EU has still not cut off sales of Huawei 5G equipment within Europe because some EU nations want to save a few euros by buying Chinese. And overall, EU leaders are loathe to give up Chinese markets, which explains why they do so little to embrace U.S. export controls on China. [210] Fourth, the authors ignored important measures. They failed to mention that in 2024 the United States ran a $1.3 trillion trade deficit, with $300 billion of that with China. China ran a $900 billion merchandise trade surplus. [211] Over the last decade, U.S. manufacturing value-added output has grown more slowly than GDP and 14 of 19 major industries saw absolute decline. [212] Moreover, U.S. manufacturing productivity has been stagnant since the early 2010s. [213] While there does not appear to be easily accessible data on Chinese labor productivity growth, overall Chinese productivity growth has been significantly higher than that of the United States. [214] The fact that China now has installed 74 percent more industrial robots per manufacturing worker than the United States has, and installed 7.3 times more in 2013—an even more impressive feat given that Chinese manufacturing wages are significantly lower, which reduces the ROI of robotics installation—suggests strong competitive advantage. [215] Fifth, the authors finally got to the real measures of power when they looked at OECD’s value-added output in various industries. The problem is that they considered only high-tech industries as important—not motor vehicles, where tank production is classified; or shipbuilding, where aircraft carriers are classified; not steel, which weapons systems use; etc. And even more, they included telecommunications services and professional services sectors that have no bearing on national power and leverage. If the Chinese were to cut off all exports to us, we’d still have these two perfectly functioning sectors, because they are not traded, they are domestic. When looking at traded high-tech sectors, as the authors defined them, the OECD data shows that in 2022 (they used 2020 data), the U.S. share was 29.5 percent, with China’s 18.5 percent, a significant U.S. lead. [216] But leaving out the two nontraded sectors, and the nongoods sector of IT and information services, China’s share jumps to 27.7% while the U.S. share falls to 20.7 percent. [217] Moreover, a core mistake the authors made is that they presented a static snapshot of China. They were absolutely correct that in certain sectors such as aerospace, drugs, semiconductors, and equipment that China lags behind the United States. And that does give the United States some breathing room. But in all these industries and more, China’s progress is rapid. For example, from 2016 to 2022, China’s output in other transportation, which includes aerospace, increased four times faster than U.S. value-added output, while its computer and semiconductor output increase twice as fast. And while the United States government is cutting federal R&D, the Chinese government is expanding it. They also argued that Chinese GDP is exaggerated in official CCP figures. This may very well be the case, but it is not the key point if one is considering the global war for advanced industries. If China’s personal services, retail, and legal services market is not expanding, that means lower GDP, but it has no effect on national power industries. Sixth, the book goes all out to make its case. Case in point, the authors reported that because of the U.S. export sanctions, Huawei’s global phone share fell from 11 percent in 2000 to 3.5 percent in 2024. They were either not aware of, or ignored the fact, that about 4 percentage points of that drop was due to Huawei spinning off its lower-end phone business to a new company, Honor. And they overlooked that Huawei is not the world’s largest telecom equipment manufacturer, and its global market share for telecom equipment increased from 29 percent in early 2018 to 31 percent by 2024. [218] Finally, the authors pointed to the fact that the United Staes has used export controls to supposedly hobble China (which they did not in the case of Huawei) while China has refrained from trying to do the same to the United States as evidence that it is weaker technologically and has little leverage. Because of this, the authors amazingly argued for even more export controls against China to weaken it. This betrays a fundamental reading of China. China has no interest in cutting off sales of its products to the United States, because unlike the USG, it realizes that more Chinese sales strengthen its companies and weaken America’s. Moreover, China still benefits from U.S. investment in China, and the technology transfer it gets. It doesn’t close its markets to foreign investment until the industry in question is dominant. It is biding its time to gain even more from foreign firms. Chamberlain probably rightly believed that there was little that France and the United Kingdom could do to deter or weaken Hitler, so he engaged in appeasement. Today, that is a common strategy toward China proposed by many in the foreign policy establishment. The 2019 Open Letter advocates this: “U.S. opposition will not prevent the continued expansion of the Chinese economy, a greater global market share for Chinese companies and an increase in China’s role in world affairs.” [219] On what basis do they make this assertion, other than they value engagement above all else? Why wouldn’t a strategy of limiting Chinese exports and working with our allies to do the same result in China having less global market share instead of more? However, for them, even if we could do something to limit China’s rise, we shouldn’t because it would hurt ourselves. The authors went on to write that “the United States cannot significantly slow China’s rise without damaging itself.” [220] China scholar Susan Shirk agreed, stating that “there is no objective measure to suggest that a dramatic reduction in the extent or quality of China’s participation in global commerce and finance would do anything except harm economic growth in the United States.” [221] A Brookings report in 2022 expressed the same sentiment that the fight will be costly, so it will hurt us. It states that: Fully extracting Chinese firms from Department of Defense supply chains, including those that produce rare earth minerals for example, would likely be infeasible, and may discourage innovation by imposing costs that would likely be insurmountable for start-up companies. [222] It goes on the criticize the idea that the United States should produce more key goods that we compete for with China, presumably because it would entail the dreaded “industrial policy” and because it would cost money: While it is reasonable to geographically diversify this particular portfolio, the imperative should not be applied more broadly to the high-tech industry overall. The goal of subsidies, tax breaks, and loan guarantee programs should be to incentivize greater supply chain resilience in sectors that are vital for the provision of necessary public goods; it should not be to strengthen the balance sheet of domestic firms or increase domestic production of high-tech goods and services per se. [223] And above all, the authors worry that tariffs “increase the costs of goods for consumers.” [224] Why not eliminate the U.S. defense budget because it raises costs for taxpayers? We would be much better off spending money on consumer goods than defense goods if we didn’t have to worry about national defense. And besides, this broad assertion of self-damage, made with no real logic, is certainly true with some actions, but not with others. Limiting the imports of national power industry goods or services produced unfairly helps, not hurts the United States. After WWII, the entire U.S. defense and foreign policy establishment focused on Europe, largely ignoring Asia. The belief was that if Stalin attacked, he would go West, not Southeast. But Stalin, and Mao, had other ideas, giving the green light to North Korea’s Marxist-Leninist dictator Kim Il-Sung to invade South Korea. The analogy to today is the notion of derisking: a denial of the China threat and capabilities. Popular in the EU—which abhors having to take a stand against China and can’t dare to consider that the old vision of globalization (a world where no nation other than America needs to spend money on defense) is dead, and wants to sell as much to China as it can—the idea is that it’s only a few industries that we have to fight for to “derisk” from China. [225] In a recent EU report on derisking, the EU Parliament wrote: According to Ursula von der Leyen, de-risking is not exclusively vis-à-vis China, as it is about ‘managing the risks we see, addressing excessive dependencies through diversification of our supply chains. This is a positive communication move, as it has the potential to be better perceived in China than the triptych (China as a cooperation partner-economic competitor, systemic rival. [226] Jake Sullivan also supported this strategy when he proposed, “De-risking and diversifying, not decoupling.” [227] In other words, the EU above all does not want to make the CCP mad by calling it a systematic rival. The term derisking allows, the EU believes, the limiting of some dependencies on China while not making it so angry that it limits EU sales to China, something the EU puts at the top of its agenda with China. The EU report goes on to state, “Trade and openness are deeply engrained within the European project, and the more moderate de-risking concept is meant as a way to find a better equilibrium between seizing opportunities and managing risks.” [228] The EU above all does not want to make the CCP mad by calling it a systematic rival. The term derisking allows, the EU believes, the limiting of some dependencies on China while not making it so angry that it limits EU sales to China, something the EU puts at the top of its agenda with China. “Seizing opportunities” is a euphemism for selling more to China, especially if it comes at the expense of U.S. exports, while welcoming Chinese factories to be built in the EU. [229] The report goes on to narrow the scope for derisking, even embracing more dependency on China: In many fields, European firms also look to the Chinese market and Chinese partners not only for research and development opportunities, but also as a source of technology. Ultimately, the de-risking approach proposed by the Commission may be considered one of risk mitigation or management, rather than a cleansing exercise. Indeed, many companies, Member States and even the Commission seek generally to maintain avenues of economic and technological cooperation, ensuring that China remains a partner for Europe in areas that do not constitute a palpable risk for Europe’s security. [230] The EU also defines derisking not as only with China, but amazingly also with the United States: “De-risking is strongly tied to the EU Economic Security Strategy that goes beyond China.” [231] And the EU seeks to derisk from the United States, as the recent “Draghi report” suggests. [232] When it talks about strategic dependencies in the IT hardware sector, it talks more about the United States than it does about China. In the fact, the report is only partially focused on China, with much of the discussion on the United States’ techno-economic capabilities. Finally, there are a range of strategic approaches that largely ignore either attacking Chinese capabilities or defending against its techno-economic aggression, and instead focus only on ways the United States can improve. France relied on defense against Hitler. It failed. A similar approach is in vogue in the United States today. In a report for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Jon Bateman argued that “the primary effort should be ‘offensive’: new investments and incentives to bolster and diversify innovation pathways, supply chains, talent pipelines, and revenue models in strategic technology areas.” [233] In a 2018 article in Foreign Affairs , Kurt Campbell and Ely Ratner, former members of the Biden administration. argued: The starting point for a better approach is a new degree of humility about the United States’ ability to change China. Neither seeking to isolate and weaken it nor trying to transform it for the better should be the lodestar of U.S. strategy in Asia. Washington should instead focus more on its own power and behavior, and the power and behavior of its allies and partners. [234] Even if the United States had the political will to come together to fight the war and the willingness to commit the significant resources to spur domestic competitiveness, that would still not be enough. A Biden interim national security guideline issued in March 2021 echoes this: “[O]ur enduring advantages will allow us to prevail in strategic competition with China or any other nation.” [235] It went on to note, “The most effective way for America to out-compete a more assertive and authoritarian China over the long-term is to invest in our people, our economy, and our democracy.” [236] Even if the United States had the political will to come together to fight the war and the willingness to commit the significant resources to boost domestic competitiveness, that would still not be enough. The CCP’s pockets and tools will always be deeper and sharper than America’s. In the U.S. Civil War, General McLellan let Robert E. Lee intimidate him and set the stage for where to fight. McLelland reacted and retreated. But Ulysses S. Grant did not, famously stating, “I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.” [237] McLellan’s thinking is what passes for much of U.S. competitiveness and tech policy thinking today. Well, we can’t compete with China in “x” (e.g., drones, telecom equipment, chemicals, and even manufacturing generally), so we will retreat to higher ground of “x.” Usually, “x” is AI. Well, China is good at manufacturing, but we are good at AI, so we can let them have manufacturing; we will win in AI. Some justify this by hyping AI as the secret weapon in the techno-economic war—akin to Hitler’s jet fighters and V-2 rockets. Once the United States gets to artificial general intelligence (AGI) or even artificial superintelligence (ASI), the war is over, and the United States has won. AGI will give us utmost power to outcompete China everywhere. As one study puts it: The contest between China and the United States to harness the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) has become this generation’s defining technological rivalry. The report concludes that America’s ability to shape AI’s trajectory depends on extending its technological advantage over China as much as possible. Rather than focusing on unlikely cooperation, the United States must pursue decisive technical superiority fueled by a vision for American AI that advances democratic values and global development. Effectively managing the fraught issues on AI’s horizon can strengthen the United States’ soft power and technological advantage; failing to do so risks derailing American AI progress and ceding ground to Beijing. [238] It is a seductive notion, but likely as wrong as Hitler’s betting the war on Wunderwaffen (wonder weapons) rather than more tanks. First, China is making rapid progress in AI. It’s not like the 1990s with “Wintelism” (Windows and Intel) and U.S. dominance in personal computing and then the Internet. China is in the game. Second, it is a bet-the-farm risk that AI is the superweapon of the techno-economic war. What if AI is just another normal, albeit important technology? A technology that improves production in many sectors, but does not transform the world like never before. In that case, AI will not be able to preserve our national power industries such as drugs, aerospace, chips, machine tools, chemicals, etc. That, rather than sci-fi stories about ASI is the much more likely outcome, at least in the next quarter century when this conflict really matters. A related story is that it’s not just AI, but rather a host of emerging technologies that will save us. Through the magic of Silicon Valley, America will lead in the industries of the future: blockchain, humanoid robots, quantum, synthetic biology, 3D printing, and of course AI. Biden’s Secretary of State Antony Blinken agreed, identifying six technologies as core to the U.S. competitive strategy: “microelectronics, advanced computing and quantum technologies, artificial intelligence, biotechnology and biomanufacturing, advanced telecommunications, and clean energy technologies.” [239] (Although the administration never bothered to explain why clean energy is strategic when we have lots of dirty energy.) It seems like advocates of this view get their understanding of technology from Wired Magazine , focused on the cool, cutting-edge stuff, much of what they experience in their own lives. No need to fight to win the silicon chip wars; just develop the next generation of processors such as neuromorphic computing and the like. [240] No need to win the compute wars; just jump ahead to quantum. Don’t worry about the chemical sector; embrace “synthetic biology.” [241] And don’t forget, we have Silicon Valley; we can afford to cede the rest of the territory as long as we have the commanding heights of the Valley. This wrongly implies that atom-based industries—or “deep tech”—such as aerospace, vehicles, machine tools, and chemicals are not strategic. Moreover, for all the wonder of Silicon Valley, it’s just not that big, accounting for just 1.5 percent of U.S. GDP. [242] The problems with this approach are similar to those of AI. First, capacity in breakthrough technologies often comes from leadership in prior technologies. Biotech breakthroughs depend on strong, large U.S. biopharmaceutical companies. 6G might come from startups, but more likely it will come from incumbents such as Qualcomm and Ericsson. Quantum could come from new entrants, but existing IT and computer companies are more likely to develop it. Second, the United States has a long history of leading in innovative breakthroughs only to lose production to other nations. Why would this time be any different if the fundamental U.S. strategy and policy remain the same? In fact, with China poised to hoover up U.S. breakthrough knowledge and commercialize it in China, one would expect even more of the same pattern. China is fighting hard in all of them, and some of these industries have a very similar dynamic to ones that the United States has already lost to China. The United States has a long history of leading in innovative breakthroughs only to lose production to other nations. Why would this time be any different if the fundamental U.S. strategy and policy remain the same? Third, there is no reason to expect that the United States will win all these sectors, especially with the deep cuts in federal funding for research. It was much easier for the United States to win past tech breakthroughs when the federal government funded such a massive amount of research. It no longer does. Finally, there are many sectors, such as machine tools, basic chemicals, and others that are strategic but not cutting-edge, cool, high-tech. These and others are less likely to experience breakthrough innovations that could launch new companies in the United States. Another strategy, related to the AI and emerging technologies ones, is to rely on some kind of vague, promised scientific innovations. Presumably, this pays off in commercial success in the United States and in strategic industries and technologies. In a report for CSIS, Rand’s Mike Mazzar wrote, “The domestic foundation for success in turn has three major components: nurturing a supportive ecosystem for science and technology, promoting diffusion, and managing the wider social effects of technology for competitive advantage.” [243] His first component for U.S. success is, “The domestic U.S. foundations of scientific and technological innovation, including the supporting science and technology ecosystem, must remain at a world-class level.” [244] This is a widely held view that a better science system will go a long way toward saving us. In a 2022 speech, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan stated, “Advancements in science and technology are poised to define the geopolitical landscape of the 21st century. They will generate game-changers in health and medicine, food security, and clean energy. We’ll see leap-ahead breakthroughs and new industries that drive our prosperity.” [245] In his otherwise excellent book, David Shambaugh reflected this conventional wisdom when he wrote, “We also need to invest considerable sums into basic scientific research in order to maintain all American comparative advantage in innovation.” [246] This is an appealing and safe framing because it doesn’t require a dreaded strategic industry strategy that involves picking winners. It doesn’t even involve the painful task of telling U.S. scientists that they have to do more work related to the national interest. Rather, it’s grounded in the more widely accepted view that government can play the key role in innovation by funding scientific research that U.S. scientists choose to focus on. But it also reflects a shallow and misguided view of how innovation takes place and even what it is. Innovation is not scientific discovery, something that is now available widely around the globe. Innovation is the successful bringing to the market of a new product, process, or service, and beating the competition while doing it. Innovation doesn’t come from STEM workers or science funding. It comes from organizations with embedded knowledge. That requires a deep understanding of organizational production and corporate strategy. And sophisticated organizations anywhere on the planet can absorb a significant portion of the science breakthroughs funded by the USG. Exactly how does the U.S. military fight wars with the best lawyers, consultants, accountants, and universities? The ultimate retreat is to say that no particular part of land is strategic enough to defend. This is the view of the “potato chips, computers chips, what’s the difference?” group. In this view, all industries are the same. Who cares if America manufactures anything; it’s dirty and dull anyway? We will take the commanding heights of global finance, business consulting, content, and higher education. A report from CSIS summarizes the view: “What is missing from both strategies for competing with China is a focus on what is too often the unsung driver of U.S. competitiveness: services.” [247] Exactly how does the U.S. military fight wars with the best lawyers, consultants, accountants, and universities? But these are soothing visions. No need to fight. You walk away from the aggressor. You do better things than the aggressor. Still another distraction from the war is the view by elites, especially global business elites and fellow travelers in the academic and punditry, which is that the problem is with the West and that only a new kind of capitalism will save it. Besides implying a self-loathing of Western capitalism, this view is a major distraction from the task at hand of not letting the West lose in national power industry war. One example is the famous (or infamous) Trilateral Commission, whose “Task Force on Global Capitalism in Transition” argued that it is Western capitalism that is inherently problematic, something that is remarkably similar to what Xi Jinping says. [248] The Task Force has argued, “There are growing concerns about whether market-based economies will be able to adequately address climate change, the disruptions triggered by the digital revolution, and rising inequalities. Moving toward a more sustainable and inclusive capitalism is thus a defining challenge of our age.” [249] In other words, climate and inequality demand a new kind of capitalism. Maybe even capitalism with Chinese characteristics? In fact, the Task Force has lauded the CCP’s efforts as fellow reform travelers: “Even China—the largest beneficiary of global capitalism over the past 40 years—launched a campaign in 2021 to curb ‘the disorderly expansion of capital.’” [250] It appears that they did not know that the disorder the CCP was trying to put in order was from companies not investing in ensuring Chinese global dominance in national power industries. The Task Force has even stated that the Chinese economy arguably meets the criteria for a capitalist system. Hence, China is in the club with America seeking “the transition in global capitalism” to a happy, clean, more equal sixth phase. And of course, the World Economic Forum (WEF) is at the forefront of this kind of self-flagellation. Former director Klaus Schwab recently stated, “We now have a window of opportunity to create this Global Reset which we all need. This Global Reset is necessary because we have seen how our policies which we pursued before the coronavirus struck us because those policies do not create the necessary inclusion of society necessary for harmonious societal development.” [251] Was he not aware that the term “harmonious societal development” is a CCP global talking point to attack the Western model of development? [252] It’s worth adding that this was from a person who told a Chinese forum, “We are coming out, thanks also to the leadership of China in terms of fighting the pandemic.” [253] And he was “happy to see China putting high priorities on developing its ‘fourth industrial revolution’ capabilities.” [254] Sounding like China Daily, WEF touts that China is “driving global growth,” “reshaping food systems,” and powering a “remarkable green transition.” It is even helping the world with its rare earth minerals policies. WEF sees China as no different than any other nation, except it’s bigger, provides more benefits, and is more committed to free trade than America is. One WEF article about China at Davos 2025 states, “China showcased its transition from traditional growth drivers to a new model centered on domestic consumption, advanced manufacturing, and green transformation, while emphasizing continued commitment to opening up amid geopolitical tensions.” [255] Yes, that would be the “new” model on domestic consumption the CCP has been promising without delivering for the last 15 years. Yes, if you consider green transition to be China’ coal-fired power plant construction hitting a 10-year high. [256] And yes, if it’s possible to commit to opening up while simultaneously shutting out more and more foreign companies from its markets. And the writer went on to castigate America for being closed: The recent US Department of Defense designation of CATL as a “Chinese military company” highlighted the challenges ahead for Chinese companies operating globally. While Chinese officials and business leaders consistently emphasized openness and collaboration, there was clear recognition of the need to navigate an increasingly complex international environment. [257] Sounding like China Daily, WEF touts that China is “driving global growth,” “reshaping food systems,” and powering a “remarkable green transition.” It is even helping the world with its rare earth minerals policies. [258] (True, if helping means putting the rest of the world’s rare earth miners and processors out of business.) And the author, a professor educated in China and now teaching in Australia, has argued, “A more balanced narrative is the first step towards a coherent, globally coordinated policy response.” [259] That is CCP speak for, “Stop criticizing us.” The pacifist Quincy Institute agrees, blaming capitalism for U.S.-China competition: The United States and China are trapped in zero-sum economic competition today because neoliberal globalization consistently failed to create the broad growth that would allow prosperity in all countries… The U.S. and China are thus locked in a zero-sum struggle that is distracting both sides from the root causes of the conflict and strengthening the forces of authoritarianism and nationalism in both countries. [260] Ahh, if only the United States abandoned “neoliberalism,” the CCP could get back to what it really wants to do: boost the Chinese proletariat. In WWII, Krupp was the major defense contractor in Germany, and Hitler relied on it for building superweapons to win the war. Today, there is a similar myopic focus of just reforming defense procurement in order to address the China threat. U.S. industrial policy for defense goods was seen as necessary because markets would fail. But an industrial policy for dual-use and enabling industries? That’s a whole other matter. Much of the discussion of national power industry competition with China focuses narrowly on the defense industrial base and the myriad of reforms offered to improve it. These range from more competition, more procurement from the civilian sector, multi-year procurement, more foreign military sales, more allied cooperation and specialization, and of course, more flexible contracting and funding mechanisms. [261] It’s not that these proposals are not useful, they very well may be. But the belief that we cannot lose the power industry war with China by only improving how DOD spends its procurement and R&D budgets is wishful thinking. In the first half of the 20th century, the Swiss had a great strategy: let the rest of Europe destroy itself by making sure that the costs of invading mountainous Switzerland were very high and that Switzerland would stay neutral. The problem with this strategy was that it could have let either the Nazis or the Soviets control Europe. But still, the redoubt strategy is attractive and seductive. Many neo-protectionist Republicans want to erect high mountains from tariffs and therefore couldn’t care less about what other nations, including China, do. Tariffs will ensure that the American economy will be self-sufficient and that China can do it little harm, at least economically. In this view, while a country such as Canada or the United Kingdom couldn’t do that because their GDP is too small, the U.S. market is big enough to let every industry comfortably produce and thrive, as long as they are protected by high enough tariff walls. The problems with this strategy are many. Most importantly, it ensures that China wins the global war. It may not “occupy our land” (e.g., hollow out our strategic industries), but it is likely to occupy the rest of the world. The United States would find itself living in a world where our influence would be minimal: no country would want to risk alienating the hegemon of Beijing. Just look at Europe now, tiptoeing around in fear of aggravating the CCP (or India, going to Beijing to get closer). Imagine how obsequious Europe would be without the United States to protect it. A protectionist redoubt is a prescription for U.S. national power industry decline. Second, most strategic industries that are technologically advanced, such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, aerospace, fine chemicals, and more, require global market share to survive. The fixed cost is too high to hope to recover them in a market even as large as the United States’. A protectionist redoubt is a prescription for U.S. national power industry decline. Just as in World WWII and the Cold War with the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc, the only effective strategy is to stand and fight collectively. We have to take a stand. Like General Grant in the battle of the Wilderness: no more retreat. not one step back, only attacking the next day. Or like in World War II, when the Nazis were relentless in their advance and the Soviets had their backs to the wall, Stalin issued his famous not one step back order. While it meant hundreds of thousands of Soviet military deaths, it also meant that the back of the Wehrmacht would be broken. Accepting that this is the only acceptable high-level strategy means a fundamental reexamination and reformulation of past institutional arrangements and policies. This means disruption and rethinking past assumptions about globalization, financial capitalism, the role of government, and the regulatory state. And it means embracing the development and implementation of a strategy to not lose the war. In this sense, the Kennan concept of containment is the right one. Kennan understood the threat to the West from Soviet communist expansionism. And he knew that the ability of the West to defeat the Soviets, especially militarily, was minimal—at least until the Soviet Union began to fall significantly far behind the United States as they started doing in the 1970s. As such, the strategy was to limit the ability of the Soviet bloc to develop (through export controls and limited trade) while limiting its ability to expand into allied nations, and finally working to gain the hearts and minds of the unaligned world. Today, the United States does not have the capability to defeat China from a techno-economic perspective. We might have been 20 years ago, when the techno-economic capabilities ratio was much more in our favor, but it no longer is. While various export controls and other means might throw a wrench into Chinese progress (delaying them and raising costs), there is no evidence or reason to believe that it can keep the CCP from its ultimate goal of techno-economic domination. The goal has to be, first and foremost, not letting the CCP win the battles for strategic industries in allied nations. The reason is simple: more sales for its strategic industry firms means more innovation and lower costs for China. Fewer sales for our strategic industry firms mean less innovation and higher costs for us. An overarching strategy for how to do that is laid out ahead, but for now, suffice to say it involves offense (supporting domestic companies in their battles) and defense (limiting Chinese companies’ access to our markets). Unless the United States rejects both free-market-based consumer welfare economics and progressive, quasi-socialist worker economics and instead adopts a national power economics doctrine and framework, it will lose the war. Taking this seriously and to heart has major implications for the nation. First, it means that we have to give less attention to many of the political hot-button issues that the Right and the Left are willing to go the ramparts for. And it means, just as in the Cold War, that the American people and our leaders need to admit and bear the very serious costs that engaging in this war will cost. JFK said that “ we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.” [262] Few Americans likely believe that today; in fact, many are ambivalent about the very value of liberty. As such, setting that as the core strategy is paramount. But unless the United States rejects both free-market-based consumer welfare economics and progressive, quasi-socialist worker economics and instead adopts a national power economics doctrine and framework, it will lose the war. Two economic doctrines compete for U.S. dominance: free-market, consumer welfare economics and neo-New Deal worker-oriented progressivism. Most economic policy, including trade, technology, tax and budget, and regulatory policy is grounded in the discipline of economics. In America’s case, this is neo-classical economics. Another term for it is consumer welfare-focused economics because the goal is maximizing consumer welfare, ideally by allowing the free reign of market forces enabling the efficient allocation of resources. In this frame, policies are usually judged by their effects on consumers and free markets. The free trade, free-market think tank The Peterson Institute reflects that view when it argued that: the United States cannot and should not have as its policy goal greater self-sufficiency across a wide range of activities. The nation—and the manufacturing sector in particular—is too deeply engaged in international trade to make that advisable. Furthermore, the efficiency gains from this diversification of supply are substantial. [263] And in this view, efficiency is maximized when prices are set by natural supply and demand forces in markets. A minimum wage: bad because it substitutes government dictate for market forces and hurts consumers. Tariffs: bad because they substitute government dictate for market forces and hurt consumers. Industry subsidies: bad because they substitute government dictate for market forces and hurt consumers in their role as taxpayers. Company market power: bad because it gives them the ability to limit supply or raise prices in ways that true free markets would not. In conventional economics, consumption is paramount. Trade deficits are actually good because they enable more consumption. No industry is more important than any other because consumer spending determines which industries are important. And foreign subsidization of export industries are good for the United States because they lead to lower prices. If these countries are dumb enough to give us “discounts” on their exports, we’d be dumb to say no. As such, this doctrine sees limiting Chinese auto imports to the United States as bad economic policy because consumers lose. Ignore the fact that much of China’s cost advantage comes from government subsidies and a suppressed currency and that open imports would likely significantly harm U.S. auto producers. And because companies make profits by most efficiently serving consumer needs, strong profits are a reflection of a strong economy. In this theory, the fact that U.S. firms are vastly more profitable than Chinese firms means not only that the U.S. system is better than the Chinese system, but also that the United States is stronger. Indeed, the United States has evolved into a society where it seems that stock prices are the paramount concern. Stocks up, economy strong. Stocks down, economy weak. A Council of Foreign Relations article on China reflects this consensus consumer welfare view: U.S. trade with China has grown enormously in recent decades and is crucial for both countries. Today, China is one of the largest export markets for U.S. goods and services (second to Mexico), and the United States is the top export market for China. This trade—much of which grew after China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001—has brought lower prices to U.S. consumers and higher profits for U.S. corporations. [264] Andy Rothman, an American financial advisor in China, argued: C hina drives global economic growth, so a sound bilateral relationship is important to American consumers and workers, as well as to families who are counting on stock market returns to pay for their retirement. In the 10 years through 2019, China, on average, accounted for about one third of global economic growth. [265] By definition, national power is an externality. From a consumer-welfare perspective, defense spending is a waste—as are, for the conventional economists, national power industry policies. In this system, if U.S. companies offshore manufacturing or exit from manufacturing altogether, this is optimal, for two reasons. First, by definition, whatever market forces lead to is optimal, as it reflects the most efficient allocation of resources. Second, offshoring must lead to higher profits for firms exiting low-margin industries or business segments. And as we have seen, higher profits are seen as synonymous with a strong economy. If investing in software and information services firms generated higher profits than investing in factories did, then it is American firms that are the smart ones and the American economy that is the strong one. Box 4: Adam Smith: Wrong and Misinterpreted It’s striking that few people seem to think it strange that the core economic thinkers for both today’s Left and Right—Karl Marx and Adam Smith, respectively—put pen to paper more than 150 years ago. Maybe antiquity is why their works are treated as scripture. But Marx is far worse than Smith, in retrospect. Most of what he wrote is completely wrong, including his claim that capitalism repeals the laws of competition such that all the fruits of technological progress go to the capitalists. [266] And of course, his followers were responsible for unspeakable crimes against humanity. While Adam Smith is not as wrong as Marx was, at times, it’s a close call. Why does this matter? Because the principle intellectual grounding today, at least among the Right and Center, in America against a national power industry strategy finds it succor in Smith’s 1976 Wealth of Nations. Smith’s famous line, “By pursuing his own interest [an individual] frequently promotes that of society the more effectually than when he really intends to promote it,” has morphed into biblical certainty. [267] To be sure, the pursuit of individual profit can and often does lead to societal benefit. But this is such a simplistic framing, it’s blatant in its obviousness. What about the cases where self-interest is not enough? This gets to Smith’s core error: his disregard of production externalities. Economists define an externalitiy as a side effect or consequence of an industrial or commercial activity that affects other parties without being reflected in the cost of the goods or services involved. If these are minimal, than a Smithian world does produce optimally. But even in Smith’s time, they were not minimal—and in a world driven by advanced tehcnology, they are even more ubiquitous and important. The reality is that the success of any one venture depends on the success of many others, both public and private. If an individual in Smith’s time wanted to open a pin-making factory, he would have had a hard time if there had had also not been companies making steel and tools to cut the steel. In other words, success of companies depends in part not just on entrepreneurial will and vigor, especially in technologically complex industries, but also on the overall industrial ecosystem. And because companies are indifferent to externalities, by definition—they are external to the firm—relying on firms alone can lead to underperformance. Markets seldom solve externalities on their own. Governments do though. Smtih was also wrong when it came to domestic vs. foreign production. While Smith was accurately describing his times, he did not worry about the negative effect of offshoring production because doing so was quite difficult. Indeed, he wrote that “every individual endeavors to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry.” [268] But what happens to his laissez-faire model if moving production to Shanghai is as easy as moving it to Sheffield? In other cases, Smith qualified his statements with important caveats, but these are largely ignored by die-hard free-market, consumer-welfare economists. Even before David Ricardo, Smith argued that it made no sense to produce something domestically when it could be purchased more cheaply from abroad. This obvious insight is treated as Nobel Prize-winning genius and used to inform all of U.S. trade policy. Sure, it makes no sense for the United States to grow coffee, but what about other things such as cars and semiconductors? It seems as if free-market Smithians never bothered to read: “There seem, however, to be two cases, in which it will generally be advantage to lay some burden upon foreign, for the encouragement of domestic industry.” [269] In other words, Smith did not rule out government action for trade competitiveness, and in fact, downright encouraged it. The first is for defense industry. He wrote, “The first is when some particular sort of industry is necessary for the defense of the country.” Given the criticality of the British navy at the time, he used the case of shipbuilding. If he had been writing in the 1920s, he would have mentioned airplanes. As Barnett Corelli wrote regarding The Wealth of Nations , “This vital distinction was totally lost by nineteenth-century apostles of Free Trade.” [270] And, it could be added, by 21st century apostles of free trade in the United States. For Smithians, free markets and free trade, by definition, maximize what Smith termed “opulence.” Smith went on to note a second key caveat to free markets and trade: The second case, in which it will generally be advantageous to lay some burden upon foreign countries for the encouragement of domestic industry, is when some tax is imposed at home upon the produce of the latter. In this case, it seems reasonable that an equal tax should be imposed on the like produce of the former. [271] He wrote that when a foreign nation limits imports of goods, the home nation has an advantage if the other nation should impose some “duties or prohibitions upon the importation of some or all of their manufacturers into ours.” [272] But to be fair, he only proposed that as a tactic to get the foreign nation to reduce its distortions. If they would not, then the home nation should do nothing. Except if the industry were important to national defense. This all gets to the fundamental flaw of Adam Smith’s doctrine, which Barnett rightly calls “(classical) liberalism.” In his book The Decline of British Power , he wrote, “This swift decline in British vigor at home and the failure to exploit the empire were not owing to some inevitable senescent process of history. They shared a specific cause. That cause was political doctrine; a doctrine blindly believed in long after it had ceased to correspond with reality.” [273] He went on to say: The doctrine was liberalism, which criticized and finally demolished the traditional conception of the nation-state as a collective organism, a community; and asserted the primacy of the individual. According to liberal thinking, a nation was no more than so many human atoms who happened to live under the same set of laws. From such belief it followed that the State, instead of being the embodiment of a national community as it had been under the Tudors and the Commonwealth, was required to dwindle into a kind of policeman, standing apart from the national life, and with the merely negative task of keeping the free-for-all of individual competition with the bounds of decorum. [274] He noted that as Adam Smith brought this doctrine to the fore, when it came to the national production system, the doctrine held, “What was socially necessary could be safely untrusted to spontaneous creation by private initiative.” [275] The problem then for Britain was when advanced economies evolved from small production shops with limited technological sophistication to mass production factories of increasing scientific and technological sophistication, Britain was completely unprepared. As Barnett wrote, “The English therefore entered the industrial era—the era of organization—with a deep-seated horror or organization, the larger the organization the greater the horror.” [276] Spoken as a true neo-Brandeisian of the Left or Right would today. We see that in the United States after the rise of traditional liberalism and libertarian, free-market economics in the 1970s. Free-market scholars such as Oliver Williamson dealt with the horror of organization by simply assuming it away, seeing large corporations merely as a way to reduce transaction costs among self-interested individuals. [277] As a result, with the exception of wartime, the role of the British state was limited to writing reports about how backward British business was and how that threatened national security. As Barnett wrote, “To suggest in Britain in the late nineteenth century that the government should guide the industrial and commercial life of the nation was like suggesting medical treatment to a Jehovah’s Witness.” [278] This was a doctrinal spell that was cast over the British leaders. Again, Barnett: “Like an enchantment, liberal doctrine seemed to blind British eyes and paralysis British willpower.” [279] This was, to say the least, a crisis of utmost proportions as Germany, Japan, and the United States were racing ahead, all three with at least some, if not strong, support from government. [280] Barnett continued, “Thus after 1870 liberal economic doctrine itself was the most catastrophically inappropriate of all the outdated components of British economic development.” [281] And as it became clearer and clearer on just how far Britain was falling behind, even as many continued to keep their head in the sands of denial (as in the United States today), he wrote, “No evidence of foreign success therefore shook the general British faith in British industry.” [282] While the parallels of British history then are certainly not exact with the American situation today, there are striking similarities. Liberalism dominates U.S. political economy thinking, and with it the belief that no industry is more important than others, that trade is largely welfare-maximizing, and that state policy is not needed, other than in the form of limited regulations and taxes and perhaps science spending and immigration, to ensure national power industry capabilities. To use Smith’s terms, it is time to give more priority to “power” and less to “opulence.” There are two key problems with this conceptualization that consumer and investor welfare is synonymous with national welfare. First, this might be true, or at least truer, if we were talking about net-present value welfare. But all too often stock prices go up when companies take steps that weaken their long-term position but strengthen their quarterly or yearly financials. When CEO Mark Hurd was cutting Hewlett Packard’s long-term investments, including in R&D, he helped drive HP stock prices through the roof. Yet, the real net present value of the firm was declining, as was made clear when this “rob the future to pay the present” strategy was made clear to shareholders. Second, even consumer-welfare economists recognize the existence of externalities wherein the costs or benefits from an individual actor’s decision (including a firm) are not the same as the costs or benefits to society. But despite their incorporation of externalities in economic theory, for the most part, they ignore them, especially when advising on policy. Their view is that externalities are too messy, too uncertain, and too open to manipulation by politics. Let’s pretend they don’t exist, and that market forces alone produce optimality. But, by definition, national power is an externality. From a consumer-welfare perspective, defense spending is a complete waste—as are, for the conventional economists, national power industry policies. But clearly defending the nation from aggression is an important benefit, even if individual consumers or firms taxed to pay for it don’t benefit. At the end of the day, national power industries have much in common with pure defense industries, and their strength provides important national benefits. It is inappropriate to blame conventional economists for the paucity of their theory and concepts. Consumer welfare economics is what it is, and it certainly has its uses. But its uses are close to zero when it comes to shaping and guiding national industry power strategy. Where mainstream economists deserve blame is veering from their lane to negatively pontificate against a national power industry strategy. They should stick to their knitting: issues such as interest rates, the problems with housing price controls, and the like. Leave national power industry strategy to the experts. Consumer welfare economics is what it is, and it certainly has its uses. But its uses are close to zero when it comes to shaping and guiding national industry power strategy. This means that conventional economics as practiced in the United States and Commonwealth nations, and to somewhat lesser extent in Europe, can no longer by the lodestar guide shaping national economic policy. It was not designed to operate in a national power trade world, and it was not designed to generate national power industry strength. As such, it is now fundamentally harmful to the nation, and if it continues to be the policy bible, it will lead to the decline of the United States. The reality of this techno-economic and trade attack fundamentally undercuts the foundation of consumer welfare economics, and exposes its inability to address the current challenge. If national power, not consumer welfare, is the ultimate goal, this doctrine fails, at least for guiding the share of the economy composed of national economic power industries. If a nation’s industrial mix is critical, then this doctrine of “potato chips, computer chips, what’s the difference?” fails. While there has been growing criticism of consumer welfare economics—what its critics call “neoliberalism”—the replacement that most on the Left have adopted is no better in dealing with the China threat; in fact, it is likely worse. A broad-strokes consensus has gelled around the contours of a neo-New Deal economic agenda marked by redistribution, global economic autarky, and worker-centric animus toward large corporations and markets. If implemented, neo-New Dealism might generate a one-time reduction in inequality, but it would come at the longer-term cost of economic stagnation, fiscal crisis, and greatly diminished U.S. national power industry capabilities. In its worst form, neo-New Dealism would severely erode the meritocratic, individualist capitalist system as America has known it. Progressive journalist Michael Tomasky perhaps defined neo-New Dealism best. He calls it “middle-out economics” which “is the belief that prosperity comes from a thriving middle class, and therefore government plays a role in supporting families and communities. This version of capitalism—more just, more equal, and in which prosperity is shared—could be the American future.” [283] Many of those who have turned toward neo-New Dealism hold a deep skepticism toward corporations, markets, and American global power. Proponents of neo-New Dealism, a faction that now includes much more than just the Bernie Sanders and “Squad” wing of the Democratic Party, insist that they are just providing a needed alternative to neoliberalism, filling a gap that needed filling. But with its animus toward large companies; its deep suspicion of markets, globalization, and capitalism; its focus on short-term worker welfare; and its overriding goal of redistributing rather than growing the pie, neo-New Dealism would mean losing the national power industry war with China. Sadly, some Republicans have begun to embrace some of these progressive views, especially the animus toward large corporations, the focus on redistribution, and their putting worker interests ahead of national interests, especially related to automation and technology. Neo-New Dealism is about redistribution that ignores, and often rejects, growth (e.g., it’s bad for the planet, it only helps the rich get richer, it creates too much disruption, etc.). Its “middle out” agenda—including eliminating college debt; free health care, elder care, college tuition, and childcare; weakened IP protection; drug price controls; mandates on companies, such as forcing Internet service providers (ISPs) to sell broadband at a loss; breaking up big companies and limiting productivity-enhancing mergers; subsidizing more expensive clean energy; and even a universal basic income more is a way to divide a fixed pie, not grow it. Its proposed massive spending on social policy goals and redistribution would leave little to invest in national power industries. To be fair, neo-New Dealers are not averse to “industrial policy.” But most of their “investments” would be to advance their “green equity” agenda of clean energy, human service industries such as childcare and eldercare, subsidized housing, and mass transit. In a report for the Brookings Institution, Harvard professor Dani Rodrik has advocated for “good jobs,” including more jobs in nursing homes. [284] And of course, its anticorporate, neo-Brandeisian antitrust agenda would mean constant attacks on large corporations doing battle with CCP-backed national champions. And its pro-worker fixation would mean an anti-automation agenda, something that is critical to not losing to China that has the opposite effect: automation full steam ahead. Sadly, some Republicans have begun to embrace some of these progressive views, especially the animus toward large corporations, the focus on redistribution (in this case, to working-class families rather than on race, as the Democrats focus more on), and their putting worker interests ahead of national interests, especially related to automation and technology. [285] Emulating the progressives’ neo-New Dealism “middle-out” framing, Oren Cass, the founder and president of American Compass, a conservative reform organization, has written: This response emerges from an insight that I like to call the working hypothesis: that a labor market in which workers can support strong families and communities is the central determinant of long-term prosperity and should be the central focus of public policy. Genuine prosperity depends upon people working as productive contributors to their society, through which they can achieve self-sufficiency, support their families, participate in their communities, and raise children prepared to do the same. [286] The reality of the CCP’s techno-economic and trade war on the West undercuts the foundations of neo-New Deal progressivism. If the United States is in an existential contest for global power, then boosting taxing and regulations on business is especially ill-advised, as is the neo-Brandeisian campaign to destroy large corporations. As are unrestrained demands from organized labor. Progressive advocates know this quite well, which is why they go to any end to deny that China even is a competitor. [287] The grand strategy of stand and fight, ideally with the support of U.S. allies who hopefully don’t cave and strike their own separate Quisling deals, requires a coherent national power industry strategy. Free-market policy, and even a manufacturing policy, competitiveness policy, and innovation policy—none will get the United States where it needs to be, because, by definition, they are all agnostic to strategic industry capabilities. The problem is that Washington has virtually no experience with a national power industry strategy. There is neither the conceptual framework for how to craft a strategy, the institutional and legal frameworks to enact it, nor the skills in the federal workforce to manage it. The last time Washington tried do something like this was in WWII when the Roosevelt administration, under the leadership of “Big Bill” Knudsen and Henry Kaiser, organized industry into the arsenal of democracy. [288] Knudsen, then the CEO of General Motors, was put in charge of the Office of Production Management. His task was not to spur innovation or even generate more manufacturing, but rather to help American industry transition to build mass amounts of weapons to defeat our enemies. Kaiser, CEO of Kaiser Steel, was tasked with building a flotilla of “liberty ships.” At the same time, the Office of Scientific Research and Development was created to drive scientific and engineering research for military purposes. [289] That task, while daunting, was in many ways easier and more straightforward than today’s. The United States already had the world’s largest and most technologically sophisticated manufacturing sector. And the transition from trucks to tanks and passenger planes to bomber planes was not as complicated as it would be today, given the advanced technology involved in today’s weapons systems. And the focus was somewhat narrow: produce a massive amount of a relatively small variety of weapons. Today’s task is much harder. The United States has already lost significant manufacturing capabilities, and its “industrial commons” is hollower than it should be. And the focus must be much broader than just weapons systems, to include dual-use industries. That suggests that any effort needs to be guided by strategic analysis, not just throwing a jumble of disconnected policies and programs at the problem. The problem is that Washington has virtually no experience with a national power industry strategy. There is neither the conceptual framework for how to craft a strategy, the institutional and legal frameworks to enact it, nor the skills in the federal workforce to manage it. Where to start? Fortunately, the concept and theory of strategy have been formulated in business. Business schools have long had courses in strategy, and the number of books and articles published on the topic are legion. Business strategy is a much more valuable intellectual vein to mine compared with economics because, in contrast to the latter, which sees transactions as utility maximizing for both parties, business strategy sees competition as win-lose, exactly the dynamics between the United States and China. In addition, economics is largely based on theories, models, and equations and assumes that the real world fits the models—and when it doesn’t, economists complain about the world, not the models. And at the same time, the field of international affairs largely overlooks business competition, industry structure, and technology innovation. For both fields, the concept of technology is limited to things that are broadly familiar, such as AI and cybersecurity. Neither consider things such as catalysis, computer numerical control processes (CNC), or combustion engineering. And both assume, as Robert Solow did, that technology emerges out of nowhere, like manna from heaven. So, they don’t even contemplate the possibility of defeat. Rather, they assume there might be shocks that harm some blue collar workers, which is to be lamented and addressed with career training and free bus tickets to help them move out of their loser communities to the coasts, where they can aspire to become two-earner professional couples in more lucrative service industries. Business strategy can’t afford this luxury. It has to be based on ground truth reality, or as close as strategists can get to, because the costs of being wrong are usually obvious, immediate, and painful. A business strategy consultant, or a firm implementing business strategy that has the wrong strategic formulation, will soon be out of business. In contrast, economists are seldom if ever punished for being wrong. Just think that, in 2007, most economists, including Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and economists at the NY and Boston Fed and International Monetary Fund, said a nationwide housing price collapse was virtually impossible. It is hard to think of a single one that suffered professionally from this flawed ideologically based advice. Finally, good business strategy is based on a deep understanding of competitors, one’s own organizational capabilities, and threats and opportunities in the current and emergent environment. This kind of thinking is completely absent in economics, but it is central to national power industry competition. As such, it’s worth reviewing corporate strategy literature and then discussing how it can be applied to national power industry strategy. The godfather of corporate strategy, Harvard Business School’s Michael Porter, wrote: The essence of strategy formulation is coping with competition... Whatever their collective strength, the corporate strategists’ goal is to find position in the industry where his or her company can best defend itself against those forces or can influence them in its favor… Rivalry among existing competitors takes the familiar form of jockeying for position, product introduction, and advertising slugfests. [290] He went on to note, “Once the corporate strategist has assessed the forces affecting competition in his industry and their underlying causes, he can identify his company’s strengths and weaknesses.” [291] Strategy is always in the service of goals. And organizations and nations can have strategies or not. But what often passes for strategy in government is policy. Policy for nations is an amalgam of different government actions (e.g., different tax provisions, spending on a particular area, a specific regulation). If these are oriented toward a common goal, they can be described as a comprehensive policy for “x” (climate, innovation, equity, etc.). But policy is not strategy. Strategy is the use of policies to achieve particular outcomes that take into account the overall internal and external environment. What should be the goal of national economic strategy? That is the single most important question and the one that must be answered first and gotten right. Organizations have an easier time agreeing on a goal. For most companies, the goal is maximizing profits—ideally net present value profits. Not only do nations seek to achieve many goals, but also the process of deciding on these goals, at least in democracies, is messy to say the least. When it comes to economic goals, for the last half century or so, the United States has not been able to come close to agreeing on an overarching one. Some on the Right put freedom from government as the paramount goal, with the belief that this will solve any and all economic problems. But as noted previously, there is no logical reason why a laissez-faire policy would lead to a strong competitive position in national power industries that the United States must be strong at to compete with China. Free-market advocates either deny that the U.S. needs industrial capabilities in key industries or simply assert that this is the role for defense spending. Policy is not strategy. Strategy is the use of policies to achieve particular outcomes that take into account the overall internal and external environment. The problem with the latter approach is twofold. First, defense capabilities increasingly rely on commercial capabilities, and what use to be mostly spin-off (defense innovations being used by the commercial sector) are now more spin-on (commercial innovations being used by defense). [292] This is one reason for the creation of organizations such as In-Qtel, the Defense Innovation Unit, and DOD’s Office of Strategic Capital. Second, even if DOD could create its own self-sufficient and technologically advanced ecosystem, with rest of the economy being law firms, personal service firms, and retail, the costs would be enormous. For example, commercial semiconductor manufacturing relies on mass production to achieve economies of scale and drive down costs. A defense-only model would forego these benefits, leading to vastly higher prices per chip. Moreover, with no commercial partner to share the cost, DOD would have to bear the full expense of developing custom technologies for its unique security, performance, and radiation-hardening needs. While the free-market hold on Washington thinking has lessened in the last decade especially, it’s possible that replacement doctrines, while better, all suffer from systematic limitations for being guides to a national power industry strategy. This is true even for the new manufacturing reshoring doctrine, that many on the Right and the Left have embraced. In this doctrine, restoring manufacturing is the overarching economic goal. In this narrative, the goal should be to restore the working class to its prior position and advocates to see the way to do this by boosting manufacturing, regardless of sector. But even if the United States grew manufacturing so much that it eliminated its manufacturing trade deficit, the number of blue-collar jobs that would be created would be modest at best, less than 2 percent of the U.S. workforce. [293] And like the free-market doctrine, there is no logical reason why a manufacturing doctrine would lead to a strong competitive position in the national power industries the United States must be strong in to not lose to China. It might very well grow consumer sectors such as furniture and plastics, but not power sectors such as aerospace and biotech. The same problems exist with those that embrace the competitiveness and innovation policy doctrines. These doctrines rightly want government to do more to spur competitiveness, especially of advanced sectors and technological innovation broadly. And certainly, more of both would be better and would contribute to boosting U.S. power. But again, there is no reason why generic competitiveness and innovation strategies (e.g., more STEM immigration, a stronger R&D tax credit, more federal support for science) would necessarily preserve critically needed national power industries. The same is true for the new fashionable “Abundance” and “Progress” movements. [294] These movements rightly argue that America needs to once again embrace progress and risk taking, and that we need to significantly reduce the barriers to building things. They want to “shape the progress movement into a cultural force.” [295] But while certainly useful and needed, to think that fewer regulations, a bit more policy risk taking, and more general optimism of the future is enough to not lose the national power industry war is to not understand the nature of the challenge. [296] Competitiveness policy is indifferent to particular industries and therefore there is no need to conduct strategic industry strategy. Finally, there are those who are indifferent to industrial development and have an anticapitalist, neo-New Deal doctrine. The Democratic Left is increasingly focused on economic, social, and demographic equity and the fight against the privileged classes. To the extent it has an industrial strategy, it is for human services industries such as day care and elder care. In addition, much of the Left’s support for industrial policy is actually climate policy, such as supporting the Inflation Reduction Act to spur the building of factories producing renewable energy technologies. But for the most part, with the exception of motor vehicles, these sectors are not strategic in relation to China. For example, if China cut off exports of solar panels, the effect would not be felt immediately and other electricity generation technologies, such as natural gas turbines, could be used. That leaves national power industry strategy. [297] It is a subset of competitiveness policy, but differs in one critical way. Competitiveness policy is indifferent to particular industries and therefore there is no need to conduct strategic industry strategy. But before delving into national power industry strategy, it’s worth examining competitiveness strategy and its limitations. Figure 6: Relationship between competitiveness strategy and national power industry strategy It would seem that competitiveness policy should be the replacement doctrine to neoclassical consumer welfare-focused economics. But while it is closer to the solution we need than consumer-welfare economics or neo-New Deal economics is, it cannot be the guide for the simple reason that it does not prioritize defending key industries. Competitiveness policy is much broader, relating to a more robust competitive trade position for U.S. companies—like how manufacturing policy is indifferent to strategic sectors, competitiveness policy is even more indifferent, as it is agnostic whether the United States is competitive in goods or services. When it comes to national competitiveness strategy the bible remains Michael Porter’s The Competitive Advantage of Nations , published in 1990. The book was a major contribution to the debate at the time, and it remains highly influential for how competitiveness experts and politicians think about the issue. Because of that, it is worth examining what Porter got right and what he got wrong, especially for today’s China era. Porter got much right. First, he rightly pointed out that national prosperity is created, not inherited, a direct challenge to much of international trade theory at the time, which still believed in comparative, rather than competitive advantage. Second, Porter pointed out that competitive advantage is something governments should strive for—yet is something most U.S. economists still question. Third, he stressed the importance of innovation in creating competitive advantage. Fourth, he built theories of competitive advantage up from the experience of industries, not down from broad macro conditions. This is critical because almost all that passes for competitiveness or industrial policy today ignores industry analytics. As Porter wrote, “The particular industry—passenger cars, facsimile machines, accounting services, ball bearings—is where competitive advantage of firms is either won or lost.” [298] He went on to note that “firms play a central role in the process of creating competitive advantage.” [299] This is why he wrote that his theory drew on several fields, including of course the business literature of competitive strategy, but also fields of “technological innovation, industrial economics, economic development, economic geography, international trade, political science, and industrial sociology.” [300] Note that he did not include macro- and micro-economics, the disciplines that dominate economic policy thinking in the United States. The fields Porter drew from are largely ignored in Washington in favor a sterile and model-based abstract economics. Fifth, he brought in the critical field of strategy, writing that “a new theory must reflect a rich conception of competition that includes segmented markets, differentiated products, technological differences and economies of scale … and process innovation.” [301] Despite Porter’s contribution, these insights have had virtually no impact in Washington, where sectoral level analysis and strategy largely do not exist and where macro-economists and finance experts run economic policy. Sixth, Porter demonstrated the importance of dynamic, not static, competition—something that today’s economic theory, including antitrust, too often misses. As he wrote, “In actual competition, the essential character is innovation and change. Instead of being limited to passively shifting resources to where the returns are the greatest, the real issue is how firms increase the returns available through new products and processes.” [302] Seventh, he recognized a role for government, something most economists deny or minimize. But as discussed ahead, Porter significantly underestimated that role, as almost all corporate strategists still do. Much of what Porter wrote represents an important contribution to the understanding of national competitiveness. But Porter’s thinking, and the thinking of other experts and organizations who have adopted the conventional Porter-inspired competitiveness framework, contains fatal flaws that make policy recommendations stemming from it be inadequate at best, and harmful at worst. His cardinal intellectual sin was that he wrongly argued that “the only meaningful concept of competitiveness at the national level is national productivity.” [303] At one level, it’s surprising that someone of his stature could make such a fundamental error of logic as this, but few scholars can escape their intellectual background when delving into adjacent fields, and his background was in how firms boost their profits (e.g., productivity). Others have followed his framing. WEF’s Global Competitiveness Report defines competitiveness as “the set of institutions, policies, and factors that determine the level of productivity of a country.” [304] And IMD’s World Competitiveness Yearbook defines competitiveness similarly, but more broadly, as how an “economy manages the totality of its resources and competencies to increase the prosperity of its population.” [305] But while these two terms are related, competitiveness should not be equated with productivity or GDP growth. To see why, it’s important to differentiate between traded and nontraded industries. A traded industry is one in which the firms sell a significant share of their output outside a particular geographical area. For example, a printing firm in Michigan that sells printed material to customers across the United States would be a traded firm from the perspective of the Michigan economy, but a nontraded firm from the perspective of the U.S. economy. In contrast, a software firm in Washington that sells software throughout the world would be a traded firm from the state and national perspective. Porter’s thinking contains fatal flaws that make policy recommendations stemming from it be inadequate at best, and harmful at worst. Thus, competitiveness relates only to the economic health of a region’s or nation’s traded sectors. (For the purpose of this memo, the term “region” shall refer to both national and subnational economies) But how do we define health? One definition is jobs. But this can’t be right, because if one region’s traded sector is highly productive, it will have fewer jobs than another region’s traded sector that is less productive, yet it may be more competitive. Another definition is value added—the amount of value that traded sector firms add to the inputs of production that they purchase. This is closer to the right definition, but it fails to control for the extent to which a region’s economy is traded. One region’s economy might be more traded than another’s and therefore its traded sector is larger, but it might have vastly more imports, meaning that its traded sector is not holding its own when it comes to competitiveness. But even this is not quite precise enough, for one region might run a trade surplus but do so by subsidizing its exporters (e.g., by manipulating its currency) or erecting barriers to importers (e.g., tariffs). In this case, the trade surplus may not be a reflection of the true competitiveness of the region’s traded sector firms, but rather a reflection of the extent of mercantilist aid the traded sector firms receive. This sets up the true definition: competitiveness is the ability of an economy to export more in value-added terms than it imports, while accounting for the “terms of trade” to reflect all government “discounts” (including an artificially low currency, suppressed wages in export sectors, artificially low taxes on traded sector firms, and direct subsidies to exports), as well as foreign barriers to its exports (both tariff and nontariff). Under this definition, a nation may run a large trade surplus (one component of competitiveness), but if it does so by providing large “discounts” to its exporters or by blocking imports, it would not be truly competitive, for such policies would reduce its terms of trade by requiring its residents to give up some of their income to foreign consumers, pay higher prices for foreign goods and services, or both. We can see this by looking at past trends in the U.S. trade deficit. When the rise in the relative price of imports brought about through the lower value of the dollar in the last half of the 1980s helped reduce the U.S. trade deficit, it also reduced the U.S. terms of trade (the United States could buy fewer imports for the same quantity of exports). Therefore, U.S. competitiveness was unchanged even as the trade deficit declined. Likewise, the fact that the United States runs a massive trade deficit today but many of its trading partners run surpluses by means of massive “discounting” (including currency manipulation) and import blocking means that we cannot determine with certainty that the U.S. economy is uncompetitive. In fact, despite numerous studies claiming to compare national competitiveness, no study to date has actually done this because none has fully accounted for the magnitude of export discounting and import blocking, in part because the data is extremely difficult to collect. While data exists on trade balances for virtually all nations, data on the extent of export discounts and import blocking (especially through nontariff barriers) is difficult to obtain. Despite this, at a cursory level, it would appear that nations such as Austria, Germany, and Sweden would be on a list of competitive economies (they run trade surpluses while also having relatively high wages and limited other discounts). In contrast, nations such as China (too much discounting) and the United States (too large a trade deficit even when accounting for foreign subsidies) would likely not make the list of competitive economies. How does productivity fit into competitiveness? Productivity can enable competitiveness, especially if it is concentrated in traded sectors, which lowers costs and enables firms to sell more in global markets without relying on government-provided discounts. But productivity growth can also be relatively unrelated to competitiveness if it is concentrated in nontraded sectors. Imagine a nation with strong productivity growth but almost all of it in nontraded sectors such as grocery stores, electric utilities, and nursing homes. Certainly, incomes would go up as relative prices in these sectors fell, but firms in traded sectors would only see modest reductions in their costs based on the extent of purchased inputs from nontraded firms. The United States could very well be much stronger internationally with no trade deficit and no diminution of the value of the dollar and still see key industries beaten and destroyed by China. Porter recognized that “to firms, competitiveness meant the ability to compete in world markets.” [306] Although he should have added the caveat that this only matters for firms in traded industries, not domestic serving industries. But he can’t go to the next logical step of saying that to nations, competitiveness meant the ability to compete in world markets. Presumably, this is because he worried that it would empower protectionists who cared about deindustrialization. But in fact, countries do compete, as we will see ahead regarding China. But even this true definition of competitiveness still does not address the core existential challenge facing the United States: predation by China for strategic industries. The United States could very well be much stronger internationally with no trade deficit and no diminution of the value of the dollar and still see key industries beaten and destroyed by China. It could boost exports in tourism, banking, consulting, higher education, natural resources, food products, plastics, and furniture but lose is aerospace, machinery, biotech, semiconductors, and other advanced industries to China. Before discussing the concept and importance of strategic national power industries, it’s important to consider the other major problems in Porter’s work, because so many people continue to rely on the Porter framework even though it no longer applies to the world the United States finds itself in today. A Focus on Democratic Nations: First, Porter analyzed democratic, capitalist nations; not China. As such, he made two key assumptions. One was that other countries would generally play by the rules. And two was that it was okay if U.S. firms disinvested in certain industries. It didn’t matter if other nations won in certain industries, as long as the United States’ firms generally invested in areas they had competitive advantage in. In fact, Porter did not even mention China in his book. The assumptions he made about the competitive environment of firms in the United States or any of the countries he advised simply do not hold when it comes to China. Porter was writing about capitalism, not state capitalism. And state capitalism changes everything. Among other items, he assumed that 1) foreign firms would not engage in systematic dumping; 2) nations would not be able to afford massive subsidies to targeted industries; 3) to the extent they did dump or subsidize, national trade policies would effectively respond to such policies; and 4) foreign markets would generally be open to imports, and if they were not, negotiations would pry them open. Of course, none of that applies to Chinese state capitalism. Porter went on to claim that “subsidies of any kind will have little leverage when competition is based on quality, rapid product development, and advanced features.” [307] But what about when the competitor has pretty good quality, fairly rapid product development, and many advanced features but on top of that has massive subsidies from the government? This describes many Chinese firms. Then those subsidies provide massive leverage. Moreover, in many markets, particularly middle-income countries, price matters more and buyers are willing to buy Chinese goods that are not quite as good as American because of the strong price advantage. Porter ignores this because he couldn’t conceive of what China became and didn’t anticipate the strong growth of global GDP in developing markets. Porter was writing about capitalism, not state capitalism. And state capitalism changes everything. To the extent Porter envisioned tough price competition, his advice was that firms downsize and even exit, because competing on price is a fool’s errand. And he applied this advice to governments to give up on industries that they couldn’t easily compete in because of price, even if most of the price differential was due to unfair government practices. Porter also wrote that companies, and nations by extension, should give short shrift to unfair foreign trade practices. For Porter, this just opened up rent seeking that ultimately kept firms from evolving. In fact, he noted unfair trade practices with italics (“unfair”) to suggest that they really are not unfair. He argued that firms and governments pushing pack against foreign unfair trade practices “postpone change, dampen innovation … and work in exactly the wrong direction from those necessary for competitive advantage.” [308] This is clearly wrong. If it’s true, why not encourage other nations to ramp up unfair advantages, as doing so would really motivate U.S. firms to compete. But if the unfairness is actually a Colt 45 to the head, as it is with China, it won’t motivate, it will decimate. Porter also applied the same corollary to domestic policy, when he wrote, “Direct government ‘assistance’ [again note the quotation marks to imply that it is not actually assisting] in one firm or industry also has a strong tendency to create forces that cause it to spread and multiply.” [309] He was writing as if assistance were highly contagious and a deadly communicable disease and not a key factor to respond to Chinese power industry predation. Related to this, and reflecting his firm orientation, Porter repeatedly rejected the idea that nations should seek to address systematic cost disadvantages, in fact, bizarrely saying that these are good, as they spur firms to compete and innovate more. Perhaps, but not when the cost differentials are large and persistent as they are vis-à-vis the United States and China. Perhaps betraying his lack of understanding of international economics Porter did not appear to ever consider that currency is the natural market adjustment mechanism in international trade except that it doesn’t work for the United States because the dollar is the reserve currency. A Limited Role for Government: Second, Porter only saw a limited role for government in boosting firm or industry competitiveness. The role of government “is inevitably partial.” [310] When a nation’s companies are competing against companies from other nations that generally play by the rules, perhaps this framing is correct. Although Porter largely ignored the key role the USG played in the development of many industries, including shipbuilding, aerospace, semiconductors, and interchangeable parts. But again, in a world where China practices techno-economic predation, such a limited role is by definition a death sentence for domestic industry that China targets. He applied his famous Porter diamond of five forces that affect firm competitiveness to national policy. These were threat of new entrants, bargaining power of suppliers, bargaining power of buyers, threat of substitute products or services, and in the middle, rivalry among existing competitors. For countries, he listed four: national factor conditions, firm strategy, structure and rivalry, related and supporting industries, and demand conditions. But this reflects his overarching ideology of limited government, a blind spot most business strategists suffer from. Sure, government can build some roads and fund some R&D and put in place some regulations. But under no circumstances should it be involved in industry strategy. Porter’s theory allowed firm exit from markets, and in fact actively supported it. But countries cannot allow power industry exit unless they want less power. He made assumptions that at least in the case of China are not true as when he said that “even when staffed with the most elite civil servants, governments make erratic decisions about the industry to develop, the technologies to invest in, and the competitive advantages that will be the most appropriate and achievable.” [311] Yet, he assumed that leaving these choices to a nation’s firms would maximize competitiveness: which Porter meant as productivity. Porter opposed governments targeting particular industries because “targeting distorts market signals by altering the incentives of private firms to compete in an industry.” [312] He wrote that when government distorts market signals, especially through direct targeting, it cannot rely on firms to invest only in fundamentally sound industries. It places the burden on government planners to understand the subtle conditions for national advantage.” [313] He went on to complain that “one nation after another crowds into the same industries,” creating overcapacity. [314] Perhaps in a pre-China world this might have some basis, but not now. When China targets U.S. firms with attacks, fundamentally distorting market forces, not responding distorts market forces. Nations Can Choose Any Industry: Porter’s third error was that he treated industry choice the way companies treated it. Profit-making companies are indifferent about the industry they are in, as long as they maximize profits. So should nations be, said Porter, writing, “Manufacturing is not ‘better’ than services … because many services involve sophisticated technology and high levels of productivity.” [315] If the goal is productivity, Porter was correct. Whatever set of industries maximize productivity are the best ones. But if the goal is competitiveness, and in particular power industry competitiveness, then nations cannot be indifferent about which industries they are strong in. Porter’s theory allowed firm exit from markets, and in fact actively supported it. But countries cannot allow power industry exit unless they want less power. Cost Competition Is Not Key: Fourth, Porter rejected cost competition. Like almost all strategy gurus, he advised firms to not engage in slugging it out in price competition because doing so eroded margins. Better to find ways to move up the value chain or seek niches that maintain margins. If that doesn’t work, then shrink. But that clearly cannot be the answer for strategic industries. The United States does not have the luxury of getting out of industries such as semiconductors and aerospace even if China attacks the margins. He wrote that a “10 percent cost saving through economies of scale … is nullified quickly by rapid product and process improvement.” [316] But in a hyper-competitive environment with China, where it will have the former and the latter, not pursuing the former is a recipe for market share loss. Porter’s third error was that he treated industry choice the way companies treated it. Profit-making companies are indifferent about the industry they are in, as long as they maximize profits. So should nations be. Top-Line Growth Is Key: Fifth, Porter reflected the common view in the business strategy literature that the best strategy is to go for top-line growth in new markets, rather than slugging it out with other firms in existing markets. He wrote, “The most sustainable strategies are those that widen and upgrade the market rather than simply taking business away from foreign firms.” [317] That might be a good strategy for firms that have no fundamental responsibility for maintaining production of power goods. But it is a defeating strategy for nations. Firms Must Choose Between Cost and Differentiation: His sixth error was in assuming that firms had a fundamental choice in industry positioning between lower cost and differentiation. This was common business strategy advice at the time. As David Moshella argued: In 1995, Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema argued that companies could excel in one of three areas— product leadership (PL), operational efficiency (OE), or customer intimacy (CI) 7 . Strategically, they needed to choose which discipline to focus on, and then be competitive in the other two. This thinking made great sense in the pre-digital age—with Sony (PL), McDonald’s (OE), and the Ritz-Carlton (CI) serving as iconic examples of each approach. But the digital leaders shown in the figure typically excel in all three dimensions. For example, Amazon and Netflix have the widest product selection, the most efficient operations, and the most personalized customer experience in their respective markets. [318] That was certainly true when he wrote the book Seeing Digital: A Visual Guide to the Industries, Organizations, and Careers of the 2020s . [319] But the emergence of digital technologies has made that much less true. Digital-first companies can now achieve low costs, high quality, and differentiation. That means the safety niche of moving upscale to differentiation is less safe from attack. One key aspect of Porter’s work (and others in the field) is the idea of bad competitors. For anyone who plays poker, a bad player is someone who is so bad they don’t know when the opponent is making a great bluff and hence stay in and win. In the case of bad competitors, Porter argues they have several characteristics. First, they are aggressive price cutters even if doing so hurts their long-term profitability and overall industry profitability. Second, they are low-differentiation players that offer similar products with little or no differentiation, making it difficult for any firm to establish a sustainable competitive advantage. Third, they are unstable participants that enter an industry with aggressive tactics and limited resources, potentially destabilizing the market. And finally, they are high-stakes competitors that are heavily invested in an industry and will fight aggressively to maintain their position, even during downturns. These factors largely describe Chinese competitors that, for the most part, are bad competitors employing almost militaristic, scorched-earth policies. They aggressively cut prices, not worrying about year after year of losses, usually backed up by Chinese government deep pockets. This China price—aggressive pricing—destroys gross margins industry-wide. Second, they specialize in copycat products. Third, they aggressively enter new industries such as biotech, aerospace, and high-speed rail where they have little experience and ultimately completely destabilizing markets, in part because they end up closing their own markets to competition. And finally, they don’t blink in either economy- or industry-wide downturns; they keep investing and expanding, leading to global overcapacity. U.S. and allied nations must prepare for a decades-long siege wherein a share of national income will have to be devoted to shoring up power industries in order to endure grueling trench warfare. When it comes to dealing with such competitors in normal countries, Porter proposed three possible strategies. First, abandon the industry. If the industry is structurally unattractive due to bad competitors and offers limited profit potential, a company might choose to exit the market and pursue opportunities elsewhere. Or it might abandon the United States and seek to match the artificial China price by moving production to China, or more recently, to even lower-cost locations such as India. Or it might go “asset-light” and outsource capital-intensive, lower-margin shares of the business to other companies, including companies outside the United States. In these situations, it makes little economic sense to invest, which is why so many companies return free cash to shareholders through stock buybacks. But this is temporary strategy at best. Moreover, both strategies hollow out domestic industrial capacity: strategy 1 directly reduces the manufacturing base, while Strategy 2 degrades supplier ecosystems and workforce capabilities. The result is a self-reinforcing cycle wherein American firms lose the ability to scale innovation and compete in advanced manufacturing, validating Andy Grove’s 2010 warning about the strategic risks of abandoning production competencies. [320] While this might be useful for the company in the short run, eventually, the company will have few places to run. And more importantly, abandonment is not a choice that countries seeking to maintain national techno-economic power can make. Second, convert bad competitors. Porter says that a c ompany might try to influence or educate bad competitors to adopt more sustainable competitive practices, such as focusing on differentiation or value-added services. Perhaps this might work with a normal company in a normal government, but it absolutely will not work with China. For at least two decades, U.S. policymakers thought that if they just engaged in enough dialogue, they could show the CCP the error of its ways and that it would start to compete fairly. Needless to say, that proved to be false. If neither of these two steps is possible, Porter advised preparing for a siege . In t his case, the company needs to adopt a long-term strategy focused on cost leadership or differentiation while enduring intense competition and potentially lower profits. That is what U.S. and allied nations must do: prepare for a decades-long siege wherein a share of national income will have to be devoted to shoring up power industries in order to endure grueling trench warfare. America needs a national power industry strategy. Conventional consumer-welfare economics won’t cut it, nor will progressive neo-New Dealism. Competitiveness, innovation, and manufacturing policy, while closer, all fall short of the mark. While there was considerable excellent work done on competitiveness policy, including by scholars such as John Zysman, Laura Tyson, Robert Hayes, Lester Thurow, Michael Piorre, James Womack, Annalee Saxenian, Ira Magaziner, and others in the 1980s and 1990s, that work did not have to focus on national power industries because our core competitors—particularly Japan and Germany—were allies. [321] Finally, new concepts such as the “abundance movement,” at best address only small parts of the challenge. For a national power industry strategy, the first issue is to identify which industries (products in business strategy terms) to compete for. And the second is development of an action plan based on an amalgam of deep industry analyses. What to do? Unfortunately, in part because the United States has never faced this kind of challenge before, there is little intellectual work on which to build. As discussed, the closest is the field of business strategy. We need to look at this field, not for cookie cutter answers, but rather for inspiration and ideas that can be built upon to construct a national power industry strategy framework. What is business strategy? It is not culture. It is not operational excellence. It is not planning and policy. Rather, strategy is about positioning and reacting. As strategy guru Roger Martin has written: Planning and strategy are two fundamentally different actions—and conflating them undermines performance. Planning is about allocating resources and setting out actions within a company’s control, like opening a new plant or hiring staff. Strategy, on the other hand, is about making a coherent set of choices that position an organization to win in a specific market. [322] One business strategy article argues that a business strategy has two core elements: The first is the product-market investment decision which includes the product-market scope of the business strategy, its investment intensity and the resource allocation in a multiple business context. The alternatives range from a withdrawal from a business area to a milking strategy to various growth strategies such as market share growth, or expansion of the product line or served market. The second core element is the development of a sustainable competitive advantage which encompasses underlying distinctive competences or assets, appropriate objectives, functional area policies, and the creation of synergy. A sustainable competitive advantage is usually based upon a strong point of differentiation such as product quality, a sustainable cost advantage, or a focus upon one or more market segments. [323] In other words, for a national power industry strategy, the first issue is to identify which industries (products in business strategy terms) to compete for. And the second is development of an action plan based on an amalgam of deep industry analyses. Business strategy is a much more effective source of information for a national power industry strategy than conventional dominant consumer welfare economics. First, unlike consumer welfare economics, which assumes in the Ricardian framework that trade is win-win, business strategy sees competition as mostly win-lose, with market share gains of one company coming at the expense of a competitor. And that is exactly what the U.S.-China techno-economic and trade relationship is. The PricewaterhouseCoopers journal Strategy and Business wrote: The concept of strategy originates in war, where the objective is to destroy the enemy. In business, if the enemy is your competitor, then the objective of strategy must be to crush the competition. Michael Porter gave academic standing to this way of thinking when he made popular the idea of “competitive advantage” with his best-selling textbook, Competitive Strategy , published in 1980. [324] One leading strategy book from 1986, Marketing Warfare, notes that it : applies military strategic principles to business competition, outlining four primary competitive strategies: defensive warfare (for market leaders), offensive warfare (for strong challengers), flanking attacks (for smaller players finding undefended market segments), and guerrilla warfare (for small companies using focused, limited attacks). [325] Second, unlike consumer welfare economics, which assumes that all industries are similar (they all compete on demand and supply), business strategy also is grounded in recognition that industries (and technologies) are fundamentally different, and require different strategies. And that matters when competing with China because winning in biopharmaceuticals requires a very different kind of strategy than competing in quantum computing. Third, unlike consumer welfare economics, business strategy largely sees firm inputs as undifferentiated commodities firms can buy in markets. Business strategy recognizes the many different factors that go into a firm being able to win competitive challenges, including taxes. This is key because winning (or at least not losing) in various national power industries requires understanding that each requires unique inputs and policies. The concepts in business strategy are vastly richer than economics, wherein everything boils down to supply and demand, profit and loss, and allocation efficiency. Finally, unlike consumer welfare economics, which assumes that national economies tend toward a state of equilibrium, business strategy, especially work after the late 1990s, assumes a constant dynamic process. And also unlike consumer welfare economics, which assumes that innovation is constant, essentially “manna from heaven,” business strategy sees it as intentional. UC Berkely professor David Teece wrote: Dynamic capability is “the firm’s ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments.” Dynamic capabilities can be distinguished from operational or “ordinary” capabilities, which pertain to the current operations of an organization. Dynamic capabilities, by contrast, refer to “the capacity of an organization to purposefully create, extend, or modify its resource base.” [326] As one article notes, “Competitive dynamics refer to a series of attacks and counterattacks launched by companies operating in a particular market to strengthen their competitive positions, where strategic actions by one firm often trigger reactions from rival firms.” [327] The concepts in business strategy are vastly richer than economics, wherein everything boils down to supply and demand, profit and loss, and allocation efficiency. In other words, if you would have one discipline to shape national techno-economic and trade policy, economists or business scholars we would be better off with the latter. While certain sub-disciplines of economics such as industrial organization and regional economics address some of these concepts, by and large, consumer welfare economics glosses over them. These concepts include the following: ▪ Choices of technology leapfrogging ▪ Overcoming latecomer disadvantages ▪ Role of market share building ▪ Fixed costs and variable costs and impacts on marginal costs ▪ Economies of scope and scale ▪ Importance of execution vs. strategy ▪ Sources of competitive advantage (price, quality, customization, innovation) ▪ Incremental vs. disruptive innovation ▪ Organizational culture and resistance to disruptive innovation ▪ Turnaround strategies vs. sustaining ▪ Experience curve and learning curve [328] ▪ Growth-share matrix [329] ▪ Cost advantage vs. differentiation ▪ Barriers to entry ▪ Product life cycle and commodification ▪ Market growth rates ▪ Sustaining vs. disruptive innovation ▪ Industry positioning ▪ Market scope (local, national, global) ▪ Kinds of innovation (product, process, business model) ▪ Kinds of competition (dynamic vs. static) ▪ Industry externalities ▪ Network effects ▪ Agglomeration (localization and urbanization) ▪ First mover vs. latecomer advantages [330] ▪ Threat of entry and barriers to entry ▪ Expected retaliation from incumbent ▪ Substitutability ▪ Modularity These and other business strategy concepts can be incorporated into the shaping of a national power industry strategy and the multitude of sub-industry strategies that must be developed. While the business strategy frame offers a much more promising foundation to build on, there are important ways it does not fully translate for the establishment of a national power industry strategy. First, business strategy is based on indifference to strategic sectors. If Intel can make more money by becoming a fabless chip designer than it can competing with the likes of TSMC to produce chips, by all means it should do this. But that cannot be an acceptable outcome from a power industry strategy because the nation needs leading chipmakers that are headquartered in the United States. Second, business strategy advises firms to not slug it out in markets based on cost competition. Pretty much every business strategy tells business executives to retreat to higher-margin parts of the business. This may or may not be good business advice, but it also might be bad in that it assumes that the cost challenger is consigned to cost competition, not other forms of higher-margin competition such as quality, customization, or brand. But either way, it is poor strategy for a nation seeking to not lose in cost competition because China always starts industry competition with a cost assault—and if U.S. firms fold and run at the first whiff of gunpowder, America will lose power industry capabilities. Besides, Chinese firms have shown that they always intend to move up the value chain and attack the high-margin segments. Going asset-light is usually counter to the goals of a national power industry strategy, which is based on boosting capital assets in country. Third, some of the business strategy literature, and most of the equity market advice, is for firms to maximize return on net assets. A key way to do boost this ratio is to reduce net assets. Companies do this by going asset-light and outsourcing more capital-intensive work to other companies that presumably don’t listen to business consultants. This way, capital can be freed up for other uses, such as stock buybacks. This may or may not be a good strategy to maximize long-term profitability and net-present value returns. But going asset-light is usually counter to the goals of a national power industry strategy, which is based on boosting capital assets in country. As one article notes, “ The tension is often between financial goals, such as cash flow and profit, and strategic goals, such as market position and growth.” [331] For a corporation, the former dominate. For a country, the latter must dominate. Fourth, of course, is that the fundamental goals and operations of an economy are different than that of a firm, and the business strategy literature largely ignores the role of the state. It is instructive that chapter 12 of Porter’s book Competitive Advantage of Nations is not “government strategy” but “government policy.” This is key. The competitiveness community eschews strategy, but without it, we can’t solve for China strategic industry aggression. Box 5: Shih-Paisano Industry Classification Model At the same time, calls for massive reshoring ignore the fact that it makes sense to rely on global supply chains for at least some manufacturing production. One useful framework for thinking about this comes from Harvard Business School professors Gary Pisano and Willy Shih. [332] They have argued that the degree to which it makes sense to offshore production or keep it at home depends on two factors: process maturity (the extent to which the technologies used to produce a product are mature or continuing to evolve) and modularity (the degree to which information about product design can be separated from the manufacturing industry). Their argument is that in industries with high modularity and mature production processes, offshoring in order to lower costs makes good business sense and does not come at the cost of product or process innovation. They put the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in this category; the production process is relatively mature and product innovation (the development of new drugs) is not dependent on close linkages to the production process. This is why a significant share of API production has moved offshore. In contrast, they’ve argued that biotechnology production (the production of large-molecule, living compounds) is not a mature production process and there are closer links between drug development and drug production. This is why a much larger share of biotechnology production is still in the United States. There are at least five main policy implications from this. The first is that, to the extent that policy can spur more drug innovation, especially in large-molecule, biotech drugs, it is more likely that production will be located in the United States. The converse is also true: the more there is a push to replace novel drugs with generics, the more likely that supply will be filled through offshore production. As Shih and Pisano wrote, in sectors developing breakthrough products at the frontiers of science, the major process innovations are evolving rapidly and are critical to product innovation. Later reports in this series will lay out in greater detail a national power industry strategy, including a comprehensive list of actionable policy steps America needs to take. For now, a broad framework follows. As in any conflict, there are two main tactics: strengthening one’s own forces and slowing the advance of the adversary’s forces or even degrading them. The former tactic requires a coherent national strategy to bolster domestic economic power. The latter requires steps to limit the PRC’s advances in national power industries. Both are required to succeed. The PRC’s subsidies and other weapons are so powerful that responding by simply boosting America’s domestic capabilities will not be enough, because for a variety of reasons the United States and core allies will never be able to do enough to counter PRC advantage. To slow Chinese gains, the United States and its core allies need to take actions in four areas: 1) limiting Chinese knowledge acquisition; 2) limiting Chinese imports and investment in U.S. and key allied markets; 3) reducing allied firms’ production in China; and 4) contesting Chinese firms in non-allied markets. Doing all of this will require a host of detailed legislative actions, plus administrative follow-up and enforcement. The PRC’s subsidies and other weapons are so powerful that responding by simply boosting America’s domestic capabilities will not be enough. Meanwhile, spurring U.S. and allied gains also will require action in four main areas. First, allied nations need to invest much more in the foundations of technology-based competitiveness, including R&D and skills development in science, technology, and engineering. And these initiatives will need to be structured and targeted in new ways for national power industries, working closely with industry leaders and experts. At the same time, a wide range of federal policies and programs need to be scrapped or modernized for the new era—especially environmental regulations, immigration policy, antitrust policy, tax policy, and economic policies pertaining to small businesses and industrial support. Second, it’s time to jettison the entire idea of free trade agreements. The very concept is based on the quasi-utopian idea that all nations are allies and inherently free traders. Alas, the last 15 years have proved that vision is deficient. Rather than free trade agreements, the United States needs to take the lead in forming strategic national power industry partnerships with allies that are willing to stand up against the CCP’s techno-economic aggression. These partnerships would require not only eliminating virtually all trade and investment barriers, but also requiring that each nation commits to limiting Chinese investment in their domestic markets, adopts a robust export-control and outward bound investment-review regime when it comes to China, agrees to share commercial counterintelligence, and engages in close techno-industrial partnerships. The U.S. government needs to craft industry-specific strategies as part of an overarching national power industry strategy. Third, as American capitalism and corporate financing have evolved into a finance-driven system that presses companies to be asset-light and to prioritize short-term returns, U.S. firms’ ability to robustly fight this techno-economic war has declined. They are competing with Chinese firms that are willing to accept zero or negative returns; that receive massive subsidies for capital investment; and that are prepared to slug it out in market competition until capitalist adversaries throw in the towel. While specific techno-industrial development policies are needed, as long as those incentives are in place for Chinese firms, it will be critical for the United States to provide incentives for even the most patriotically minded CEO not to act in ways that will lose the war. That will likely entail thoroughly overhauling the corporate tax code to reduce or eliminate incentives for short-termism, while at the same time putting in place positive incentives for long-term investment, such as a stronger R&D tax credit and an investment tax credit. Fouth, the U.S. government needs to craft industry-specific strategies as part of an overarching national power industry strategy. Industries are all different in terms of their structures, competitive forces, technology needs, and other factors. While generic support policies like the R&D credit, infrastructure, and science investment can help the overall innovation and competitiveness environment, they lack the specificity needed to help firms in the United States compete effectively in global markets. So, we need a national semiconductor strategy, a national biopharma strategy, a national machine tool and robotics strategy, a national aerospace strategy, and more. These strategies would assess industries’ strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in a classic “SWOT” analysis, and examine how a wide array of federal, state, and local policies impact their power and competitiveness. Box 6: National Power Industry Policy vs. Industrial Policy At first glance, it would appear that national power industry strategy and traditional industrial policy (industrial policy designed around U.S. competitiveness, as opposed to industrial policy for social goals such as climate change or social welfare) would be quite similar. They are at the same level, as they both reject consumer-welfare, free-market economics and envision an active role for government in boosting value added output in certain industries. But there is where their similarity ends. Traditional industrial policy advocates stress its benefits for productivity. Oren Cass has stated that industrial policy is needed because the industries it grows “are actually the place where we get a lot of our productivity growth over time.” [333] But that’s no longer true, as manufacturing productivity growth has lagged behind overall economy productivity growth over the last 15 years or so. The pro-industrial policy group Prosperous America has written that industrial policy is “essential to rebuilding U.S. industry and prosperity.” [334] The logic is that industrial policy will boost output in industries with high value added per worker and by definition will reduce output in industries with lower value added per worker (this is an identity because the models and theory have to assume full employment). When a country is early in its development phase, as South Korea was in the 1950s, this moving-up-the-value-chain model can be quite effective. Workers move from lower productivity sectors such as agriculture and textiles to higher productivity sectors such as steel and then semiconductors. But once an economy becomes fully industrialized, the potential gains from such a strategy are quite limited. For example, the Bureau of Economic Analysis ranks the 19 major manufacturing industries by value added per worker, with petroleum and coal products at $836,600 per worker and furniture and related products at just $69,000. Assume that industrial policy boosts the higher value-added sector output and jobs by an average of 30 percent and reduces the lower value-added sector output and jobs by the same (so the economy has the same number of manufacturing jobs), GDP would experience a one-time increase of $230 billion, or about 1 percent of GDP. [335] Even if we assume that the losses are in even lower value-added nonmanufacturing sectors such as retail trade and personal services, the gains would still be quite small, perhaps 2 to 3 percent of GDP. Second, traditional industrial policy is indifferent to industries in terms of their importance to national power. If an industry has high value added (such as tobacco products), it’s a valuable industry, even if it has no impact on national power. In contrast, the goal of national power industry strategy is not to boost national income; it’s to preserve national power, even if that means a lower standard of living because consumers are paying more for products than they would in a world where more of these products were imported. In addition, national power industry strategy is not agnostic toward industry type. These distinctions may seem esoteric—after all, both approaches embrace industrial policy. But in fact, they are key. Adopting the former strategy will have some positive effects on national power industries, but much of those effects may be irrelevant. The latter strategy will focus on national power industries, even if consumers and taxpayers pay a price. Political economy is almost everything. To be sure, articulating the right strategic framing for a national power industry strategy is key. But at the end of the day, what matters is executing and implementing that strategy. For the most part, the USG is lacking implementation capabilities. There are too few people in government with deep understanding of technology, industry, and national industry strategy. And too many government programs are bogged down with too many rules and restrictions to make them fully effective. The characteristics of the U.S. political economy will have a major influence on the extent to which the United States can put in place an effective national power industry strategy. Even if, by miracle, a president were elected who placed the U.S.-China techno-economic war as their top priority and were fully committed to formulating and carrying out a national power industry strategy, the odds of its success would be limited unless there were broad political support for it, or at least the absence of vociferous opposition. With regard to the political economy of a national power industry strategy, the single biggest factor is that the United States no longer has a developmental state. A developmental state works to prioritize industrial and economic development, along with technological innovation, to strengthen a nation’s competitive standing and geopolitical power . In this model, the state plays an active role in fostering specific sectors and capabilities, in contrast to the more hands-off approach of neoliberalism or the more antibusiness, redistribution of neo-New Deal liberalism. We have a developmental state for defense, but nothing else. With regard to the political economy of a national power industry strategy, the single biggest factor is that the United States no longer has a developmental state. What we have is a fight between a capitalist class that wants nothing more than to be left alone and a Left that wants to limit them and redistribute wealth and power. The U.S. political economy is made up of at least five key players: business, labor unions, civil society, universities, and government. And within each group, there are key subgroups. Unfortunately, none of the five groups fully supports a national power industry strategy. Arguably the most incisive analysis of the role of corporations in U.S. economic policy is from U.C. Berkely political science professor David Vogel in his 1979 article “Why Businessmen Distrust Their State: The Political Consciousness of American Corporate Executives.” [336] While Vogel wrote this almost 50 years ago, little has changed. Vogel tried to answer why such a large share of U.S. corporate leaders looked askance at the state and wanted little to do with it, unlike corporate leaders in Europe and rising Asian nations. He wrote: The business community has been remarkably consistent in its opposition to the enactment of any government policies that would centralize economic decision making or strengthen the authority of government over the direction of the business system as a whole. It is only with respect to policies that have their impact on particular firm or industry that its much heralded pragmatism at times comes into play. The criterion by which business evaluates government policy has remained quite firm: does the proposed intervention strengthen or weaken the autonomy of management? [337] This was not, in Vogel’s view just some recent development; it was baked into the evolution of the U.S. economy. He wrote that this: was an element in conservative doctrine throughout the first seventy-five years of the Republic. After the Civil War, however, it became clear that capitalism was now strong enough to get along without more active assistance from government than it already enjoyed. Equally important, it began to appear that in a partnership between government and business the danger of gratuitous political interference was becoming too serious to justify the risk. The idea of a positive relationship between government and economic life thus fell out of favor among those who underwrote the conservative program. [338] It wasn’t that the state per se would be inept of anticorporate, it was that democratic forces, albeit stronger in the United States than in any other nation, would capture the state in ways that would harm business and overall economic development. Again, Vogel wrote, “Indeed, it was the fact that the state was not required to overthrow anticapitalist forces in the United States that leads to the unique view among U.S. business leaders.” Vogel went on: The critical key to understanding why businessmen are more anti-statist than virtually any other major interest in American society lies in the unique role of the state at their institution’s birth. Business—both large and small—developed during a period when the state was relatively weak and small: in the case of virtually all other major national institutions, the state and the political process played a critical role in their formation… Accepting their nation’s most powerful legitimating ideology, they remain concerned that governmental policy will indeed come to reflect popular preferences. Their hostility to both the ideal and the idea of government involvement in the economy is significantly due to their lack of confidence in their ability to dominate the political process. Unlike France, Germany and Japan, we have no tradition of a strong and autocratic state or of a bureaucracy independent of popular pressures. [339] He added: This historical development pattern, doesn’t just shape business leaders’ views toward business, it shapes their self-identity. For despite what Marxists might say, the United States does not have a unified, self-aware capitalist class, it has individual business leaders who see themselves as such for most interactions, every once in a while seeing them as part of a narrow industry, but almost never once as capitalists. [340] Vogel then wrote: The extent to which capitalism has been ideologically unchanged in America—either by an aristocracy or by a socialist working movement—has also inhibited American businessmen from developing a stronger sense of internal unity. A sense of classlessness that pervades American society, cited so frequently by both defenders and critics of America’s unique political tradition, not only made American unions relatively indifferent to socialist ideology; the individualistic ethic that is so critical a component of the liberal tradition also inhibits a sense of solidarity within the bourgeoisie. Nearly one hundred and fifty years ago, de Tocqueville remarked: To tell the truth, though there are rich men, the class of rich men does not exist; for these individuals have no feelings or purposes, no traditions or hopes, in common; there are individuals, therefore, but no definitive class... The rich are not compactly united among themselves.... In their intense and exclusive anxiety to make a fortune, they lose sight of the close connection which exists between the private fortune of each of them and the prosperity of all... The discharge of political duties appears to them to be a troublesome annoyance, which diverts them from their occupations and business ... These people think that they are following the principle of self-interest, but the idea they entertain of that principle is a very rude one; and the better to look after what they call their business, they neglect their chief business, which is to remain their own masters. [341] He quoted one business executive: “We don’t have a business community. Just a bunch of self-interested people.” 53 He further wrote, “American businessmen appear to behave quite rationally toward government when the interests of their firm or industry are at stake, yet their understanding of the American business system remains remarkably shortsighted and provincial: they confuse their role as businessmen with their interests as capitalists.” [342] This unfortunately has gotten worse, not better, since 1979. As Vogel pointed out, because of the nature of capitalist development in the United States, where the state did not have to play a strong role to overthrow feudal interests, U.S. business leaders never adopted a very strong role as “capitalists.” But even so, their understanding of that role and the key importance of it declined significantly after the late 1970s. Before then, many corporate leaders saw themselves as not only as business leaders but also as corporate statesmen. CEOs such as Reg Jones of General Electric, Irving Shapiro of Dupont, Thomas Watson of IBM, David Packard of HP, George Romney of American Motors, and even John Young of HP in the 1980s spent considerable time advancing the interests of the nation, not just their own firms. And unless you are a diehard anticorporate advocate, there is no doubt that this advocacy strengthened America. But that started to die in the late 1970s and 1980s, prompted by the shareholder value movement and the libertarian notions of popular economic figures such as Milton Friedman, who proclaimed that the only purpose of business is to maximize profits. At one level, this is, of course, true. Companies have to make profits, or they cannot stay in business. But if support for the capitalist system and the policies that support it are weakened, then the ability to earn individual profits is lessened. As Wall Street shifted from providing long-term capital for productive investment to a short-term extraction game—led by raiders such as Mike Miliken, Carl Icahn , Nelson Peltz , T. Boone Pickens , and others—CEOs could no longer afford anything but a focus on short-term profits. The capitalist system would have to take care of itself. And it has not. At the same time, corporate norms shifted and so what was once a system that enabled and largely required statesmanship was now one that penalized it. And the rise of intense global competition only contributed to that short-termism and selfish focus. Doug Henwood wrote that “the transaction replaced the relationship—not just on Wall Street but in American business generally.” [343] And it turns out that relationships are critical to the effective functioning and strength of the U.S. economy. At the same time, the decline of the traditional American WASP ruling class, with all its flaws, had the singular advantage of promoting leaders who were civic minded and not only self-interested, and played a key role. Say what you will about this class, it at least had an ethos of service to the nation. We saw this in the motto of private boarding school Groton, the lead training ground for American leadership class before the 1950s: “Cui servire est regnare,” which is conventionally translated as “To serve is to rule.” In other words, service was key. This didn’t mean that these leaders were always right or altruistic. It did mean that there was an expectation to serve and preserve the Republic. Today, WASPs are a timid minority that recognizes itself at its private clubs, but not much more. It’s not just the change in the system, it’s that the U.S. business community has not been able to generate its own leadership. Who are the top few business leaders who represent American business. Elon Musk? Tim Cook? Jamie Diamond? Not really. Even in 1979, Vogel dismissed the effectiveness of leading “peak associations” such as the Business Roundtable and the Council of Foreign Relations. He argued that the closest the capitalist class came to this was from the 1890s to 1920s, particularly with the leadership of Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan. Morgan was said to have told President Theordore Roosvelt during the Northern Securities antitrust case, “If we have done anything wrong, send your man to my man and they can fix it up” reflecting his centrality to U.S. business. [344] Vogel wrote that four factors weakened that: Since the 1920S four developments have markedly reduced the ability of corporate executives to generate their own political leadership: the decline of the dominance of the Morgan financial interests; the reduction in market control of many of the turn-of-the-century monopolies, e.g., Standard Oil, U.S. Steel, International Harvester; the displacement of entrepreneurs by professional managers; and the internationalization of U.S. corporations. The impact of the first two developments is obvious: they significantly decentralized authority within the corporate system, making it less likely that the position of any one firm could provide a point of departure for understanding the needs of business as a whole. Most of the voluminous literature on the separation of ownership and control is concerned with its impact on corporate economic behavior; what has been overlooked is its impact on corporate political consciousness. This is serious: the managerial revolution severely undermined the formation of corporate class consciousness and business solidarity. [345] Their class consciousness and solidarity are now almost completely gone. The state itself will have to have stronger capabilities, of course, deeply informed by industry, but willing to act for U.S. national power, even when business support might be lacking. At the same time, in part because of the overreach of the neoliberal vision (e.g., tax cuts for upper-income Americans and excessive globalization, reduced public investment, and an acceptance of what was once seen as a fringe ideology, libertarianism) what was once a Left that supported the American capitalist system but wanted it tamed and regulated to reduce excesses, is now largely antagonistic to the system. As an example, while Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) will proclaim that she’s pro capitalist, this appears to be mostly a smoke screen to defend her anticorporate positions. All this has two major implications for the development of a national power industry strategy. First, it means that companies, even if they realize the nature of the China challenge, will be hesitant about asking for state help because they do not trust the ability of the state to either not get captured by nonbusiness interests or to effectively implement a developmental program. Such concerns are not unwarranted, as we saw with the politicization of the CHIPS program by the Biden administration and now the Trump administration. But there are policies and program designs that can limit such flaws, such as tax incentives and industry-led programs. Second, it means that there are few voices advancing the overall U.S. business interests, especially as they align with state interests. Few companies have the leeway to think much beyond their own firm’s interests—especially their near-term interests. This is not because the leadership is populated with selfish individuals. It is because they are operating in a financialized capitalist system wherein any behavior other than that will be punished by markets. As such, it means that the state itself will have to have stronger capabilities, of course deeply informed by industry, but willing to act for U.S. national power, even when business support might be lacking. Box 7: From Shareholder Value Capitalism to National Power Capitalism The emergence of the shareholder value movement—the notion that the sole purpose of capitalist enterprises is to maximize profits—is often attributed to a 1970 New York Times Magazine article by economist Milton Friedman, who wrote that the purpose of a business “is to increase its profits.” [346] Radical libertarian Friedman saw anything other than extreme selfishness as socialism: This is the basic reason why the doctrine of “social responsibility” involves the acceptance of the socialist view that political mechanisms, not market mechanisms, are the appropriate way to determine the allocation of scarce resources to alternative uses. [347] Today, the shareholder value movement tolerates no other corporate purpose than producing short-term profits. Yet, from the early 1900s until the 1970s, there was a general view held by corporations that their mission was not just to increase stock price but also to serve other constituencies, including the national interests (something libertarians such as Friedman do not believe exists). Eminent business scholar Peter F. Drucker represented this view in 1952, writing: We believe today, both inside and outside the business world, that the business enterprise, especially the large business enterprise, exists for the sake of the contribution which it makes to the welfare of society as a whole. Our economic-policy discussions are all about what this responsibility involves and how best it can be discharged. There is, in fact, no disagreement, except on the lunatic fringes of the Right and on the Left, that business enterprise is responsible for the optimum utilization of that part of society's always-limited productive resources which are under the control of the enterprise. [348] But beginning in the 1980s, changes in the institutional system of U.S. investing and management, under the rubric of the “shareholder value movement,” changed all that. How investment funds were structured and their managers were rewarded meant that funds moved money around in search of the quickest return, regardless of where long-term value might be found. How managers were compensated—increasingly with stock options that were not always related to actual managerial performance—reflected this new view that a manager’s job was to maximize value for the shareholders. And because managers themselves became key short-term stockholders (through the significant growth of stock options), they made even more effort to enhance the welfare of short-term stockholders, including by boosting dividends and through stock buybacks. Now stock price was all that mattered, and the best way to get that price up was to engage in frenetic bidding wars to get the best CEO and top-level management team, which meant a massive increase in executive compensation. The rise of the shareholder value movement and its later evolution into corporate short-termism, or what some call “quarterly capitalism,” meant that CEOs were rewarded for downsizing firms, limiting investment in capital stock (in order to maximize return on net assets), and paying attention solely to the bottom line. This focus on short-term returns was not rational in the sense of maximizing returns for society, or even for companies (if returns are defined as maximizing the net present value of all future profits). The shareholder value revolution hurt national economic power. Indeed, as companies began paying out more in dividends and engaging in stock buybacks as a way to boost stock prices for short-term investors, relatively less was available for investing in activities that would boost national economic power. With the rise of the shareholder value movement came a shift in the political role and orientation of the corporate community. Prior to the mid-1980s, many CEOs, such as GM’s Charlie Wilson, GE’s Reginald Jones, HP’s John Young, DuPont’s Irving Shapiro, and Loral’s Bernard Schwartz, saw their role not just as CEO but as corporate statesman. But around that time, the role of “business statesman” began to fade. Executives came under increasing pressure to focus ruthlessly on boosting profits and share prices. Those who didn’t risked losing their jobs or seeing their companies swallowed up in hostile takeovers. This is not to say that some of today’s CEOs don’t try to play some broader role, but overall, U.S. corporate leaders have abdicated their roles as statesmen for roles as CEOs alone. In his book, The Fracturing of the Corporate Elite , Mark Mizruchi observed: [After] World War II, American business leaders hewed to an ethic of civic responsibility and enlightened self-interest.… In the 1970s, however, faced with inflation, foreign competition, and growing public criticism, corporate leaders became increasingly confrontational with labor and government. As they succeeded in taming their opponents, business leaders paradoxically undermined their ability to act collectively. [349] A survey by the corporate organization Committee for Economic Development supports this observation, finding that the three biggest barriers to business leaders taking a more active role in public issues were “concern about criticism others have experienced; shareholder pressure for short-term results; and belief that a CEO should focus on his/her company.” [350] For the CEOs, it became a collective action problem. Why step up and fight for big business and the U.S. economy generally when it only means taking valuable time away from your company? As a thought experiment, try to name a current CEO who is seen as a leader for good policy for the American economy. Today, the lunatic fringes of the Right and Left are no longer fringes. The Right embraces Friedman’s shareholder value movement. Today’s Left, at best, talks about stakeholder capitalism (e.g., helping workers, the environment, and other interests). Some, such as radical globalist Klaus Scwab, even argue that the key stakeholder should be the entire global proletariat and environment. [351] Others, including many on the progressive Left, would have companies completely do away with a focus on profits, while others would wrap corporations up in a Gulliver-like straitjacket. [352] But even mainstream thinking has missed the point. The Business Roundtable says that the best companies “put the customer first and invest in their employees and communities” and supporting their suppliers. [353] For many, shareholder capitalism is following an alphabet soup of ESG (environment, social, and governance) goals. Absent is any discussion of the needs of the nation as a whole. What is needed is an alternative to shareholder capitalism that is not stakeholder capitalism. We need national power capitalism. In this framework, companies don’t ignore profit, but they work wherever possible to align that with U.S. and allied techno-economic and trade power. And they certainly do not oppose, and ideally support, national government policies to encourage the alignment of companies and the national interest. Just as corporations used to think of themselves as defenders of the system, so did organized labor. Of course, this was before labor unions were significantly weakened and now largely represent government workers, some low-pay service workers, and certain construction trades. Like corporations, unions focus largely on their own interests, in this case, demanding higher wages and benefits and resisting automation. A 2023 United Auto Workers strike led the Big Three U.S. automakers to grant workers at least 27 percent wage increases. [354] The Writers Guild strike resulted in studios agreeing to limit the use of AI to automate creative work. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace struck for a 40 percent wage increase and a restoration of defined-benefit retirement plans. The question few are asking is what the effect will be on the global competitiveness of these companies, and by extension the U.S. economy. It’s one thing for a teachers’ union to demand higher wages; the only result would be higher taxes. But in industries that are globally traded, overly aggressive union demands often put firms at a competitive disadvantage—helping current union members in the short term, but hurting the firms, future workers, and the national economy in the long term as the firms become less competitive in global markets. We have the role of unions in leading to industrial decline in the United Kingdom, as all their incentives have been to maximize short-term gains at the expense of long-term stability. Even if unions realized the harm they were doing to their firms, all too often, they haven’t been able to stop themselves. As one scholar wrote with regard to U.K. unions: What occurred in industry after industry in the U.K. was a Greek tragedy.… Somehow workers in some sectors have found themselves destroying their firm, fully aware of what they were doing, yet unable to stop. They found themselves answering strike calls … in the full awareness that … the result could only be ruin for all concerned. [355] That description bears a striking resemblance to what has also occurred in many unionized U.S. industries. Around 2015, I asked a former UAW leader whether, if the UAW had known in the 1970s and 1980s what it knows now about the decline of the Big Three, it would have done things differently. His response was, “No.” While he acknowledged that UAW actions hurt the Big Three’s global market share, he believed that union leadership could have acted no differently. If it had, he said, workers would have voted UAW leadership out and installed leaders who would stand up for the interests of workers now. Moreover, while some in the AFL-CIO have called for more industrial policy support, the lion’s share of its efforts to go boosting wages and expanding members. [356] On its web page “What We Care About,” the Federation lists better pay and benefits, civil rights, corporate greed, gender equality, global worker rights, immigration, infrastructure, and workplace health and safety. [357] Lower on the page, on a list of other issues, it does list manufacturing. As Vogel has rightly pointed out, institutionalized civil society after the New Deal accepted and even supported the corporate capitalist system. They just wanted to ensure that broader societal interests were adequately represented, and their concerns addressed. That is no longer the case. Most of these groups, largely funded by major left-wing foundations, now reject the U.S. capitalist system, seeing it as inherently evil and harmful. It is racist, sexist, imperialist, and every other “ist.” Hundreds of these often-well-funded groups push for ever stronger land use and environmental regulations, stronger privacy rules, stronger antitrust prosecution, higher business taxes, and technology bans. The philanthropy consultancy, Blue Tent, has identified over 200 left-leaning foundations in America. [358] These include groups that reject copyright enforcement, seek to hold tech firms “accountable,” promote technology justice, protect individual privacy, oppose new technologies such as facial recognition and AI, highlight “power imbalances,” and want to break-up large firms and regulate large telecom providers to bridge various digital divides. The Ford Foundation alone has funded nearly 100 nonprofit advocacy groups focused on “public interest technology.” [359] Not one comes close to supporting a national power industry strategy. Most of these groups, largely funded by major left-wing foundations, now reject the U.S. capitalist system, seeing it as inherently evil and harmful. At the same time, most free-market foundations fund organizations that are diametrically opposed to the government development of a national power industry strategy because their task is less government. While that can be an important component of a national power industry strategy, if it focuses on eliminating or streamlining regulations inimical to national power industry competitiveness, overall, they oppose the areas where government needs to be more active and strategic. In addition, a variety of nonprofits now mobilize political interests to not only prevent any reforms needed to better compete with China, but also to rachet up new regulatory restrictions. We see this with the pressure environmental organizations exert any time Congress attempts even the most common-sense reform of environmental laws. A national power industry strategy would entail a very different role for U.S. research universities. They would, among other things, need to focus more on STEM education, especially for Americans; on research areas critical to success in national power industries; and on working more closely with industry to ensure that more of the benefits of that research flow to firms in America, rather than China. But the problem is that U.S. universities resist the imposition of even guidance from the federal government. As Vogel argued that U.S. business executives value autonomy from government above all else, the same is true with faculty, who ultimately call the shots at universities. We have seen this with the reaction to President Trump’s “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education,” which would provide universities with a set of benefits if they adopt the measures in the Compact. The point here is not whether the Compact is good, or if the president has the authority to implement it; it’s to show the utter focus on autonomy by higher education. For example, in rejecting the invitation to join, Brown University’s president, Christina Paxson, said that the compact “by its nature and by various provisions would restrict academic freedom and undermine the autonomy of Brown’s governance.” [360] Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), stated: By declining to compromise its core mission, Brown University has affirmed that no amount of federal inducement is worth surrendering the freedom to question, explore and dissent. In rejecting the compact, Brown stands as a bulwark for higher education’s sacred commitment to academic freedom and institutional self-governance. [361] To be sure, they would be mostly correct if they were not receiving funding from taxpayers through federal grants. If they want to give up that, then have at it. But the acceptance of federal funding should come with it an expectation to act in the national interest, not just the university’s own interest, however it defines it. Academic freedom is a code word for being able to say and do whatever they want with virtually no constraints. But with the national industry power war, it is in the national interest for universities to operate differently. This means boosting the quality of undergraduate education from its fairly mediocre levels. Keeping tuition increases reasonable so students can afford education without federal subsidies. Focusing more on STEM education, especially for American students. And focusing on research critical to the success of national power industries. With the national industry power war, it is in the national interest for universities to operate differently. However, as we saw with the vociferous resistance by higher education to the provisions in the Endless Frontier Act (which was incorporated with the CHIPS Act to become the Chips and Science Act) that would have given most of the increase in National Science Foundation funding to the Technology Innovation Partnerships program rather than to traditional programs, we can expect most higher education institutions to actively resist ensuring that higher ed policy be guided by a national advanced industry strategy. They will continue to trot out stale bromides such as academic freedom and Vannevar Bush’s linear model of science that lets researchers study whatever they want and only focus on research publications. Universities that agree to support U.S. national power industries would likely be attacked by their fellow universities and academics. Finally, government. The state itself is an actor advancing interests: something the MAGA right calls the “deep state,” implying that government interests are not national interests. Notwithstanding this radical view, the U.S. state itself is actually weak. Vogel nailed it when he wrote, “The American state still lacks essential information about the basic functioning of the economy and even if that information were available the fragmentation of authority and power within the federal bureaucracy would make any coordinated government policy extremely problematic.” [362] Given the hollowing out of the federal government since he wrote this in 1979, including the recent calamity of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) haphazardly slashing and burning bureaucracy, this is even more true now. [363] To the extent that the state has real capacity, it is largely limited to DOD, and as discussed in later work on policy steps, the problem is that DOD (or now called the Department of War) has become another interest group, focusing on advancing its own narrow military interests rather than national power writ large, especially through a national power industry strategy. In writing about how corporations have to succeed, Gary Hamel and Prahalad stated: To create the future, an entire company, not just a few isolated boffins or ”research fellows” must possess industry foresight. Top management cannot abdicate its responsibility for developing, articulating and sharing a point of view about the future. What is needed are not just skunk works and intrapreneurs, but senior managers who can escape the orthodoxies of the corporation’s current “concept of self.” [364] DOD has become another interest group, focusing on advancing its own narrow military interests rather than national power writ large, especially through a national power industry strategy. They went on to write: Making industry and company conventions explicit, understanding how these conventions could imperil the firm’s success in the future, delving deeply into industry discontinuities, establishing a process for extending industry foresight and working collectively to craft a strategic architecture are the means for genetic reengineering on a large scale. [365] That is all the more true for the USG. But today’s few SES (Senior Executive Service) or political appointees have those capabilities, and as discussed later, there are few easy ways by which they can attain them. When David Vogel wrote his book, majorities in both parties accepted both government and corporate capitalism. The Republicans were always a bit more on the side of corporations. The Democrats were on the side of civil society and used the state to advanced broader public interests and concerns, especially workers’ and consumers’. Now most of the Right wants significantly limited government and some no longer trust corporate America. And much of the Left has rejected large corporations and the capitalist system itself. Vogel noted how the U.S. democratic system, with its open democracy, was one of the few developed economies without a socialist opposition: Whatever may be inconveniences of a relatively open and responsive governmental system to the achievement of specific corporate objectives—and they are often considerable - they are clearly the price the American bourgeoisie pays for a luxury enjoyed by no other business community in the advanced capitalist nations—the absence of a socialist opposition. American executives continually complain about the large number of organizations and interest groups that routinely turn to the state to redress their grievances against the corporation, but this state of affairs certainly preferable to one in which these non or antibusiness factions did not use the political process because they perceived it as fixed against them. The latter would seriously undermine the political stability upon which a sound economic system depends. [366] That is no longer the case. A large swath of progressives now embrace socialism, even if they do not call it that. And it is quite possible that America will become like Europe: a social welfare state wherein socialism represents the Left. Given that any effective national power industry strategy has to be built around large corporations and a strong government role, all this bodes ill for the ability to take effective action. For conservatives, it’s just as bad, if not worse. For much of the post New-Deal through to the election of President Reagan, the business community, and more important conservative intellectuals accepted the New Deal. As Vogel wrote: At his presidential address delivered to the annual meeting of the American Economic Association in 1962, Edward S. Mason noted …the fact that the really revolutionary changes in the role of government and in the relation of various groups to government produced by the depression and the war have not yet been fully accepted in this country. Where counter-revolution is still considered to be a possibility no one is quite prepared to lay down his arms. [367] Dwight Eisenhower warned that abolishing New Deal programs would undermine any political party’s viability, and for decades, Republicans largely grudgingly heeded that caution. Even though many on the Right have long viewed Wilson’s New Freedom, Roosevelt’s New Deal, and Johnson’s Great Society as fundamental deviations from America’s founding principles, conservative politicians, like liberals, have dared not touch them. The policies and programs of those eras were assumed to be sacrosanct pillars of the post-World War II power and prosperity we have known as the American Century. But the counterrevolution was always nascent, occasionally breaking out with someone like Goldwater or Gingrich. Now the counterrevolution has triumphed, working to restore the nation to the pre-New Deal, and even pre-Wilson era. [368] President Trump and the MAGA movement, buoyed by a perception of the Biden administration’s overreach, are now actively revolting against all that was once held sacred. Many are doing so under the banner of “drain the swamp.” More fundamentally, though, the animating desire is to return to the governance of more than a century ago—that of the Gilded Age, an era of small government, protective tariffs, limited immigration, and America as regional power—a period that reached its zenith during the Republican administration of President William McKinley. Given that any effective national power industry strategy has to be built around large corporations and a strong government role, all this bodes ill for the ability to take effective action. Ironically, the business community in the United States distrusts the state because it worries that it will be captured by populist forces that neither understand nor care about the economic system—and even more ominously, they will try to dismantle that system. With such a risk always in the background, U.S. corporate leaders have long preferred to be left alone, and to support a weak central government. If America is to not lose the national power industry war to China, it needs a political economy that puts the restoration of U.S. power, especially from national power industries, at the center. It is ironic that in a Marxist-Leninist China, the last thing the state wants is for democratic forces to derail capitalist progress. To be sure, the CCP inserts itself into capitalists’ business, but it is only to 1) make sure that the capitalists do not challenge the Party and 2) to make sure that the companies advance CCP and Chinese power globally. If America is to not lose the national power industry war to China, it needs a political economy that puts the restoration of U.S. power, especially from national power industries, at the center. Until recently, China’s playbook was to imitate the advances of industrialized countries, but since the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011–2015), the Chinese government has shifted its strategy toward incentivizing innovation. We see that in a variety of advanced sectors. China has named biotechnology as a strategic emerging industry and has set development priorities for drugs, biomedical engineering, agriculture, and biomanufacturing. It has developed a comprehensive national strategy to enhance the innovation capabilities of its domestic biotech industry. The strategy includes subsidies, financial incentives, national reimbursement for innovative therapies; the creation of high-tech science parks, start-up incubators, and public-private partnerships; talent recruitment initiatives; reforms to expedite drug review, especially for domestic products; and efforts to enhance IP protection to foster innovation. China has set several milestones and goals for the industry, including enhancing the originality of biotech through new technologies and products, creating a biotech innovation platform, and strengthening the industrialization of biotechnology. To implement this strategy, China has increased R&D activity and built out its innovation infrastructure—science parks, incubators, and national gene and cell banks. The number of high-quality biotech publications and clinical trials in China has surged. Still, structural challenges remain, such as inconsistent hospital data systems and difficulty translating scientific research into market-ready products, with China lagging behind the United States in commercialization capabilities. However, it is expected that the Chinese share of the global biotech drug market will grow significantly, at the cost of Western leaders’ market share. China’s quantum strategy reflects a clear belief that competing in this field requires central political control, not just industrial strength. Rather than backing a decentralized commercial ecosystem like in the United States, Beijing has placed universities and state-run labs at the center of its quantum push, with funding, talent, and political oversight all flowing through the Party apparatus. The focus is on the areas where state coordination can yield strategic wins—namely, quantum communications and sensing, which are easier to deploy and carry direct national security value. To implement this strategy, the government has folded private industry into its preferred channels. High-profile exits, such as Alibaba and Baidu abandoning their quantum research divisions and transferring their assets to state-linked institutions, reflect a system wherein firms are discouraged from independent leadership and instead are expected to serve as suppliers or technical partners to state-led projects. Rather than bet on uncertain, long-term breakthroughs in quantum computing, China is locking in an early advantage in quantum key distribution (QKD) and quantum sensors, which are more mature fields that can scale faster and shape international norms. For the United States, the impact is dual. First, China’s rapid progress in quantum communications and sensing shortens the window for U.S. institutions to upgrade to post-quantum secure systems. That raises national security risks; if adversaries establish quantum-secure channels or advance quantum sensing before the United States adapts, it could compromise intelligence, defense, and critical infrastructure. Second, China’s early dominance in export-ready quantum systems, especially sensing technologies, threatens U.S. competitiveness in emerging markets. By offering heavily subsidized AI solutions through state-directed firms, China could lock in long-term customers and establish its standards as the default, making it harder for U.S. companies to enter or influence these strategic sectors later on. China is using state power to tilt the AI playing field. Rather than relying on market dynamics alone, China is using state-led tools—subsidies, open-source acceleration, massive data access, and political endorsement—to build national champions and crowd out foreign competitors. Tsinghua-affiliated start-ups such as Zhipu AI and Moonshot AI, backed by government-linked funding and supercomputing access, show how China incubates AI firms within a politically protected ecosystem. These firms now produce competitive large language models, and some, such as DeepSeek, outperform U.S. peers on key benchmarks. China implements this strategy by tightly aligning AI firms’ development with state priorities. The government funnels capital through targeted venture funding, particularly benefiting companies overlooked by private markets, and supports strategic partnerships that quickly scale AI platforms. Firms such as DeepSeek receive explicit political endorsement, securing privileged market positions and accelerating their ability to innovate and commercialize. Furthermore, China leverages its enormous population to generate extensive, unrestricted datasets, feeding AI models at a scale unattainable in democratic societies constrained by privacy rules. This creates a structural advantage, allowing Chinese firms to train advanced AI systems more cost-effectively and rapidly. If China’s model for AI becomes the reference point in fast-growing markets, U.S. firms may find themselves shut out of both standards-setting processes and adoption pathways. This doesn’t mean replicating China’s model, but it does mean recognizing the structural advantages it creates and rethinking the domestic policies that may be holding U.S. companies back. China has pursued an ambitious strategy to become the world’s leading EV and battery manufacturer and, in so doing, displace “Western” (including Japan and South Korea) leadership in internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. The Chinese government began investing in EV-related technologies as early as 2001, when EV technology was introduced as a priority science research project in China’s 10th Five-Year Plan. Subsidies have proven indispensable in building Chinese EV competitiveness. From 2009 to 2023 alone, China channeled $230.9 billion in subsidies and other support to its domestic EV sector. From 2018 to 2023, the Chinese government extended $1.8 billion in subsidies to EV battery developer CATL (Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited) alone. Chinese policymakers have put their thumb on the scale for electric as opposed to ICE vehicle adoption, such as by giving EV owners license plates at no cost and not subjecting them to traffic control measures. China has established the world’s largest public charging infrastructure network. Growth in Chinese competitiveness in autos has been astounding. In 1985, Chinese enterprises manufactured a grand total of 5,200 passenger vehicles; by 2024, they produced 26.8 million vehicles (including 10 million EVs)—21 percent of global production—a share automotive analysts expect will reach one-third by 2030. The Alliance for Automotive Manufacturing has referred to Chinese EV growth as a potential “extinction-level event.” While Chinese EV makers have yet to make significant inroads in the U.S. market, they’re capturing considerable market share in third-market countries. The United States has responded by offering 100 percent tariffs on Chinese EV imports. Ever since the 2013 Third Party Plenum, the Chinese government has made semiconductors the country’s top industrial innovation priority. China’s “2014 National Guidelines for Development and Promotion of the Integrated Circuit Industry” called for $150 billion in central government investments to establish a fully “closed-loop” semiconductor ecosystem in China. The plan called for eliminating China’s trade deficit in ICs by 2030 and achieving 70 percent self-sufficiency in semiconductors by that year. Chris Miller has suggested that adding up semiconductor-sector investments made by Chinese governments at all levels, China “has probably invested the equivalent of [America’s] CHIPS Act virtually every year since 2014.” [369] One OECD study of the global semiconductor industry from 2014–2018 found that China accounted for 86 percent of all below-market equity injections and that subsidies accounted for 40 percent of foundry SMIC’s revenues. The Chinese government stood up NAND memory-maker YMTC from whole cloth by a $24 billion investment. China added more chip-making capacity than the rest of the world combined in 2024, with most centered in the legacy (28 nm or greater) market, which is particularly concerning because Chinese companies are gaining a foothold there and selling products 20–30 percent less than Western competitors, disrupting the industry’s innovation economics. Huawei Ascend AI and Kirin mobile chips are increasingly capable and pose market share threats to U.S. companies in China and third-party markets. Elsewhere, Document 79 articulates an import substitution approach that has directed Chinese EV and ICT firms to remove foreign semiconductors from their products. The final report in this Chinese National Power Industry War series will be a comprehensive and detailed policy agenda. But as a way to frame that, based on the argument presented here, this appendix briefly describes major changes needed in various policy areas. For the free-market Right, the goal of antitrust is short-term consumer welfare; and for the populist Left and Right, the goal is attacking and breaking up big companies. It is time to incorporate a national power industry “screen” in antitrust analysis and enforcement wherein national power industries would be treated differently. Merger review, as well as enforcement, would be viewed in equal part of how much the actions would hurt U.S. power industry capabilities. U.S. environmental regulation came of age in an era of supposed plenty with virtually no international industry competition. And over the years, it was largely a one-way ratchet, with more regulation added on. Some regulation makes sense. But much of it could be implemented in ways that are less damaging to competitiveness and with lower compliance costs. And some are just unnecessary. The poster child of this is the National Environmental Protection Act, which imposes massive costs and delays, or even bans, on needed development. Again, as with antitrust, environmental regulation needs to reformed and implemented through the “screen” of national power industry health. Industry is regulated in a number of ways besides environmental regulation. This includes sector-specific regulation (e.g., freight rail, housing construction, etc.), data privacy regulation, worker safety, and others. Again, as with environmental regulation, these were put in place and enforced with little consideration for impact on national power industry competitiveness. That needs to change. For most Republicans (and neoclassical economists), the best business tax code is a broad base (few to no exemptions of incentives and a low rate). For most Democrats, the best business tax code is one that raises the effective tax rate of large corporations. A national power industry-based tax code reduces the effective rate on business, but especially on national power industries, by boosting specific incentives to align their interests with national interests for a strong national power industry sector. Both parties are afraid of the wrath of selfish American voters of raising taxes on anyone but the rich. And most Republicans favor cutting USG discretionary spending, including on activities that would support U.S. national power industry competitiveness. Most Democrats want to boost spending to help current consumers and workers, even if this means less public investment that would support power industries. And both parties are terrified of controlling entitlement spending, even though without that, there is almost no way to generate the fiscal headroom for the kinds of direct and indirect (tax) expenditures needed to win the national power industry war with China. Most in Washington are loathe to prioritize particular industries in trade policy—""agriculture is as important as aerospace.” That needs to change, where the interests of U.S. national power industries are paramount on trade policy and negotiations may require comprising with other nations in ways that hurt nonpower industries while helping U.S. power industries. At the same time, traditional trade supporters see free trade with all nations as good, and populist trade advocates on both the Right and the Left now reject global trade and seek autocracy; sometimes euphemistically called a “trade agenda for the middle class.” A national power industry trade agenda prioritizes China, including strengthening allied trade relations and allied efforts to restrict Chinese exports, especially of power industry goods and services. U.S. foreign policy on the right prioritizes the United States being the policeman throughout the world. On the Left, it prioritizes pushing for human rights throughout the world, including in China. In addition, foreign policy has long been willing to spend “national power industry capital” to achieve these globalist foreign policy goals. We see this in how the United States has consistently engaged in export controls to punish nations for taking actions we didn’t like, even though that came at the cost of U.S. power industry competitiveness. A national power industry foreign policy prioritizes China over all else, and seeks to advance U.S. national power interests throughout the world. Since the start of the first Cold War, U.S. policy has idolatrized small business, blessing it with a wide panoply of regulatory, tax, and spending protections and favors. The Left supports it because it believes that it can convince petit-bourgeois small business owners to think of themselves as part of the proletariat oppressed by large capitalist corporations. The Right supports them because they see them as being driven by Adam Smith-like competition, unlike large supposedly woke, crony capitalist large corporations. In a world of national power industry war with China, the nation can longer afford to do this. It costs too much money, and it weakens power industry firms. In a power industry world, all U.S. policy would become size neutral. Banking and investment regulation has largely supported financial markets, even though many of them have become zero-sum casinos benefiting a small cadre of billionaire hedge fund managers, driving national power industry corporations toward short-term financial maximization at the cost of long-term competitiveness. Investment regulation needs to focus first on how to drastically reduce the size of the industry as it sucks off needed talent and GDP away from national power industries. Second, it needs to reform the industry away from its parasitic short-termism toward long-term national wealth and power creation. Science policy still is under the post-WWII shadow of Vannevar Bush and the linear model of science focused on prioritizing early-stage basic science of whatever scientists want to study. Science policy should evolve to “science, technology, and engineering” policy and more money should go to targeted areas critical to advancing U.S. national power industries and in ways that involve industry more. Whether that can be done at the National Science Foundation with its deep commitment to the desires of individual scientists and research universities, or whether it requires the creation of separate institution is an open question. There is a reason the United States has no real national power industry strategy and why so few policy areas are aligned to support that. And it is because there are few forces in American politics pushing for this. Most Republicans, including most “Trumpians,” still are committed to small government and “freedom” from government. That is largely what the president wants. And most Democrats now are firmly redistributionists, wanting more now, especially for those “oppressed” by the U.S. capitalist system and big corporations. That is largely what President Biden pushed for. Not losing the national power industry war with China requires more state capacity and action, strong support for power industry corporations, and way more sacrifice of current consumption toward future investment. As Robert Kagan of the Brookings Institution put it: If and when American power declines, the institutions and norms that American power has supported will decline, too. Or more likely, if history is a guide, they may collapse altogether as we make a transition to another kind of world order, or to disorder. We may discover then that the U.S. was essential to keeping the present world order together and that the alternative to American power was not peace and harmony but chaos and catastrophe—which is what the world looked like right before the American order came into being.

To protect U.S. economic strength and national security , policymakers must jettison old techno-economic and trade policy doctrines and adopt a new national power industry strategy .

[ 1 ] That is why the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation ( ITIF ) established the Hamilton Center on Industrial Strategy . [ 2 ] It is dedicated to advancing a comprehensive framework and specific policy agenda to maintain America ’ s competitive edge . [ 3 ] With America now facing an aggressive and often malign challenge from China , there is an urgent need for stronger policy advocacy and thought leadership that articulates the case for robust national strategic-industry policy . [ 4 ] This policy must focus on critical , dual-use technologies and industries in advanced , traded sectors of the economy . Such an approach requires firmly rebutting the deeply held view of most economists and many policymakers that all industries are created equal . In other words , no more “ potato chips , computer chips—what ’ s the difference ? ” Strategic-industry policy demands making tough political choices and “ picking winners ” —not individual firms or specific technologies , but rather certain industries and categories of technology that are critical to the nation ’ s future . Finally , it requires a government that is knowledgeable and sophisticated about industry operations and the effects of policy on traded sectors . [ 5 ] Under the Hamilton Center , ITIF has launched a major research project focusing on China ’ s industrial goals and strategies , their impact on U.S. industrial power , how U.S. policymakers and experts should think about this challenge , and what a detailed and comprehensive policy agenda should look like . The project ’ s core thesis is that a specific set of industries acts as a vital wellspring of national power , either because they directly support the defense industrial base or because they limit dependence on U.S. adversaries that could be used for coercion . ITIF calls them “ national power industries. ” Without major structural change in U.S. policy—akin to the strategy America implemented at the beginning of the Cold War—we believe that the United States ’ national power industries will weaken significantly , if not die , in turn weakening the U.S. defense industrial base and giving China techno-economic leverage over America in a broad range of areas , not just rare earth minerals . At its core , this challenge requires formulating and implementing a national power industry strategy grounded not just in economics but also in corporate strategy literature . This project focuses on several objectives . First , this report provides an overarching analytical framework and an enumeration of the stakes , including an assessment of the Chinese Communist Party ’ s ( CCP ’ s ) intent . It then proposes the concept of national power industries , classifying U.S. industries into four categories of relative importance to the power industry competition . The report examines why current techno-economic and trade policy doctrines that dominate Washington , DC , are flawed and misguided , then summarizes 18 different strategic directions offered by conventional foreign policy thinking and explains why these approaches are inadequate . Following this analysis , the report draws on corporate strategy literature to outline what a coherent and effective grand strategy for the national power industry competition should look like . Finally , it examines the political economy of implementing such a strategy . After this report , the project will conduct a series of quantitative and qualitative analyses examining the past and present performance of U.S. power industries , including comparisons to China . This analysis will examine impacts on the overall U.S. economy , the 50 states , and the competition between China and the United States for global market share in national power industries . Finally , the project will outline a comprehensive agenda for U.S. industrial policy that can be implemented by Congress and the administration . This will include both specific policies and recommendations for reorganizing government . The United States faces an existential challenge in China ’ s systematic campaign to dominate the advanced industries that enable national power in the 21st century . Unlike any competitor in American history , China combines the continental scale of a 1.4-billion-person economy with a Marxist-Leninist political system explicitly committed to achieving techno-economic supremacy over the Western democratic world . This is not normal economic competition between market economies—it is a carefully orchestrated , multi-decade strategic campaign to displace U.S. industrial capabilities , weaken allied nations , and fundamentally reshape the global order under CCP leadership . The stakes transcend economics . National power today depends on strength in what this report terms “ national power industries ” —a spectrum of sectors spanning pure defense production , dual-use technologies employed in both military and commercial applications , and enabling industries that support the broader industrial commons . These include semiconductors , aerospace , biopharmaceuticals , telecommunications equipment , advanced chemicals , precision machinery , robotics , artificial intelligence ( AI ) systems , and dozens of other sectors in which weakened or fatally injured firms would grant China dangerous leverage over the United States and its allies , as well as weaken U.S. defense production capabilities . On its current trajectory , it is likely that China will soon amass significantly greater capabilities than the United States will in national power industries . This competition occurs against a backdrop of American policy failure . For over two decades , U.S. leaders across both parties have operated under the assumption that China was becoming a “ normal ” market economy that would gradually liberalize politically and economically . That assumption has proven catastrophically wrong . China today is more authoritarian , more aggressive internationally , and more committed to state-directed capitalism than at any point since Mao ’ s death . On its current trajectory , it is likely that China will soon amass significantly greater capabilities than the United States will in national power industries . With those greater capabilities will come geostrategic hegemony over the West , unless the United States forestalls that outcome by adopting a new , transformative national power industry strategy that goes beyond a mere competitiveness or national innovation strategy . This is not a war that the United States and allies can win in the sense of significantly weakening or retarding the growth of China ’ s own national power industries . The only way Chinese attacks will end is if China becomes a free , democratic country . But the United States and allies can avoid defeat—keeping their national power industries relatively strong—by working together and adopting national power industry strategies . Perhaps the most damning evidence of Chinese intentions comes from internal Communist Party documents and speeches intended for party members rather than foreign audiences . As China scholar Daniel Tobin has documented , these reveal a regime explicitly committed to Marxist-Leninist global ambitions that go far beyond merely moving up the value chain and growing its economy . Xi Jinping has repeatedly framed China ’ s rise in ideological terms , stating that “ scientific socialism is full of vitality in 21st century China ” and that China offers “ a new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence. ” In a 2013 speech to senior party officials , Xi declared that “ the viewpoint of historical materialism that capitalism is doomed to failure and socialism will prevail ” remains valid , and that China must “ seize the initiative , win the competitive edge , and secure our future ” in a “ long-term cooperation and rivalry between the two social systems. ” Documents from the party ’ s 20th Congress state that China ’ s success has “ significantly shifted the worldwide historical evolution of the contest between the two different ideologies and social systems of socialism and capitalism in a way that favors socialism. ” Chinese leaders explicitly describe their work as part of a “ great struggle ” and “ systems contest with Western capitalist democracy , ” using terminology that leaves no ambiguity about their intentions . On technology and industry specifically , party documents are equally explicit . The minister of Science and Technology wrote in the People ’ s Daily that “ the scientific and technological revolution and the contest between major powers are intertwined ; the high-tech field has become the forefront and main battlefield of international competition. ” Another official commentary stated : “ To a certain extent , those who gain access to the Internet will gain the world . Core technology is an important weapon for the country. ” China ’ s Made in China 2025 plan , while officially downplayed after international backlash , clearly articulates the goal : “ Building an internationally competitive manufacturing industry is the only way China can enhance its comprehensive national strength , ensure national security , and build itself into a world power. ” The plan calls for China to “ seize the commanding heights of a new round of competition in the manufacturing industry ” and achieve innovation leadership “ ranking first globally. ” The CCP follows a predictable playbook across industry after industry . Leading Chinese scholar Lu Yongxiang stated in 2024 that “ by 2035 , ‘ Made in China ’ will surpass the United States and become the global leader , ” noting this would thrust the world into a “ new era ” —explicitly referencing an era of Chinese dominance . These are not the words of a nation seeking merely to “ catch up ” or achieve “ legitimate development. ” They are the explicit articulation of a campaign for global advanced industrial hegemony . China ’ s actions match its rhetoric . The CCP follows a predictable playbook across industry after industry . First , attract foreign investment by promising market access . Second , coerce technology transfer through joint venture requirements and other mechanisms—pressure the U.S. Trade Representative has characterized as “ particularly intense. ” Third , support domestic firms in copying and incorporating foreign technology while building indigenous capabilities through programs such as the 2006 Medium- and Long-term Program for Science and Technology Development , which identified 402 core technologies to master . Fourth , carve out and protect the Chinese market for Chinese firms , excluding foreign competitors once domestic champions can reasonably serve the entire Chinese market . Fifth , provide massive subsidies—estimated at minimum 1.73 percent of Chinese gross domestic product ( GDP ) annually , or over $ 400 billion per year , though actual figures are likely far higher accounting for provincial and local support . Finally , support Chinese firms “ going out ” to capture global market share , particularly in developing nations through Belt and Road Initiative investments exceeding $ 1 trillion . These dwarf the minimal industrial subsidies the U.S. government ( USG ) provides . The scale of Chinese subsidies dwarfs anything in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) nations . A German institute found that in 2022 , 99 percent of listed Chinese firms received direct government subsidies , with electric vehicle ( EV ) maker BYD alone receiving over $ 3.7 billion . Chinese industrial subsidies were 4.5 times greater than U.S. subsidies as a share of GDP . Combined with a chronically undervalued currency , suppressed domestic consumption , and closed markets , these subsidies have enabled Chinese firms to sell below cost for years or decades , systematically destroying foreign competitors ’ market positions . This is not to say that all Chinese efforts or innovation are win-lose . If China invents a cure for Alzheimer ’ s , the world benefits ( assuming the United States or its allies would not also do so ) . But this would also reduce U.S. ( and allied ) strength in the pharmaceutical industry . Overall , the policy debate about China is largely dominated by international relations scholars and experts , not business or industrial strategy experts . The former are aware of the global competition for leadership in advanced industries , but they largely see it as subservient to overall foreign policy considerations and goals . Moreover , few understand the operation of advanced industries , the nature of the competition , or the importance of barriers to entry and reentry . As such , the prevailing narratives largely ignore techno-economic and trade war implications and the implications for U.S. power . Current U.S. thinking about China coalesces around three main strategic approaches , all of which are inadequate to the challenge . The first camp , still influential in much of the U.S. foreign policy establishment , prioritizes maintaining cooperative relations with China , even in the face of CCP behavior that harms U.S. national power industry capabilities . These experts argue that China ’ s growth benefits global prosperity , that Chinese cooperation is essential for addressing climate change and other global challenges , and that confrontation risks becoming a catastrophic conflict . A 2019 open letter signed by over 100 prominent scholars claimed that “ we do not believe Beijing is an economic enemy or an existential national security threat ” and argued that “ the fear that Beijing will replace the United States as the global leader is exaggerated. ” This camp consistently minimizes Chinese malfeasance while emphasizing supposed benefits of engagement . They cite Chinese economic growth as driving global prosperity ( ignoring that China ’ s persistent trade surpluses actually reduce GDP elsewhere ) . In arguing that cooperation is needed on issues such as climate change , pandemic response , and AI governance , they gloss over the question of why the United States should be the supplicant when China has equal or greater interest in addressing these challenges . Their fundamental error is treating China as a partner rather than a strategic competitor . Engagers assume that continued dialogue and economic ties will moderate China ’ s behavior , when two decades of evidence proves otherwise . They prioritize the process of engagement over the substance of outcomes , accepting Chinese predatory practices as the price of maintaining access and conversation . A second camp acknowledges China ’ s rise but counsels patience , predicting that internal contradictions will lead to Chinese economic stagnation or political crisis . These analysts point to demographic decline , the housing bubble , government debt , and the inefficiencies of state capitalism as harbingers of inevitable Chinese failure . To be sure , many advance the well-trodden prescriptions such as improved K-12 education , more high-skill immigration , smarter regulation , and more government spending on science . But they will not go so far as to support a national power industry strategy . This “ Peak China ” thesis is seductive because it requires no painful U.S. policy changes . If China is destined to collapse under its own weight , the United States need only wait and maintain its existing approaches to the economy , trade , and national security . Proponents cite any negative Chinese economic news as evidence that their predictions are materializing , while ignoring continued Chinese gains in technological capabilities and global market share of advanced industries . The fatal flaw is mistaking China for the Soviet Union . Unlike Soviet command economics , Chinese state capitalism has proven remarkably effective at generating growth and technological advancement . The CCP studied why the Soviet Union failed and adopted fundamentally different economic management—allowing market forces to operate within state-directed strategic frameworks rather than attempting to centrally plan everything . Moreover , even if China faces economic headwinds from demographics or debt , these business-cycle challenges do not negate its structural advantages in the techno-economic competition . Chinese firms will continue benefiting from massive subsidies , protected markets , and patient capital regardless of GDP growth rates . Waiting for China to self-destruct while Chinese companies dismantle Western industries one after another is a prescription for defeat . The third camp acknowledges the challenge China presents but argues that American innovation superiority will enable the United States to prevail . These “ dynamists ” focus on deregulation , immigration reform , scientific research funding , and nurturing entrepreneurship—particularly in cutting-edge fields such as AI , quantum computing , and synthetic biology . This view holds that the United States need not defend legacy industries because American innovators will create entirely new sectors and the United States will lead them . Why fight over solar panels or EVs when we can dominate AI and quantum ? The prescription is to boost science funding , reduce regulatory barriers , import more STEM ( science , technology , engineering , and math ) talent , and trust that Silicon Valley-style innovation will deliver victory . The problems with this strategy are multiple . First , with a few exceptions ( e.g. , AI ) , it is industry-agnostic—there is no guarantee that market-driven innovation will produce capabilities in sectors that matter most for national power . Second , the United States has repeatedly lost production of technologies it invented , from televisions to solar panels to batteries , as other nations have commercialized American discoveries . Innovation alone does not ensure domestic production or competitive strength . Third , advanced defense systems increasingly rely on commercial technologies ( spin-on rather than spin-off ) , making a strategy that abandons commercial sectors to China while hoping to maintain defense-only production unrealistic and prohibitively expensive . Fourth , the “ industrial commons ” —the ecosystem of suppliers , skilled workers , and manufacturing capabilities—erodes when industries disappear , making future innovation harder . Intel founder Andy Grove ’ s warning resonates : “ Abandoning today ’ s ‘ commodity ’ manufacturing can lock you out of tomorrow ’ s emerging industry. ” Finally , China is not ceding emerging technologies . Chinese firms are competitive or leading in AI ( see Alibaba , Baidu , and DeepSeek ) , quantum communications , commercial space , robotics , and biotechnology . The notion that the United States can retreat to “ higher ground ” in emerging tech while China dominates established industries ignores that Chinese firms are aggressively pursuing both . The deeper problem is that dominant U.S. economic doctrines are fundamentally mismatched to the era of national power industry competition . The reigning paradigm in U.S. economic policymaking—which critics call “ neoliberalism ” —treats all industries as equivalent . Financial services and semiconductor fabrication are no different ; both simply respond to market signals . The goal is to maximize consumer welfare through efficient resource allocation , which markets achieve better than governments do . The reigning paradigm in U.S. economic policymaking—which critics call “ neoliberalism ” —treats all industries as equivalent . In this framework , Chinese subsidies ( including low labor costs and lax environmental regulations ) are gifts to American consumers ( lower prices ! ) , not strategic attacks . Trade deficits reflect American prosperity ( we ’ re rich enough to buy foreign goods ! ) , not industrial weakness . Offshoring production to China demonstrates smart capital allocation by U.S. firms seeking higher returns , not a national security vulnerability . Consumer welfare economics has no concept of strategic industries or national power . Its proponents argue that “ countries don ’ t compete , only companies do ” and that concerns about industrial structure reflect economically illiterate protectionism . The Peterson Institute epitomizes this view , arguing that U.S.-China trade is “ clearly win-win ” and that “ Chinese companies have a right to compete with U.S. companies and succeed in any sector , including in high-tech. ” This doctrine might have been adequate when America faced no serious techno-economic competitor ; it is catastrophically inadequate against China ’ s state capitalist predation . Markets have no inherent reason to preserve semiconductor fabrication , aerospace , or pharmaceutical production domestically . They are equally happy producing legal services , retail , and hospitality , none of which enable national power . But the reality of this techno-economic and trade attack fundamentally undercuts the foundation of consumer welfare economics and exposes its inability to address the current challenge . If national power is the ultimate goal , not consumer welfare , then this doctrine fails , at least in guiding the share of the economy composed of national economic power industries . If a nation ’ s industrial mix is critical , then a doctrine that gives equal weight to potato chips and computer chips fails . The ascendant alternative on the Left is equally unsuited to the challenge . Neo–New Dealism focuses on redistribution , social justice , and worker welfare overgrowth and competitiveness . Its industrial policy priorities are human services ( childcare , eldercare ) , climate-focused sectors ( renewable energy ) , and breaking up large corporations through aggressive antitrust . While rhetorically supporting “ industrial policy , ” progressives ’ actual agenda—drug price controls , restricting intellectual property ( IP ) , mandating labor standards that limit automation , attacking profitable corporations as exploitative—systematically weakens the large advanced-technology firms that must serve as national champions against Chinese competitors . Moreover , neo–New Dealism ’ s massive social spending agenda would consume the fiscal resources needed for strategic industrial investment . Its anticorporate ideology and deep suspicion of business-government collaboration make the public-private partnerships required for an effective national power industry strategy politically toxic . The reality of the CCP ’ s techno-economic and trade war on the West undercuts the foundations of neo–New Deal progressivism . If the United States is in an existential contest for global power , then boosting taxes and regulations on business is especially ill-advised , as are the neo-Brandeisian campaign to destroy large corporations and separate unrestrained demands from organized labor . Progressive advocates know this quite well , which is why they go to any end to deny that China is even a competitor . The United States needs a fundamentally new framework : a national power industry strategy . This approach recognizes the following : ▪ Industries differ fundamentally in strategic importance . Semiconductors and furniture are not equivalent . Some sectors—defense , dual-use , and enabling—are critical to national power and must be prioritized even at short-term economic cost . ▪ Markets are indifferent to national power . Unregulated market forces will not automatically preserve strategic capabilities . Government must actively shape industrial structure through strategy , not just generic competitiveness or innovation policies . ▪ China is a strategic competitor , not a normal trading partner . Chinese mercantilism requires defensive measures ( restricting imports produced unfairly ) and offensive support ( strengthening domestic champions in national power industries ) that violate free-market and progressive orthodoxies . ▪ Production matters as much as innovation . The United States can not rely on inventing technologies that China then produces . Manufacturing capabilities , supply chain resilience , and industrial commons must be preserved domestically in strategic sectors . ▪ Long-term strategic positioning trumps short-term efficiency . Maintaining redundant capacity , subsidizing strategic industries , and accepting higher consumer prices are necessary costs of not losing the techno-economic war . This requires jettisoning the deeply held view that governments should not “ pick winners. ” Markets might optimize GDP growth , but only by happenstance will this generate needed national power industry capabilities . Policymakers must embrace strategic industry selection and support , drawing on business strategy frameworks rather than consumer welfare economics . The political economy obstacles to a national power industry strategy are severe . U.S. business leaders , shaped by decades of financial capitalism prioritizing quarterly returns and shareholder value , distrust government involvement and focus myopically on firm-level profitability rather than systemic strength . Unlike their predecessors from the 1940s–1970s who saw themselves as corporate statesmen with responsibilities to the broader capitalist system , today ’ s executives view government industrial policy as either incompetent interference or the thin edge of socialist control . Labor unions pursue short-term wage gains that often undermine firms ’ long-term global competitiveness because they are unable to escape the prisoner ’ s dilemma of aggressive bargaining today leading to job losses to less-constrained Chinese rivals tomorrow . Conservative organizations reflexively oppose the government activism required for industrial strategy , while progressive organizations reflexively oppose supporting corporations . Neither party ’ s dominant coalition supports the combination of strong state capacity and empowered corporate champions that a national power industry strategy requires . Perhaps most critically , the USG itself lacks the analytical capacity , institutional structures , and personnel with expertise to formulate and execute sophisticated industrial strategy . Unlike China , where officials study industrial policy as a discipline and spend careers mastering sectoral dynamics , U.S. policymakers typically have backgrounds in law or generalist economics divorced from operational understanding of specific industries and technologies . The United States requires political , policy , and institutional transformation comparable to previous pivots after the War of 1812 , the Civil War , and World War II . In all three cases , war provided the spur to overcome inertia and interest group resistance . We certainly hope it will not take a physical war to achieve similar transformation today . Either way , the organizing principle of economic policy must shift from maximizing consumer welfare or spurring social justice to ensuring that the United States maintains superior capabilities in national power industries relative to China . The simplest measures of this are the share of these industries ’ global output that is produced in the United States and the share of U.S. production that occurs in allied nations . Related measures are the technological sophistication of U.S. products and services in national power industries compared with those of Chinese competitors . This demands classifying industries by strategic importance , developing sophisticated strategies for priority sectors informed by business strategy principles rather than economics , restricting unfairly traded Chinese goods ’ access to allied markets , substantially increasing public and private investment in strategic sectors ( on the order of $ 100 billion per year in tax incentives and direct expenditures for at least a decade ) , coordinating with allies to present unified responses , and building government institutional capacity for industrial strategy . The United States requires political , policy , and institutional transformation comparable to previous pivots after the War of 1812 , the Civil War , and World War II . The costs will be significant : Implementing a national power industry strategy will bring higher prices for certain consumer goods , increased government spending , greater fiscal discipline elsewhere , and reduced returns for some investors as capital is channeled toward strategic rather than merely profitable uses . But the alternative is worse : a future in which Chinese dominance of advanced industries leaves the United States dependent on an adversary for critical technologies , unable to defend its interests or protect its allies , and relegated to second-tier status in a China-dominated world order . History shows that America can make fundamental pivots when circumstances demand . Whether it can do so absent the shock of military conflict—which might come too late , after critical capabilities are already lost—remains the defining question of our era . The window for effective action is narrowing . Chinese positions in industry after industry are becoming entrenched , protected by economies of scale , learning curves , network effects , and the enormous barriers to reentry that characterize advanced manufacturing . The reality is that once advanced industry capabilities are lost , they are extremely difficult to resurrect . The choice facing America is stark and unavoidable : Fundamentally reform techno-economic policy now by embracing the uncomfortable truth that some industries matter far more than others—and by recognizing that preserving them requires active government strategy—or accept a managed decline into second-tier status while China ’ s techno-economic dominance translates into geopolitical supremacy . There is no third option , no magical innovation breakthrough that will solve the problem without hard choices and real sacrifices . The United States remains far stronger than any declining power in history . Its advantages in innovation ecosystems , allied networks , capital markets , universities , and democratic legitimacy provide a foundation for successful competition if properly mobilized . But time is not on America ’ s side . Every industry lost makes recovery harder ; every year of Chinese industrial expansion shifts the balance further ; every failure to act because it violates free-market or progressive orthodoxies surrenders ground that can not be regained . The techno-economic war with China is the central challenge of the 21st century . America ’ s response will determine not just its own future but the future of the liberal democratic world . National power is a country ’ s ability to both prevent other states from taking actions against its core interests and impose its will on other nations . Traditionally , national power was largely determined by military power . In the globally integrated economy of the 21st century , a key enabler of national power is strength in industries that not only support weapons system development and production , but also provide leverage over adversaries and limit their leverage over us . This leverage can be directly related to defense , as when China produces key materials and parts going into U.S. weapons systems ( which it currently does ) or indirectly such as when China is able to cripple key U.S. industries . [ 6 ] We call these key industries that are vital to the country ’ s strategic interests “ national power industries. ” With this context , let ’ s start with a series of key questions that , if answered in the affirmative , should form an immutable logic chain in support of a paradigmatically different kind of U.S. techno-economic and trade policy . First , does the United States need to be the strongest power nation on Earth , especially over China ? If it doesn ’ t , then status quo economic and trade policies from the Left and Right will suffice . Second , if it does , then to what extent does national power come from relative strength in certain industries , particularly military , dual-use , and industries that enable the industrial commons that defense and dual-use industries rely on ? If power is only loosely related to those types of industries , then the status quo policies will suffice . Third , if national power is significantly enabled by a certain class of industries , then to what extent is China seeking and capable of gaining relative strength over the United States and its allies in these industries ? Related to that , is competition in these industries mostly win-lose , wherein China ’ s gains come at the expense of U.S. ( and allied ) losses ? If the answer is either that China is not succeeding in these industries or that its success does not come at the expense of U.S. capabilities , then status quo policies will suffice . But if the answer to all these questions is yes—as ITIF argues for in this report—then the implications are profound . The logic chain points inexorably to the conclusion that unless the United States ( and its allies ) is stronger than China in particular industries and thus has more techno-economic leverage over China than China has over us , then U.S. power vis-à-vis China will be limited and there will be transformative consequences for the global balance of power and U.S. national interests . That logic chain has , or at least should have , profound implications for U.S. techno-economic and trade policy . It establishes that the conventional neoclassical , consumer-welfare–based economics that has dominated U.S. policymaking for more than 50 years needs to be scrapped for the simple reason that it is agnostic to national industry structure . As such , unless the country adopts a new strategy , not losing the power industry war with China will come down to happenstance and luck . This is because the dominant view in Washington , even among most Democrats , is that markets determine industry structure and all industries are of equal value . Financial services are no different than semiconductor production . It can not be stressed enough that the acceptance of this core doctrine underpins virtually all U.S. techno-economic and trade policy . It explains the support for free markets and free trade and the aversion to “ picking winners. ” It explains why economic policy on the Right is about enabling market forces and on the Left about achieving better social policy outcomes by taxing and regulating the private sector . Both are indifferent to industry structure . In the past , this industry-agnostic , market-economics framework was not detrimental to national power because the United States did not face a competent techno-economic adversary in the form of the Soviet Union . In fact , the Soviet economy was incredibly fragile , and it made the U.S. economy seem like a goliath by comparison . [ 7 ] That unfortunately instilled a dangerous hubris into policy thinking that America suffers from to this day . Now that America faces a likely superior techno-economic adversary in the form of China led by the CCP , that doctrine and the policies that flow from it are no longer purpose-fit and need to be retired as quickly as possible . A world in which the United States ( and allies ) can not lose power industry strength is a world that calls for a fundamentally new kind of techno-economic and trade policy . But the next question is whether the usual alternatives to free-market economics—competitiveness policy , innovation policy , technology policies , and/or manufacturing policy—are the right paths to follow . To be sure , these differ from free-market frameworks in that they privilege certain things over others : a better trade balance in advanced industries , more innovation , more output , and jobs in technology industries and manufacturing . However , while certainly a better fit for the world the United States and allied nations now find themselves in , these approaches are still inadequate because they advocate only for broad outcomes , and like free-market doctrine , they are indifferent to power industry strategy . Even if these policies are adequate and successful—to date , they have been inadequate—there is no guarantee that adopting them would produce requisite capabilities in the industries that the United States most needs to bolster in order to have superior power over China . If we get more toy and lumber manufacturing , but not more machine-tool and semiconductor manufacturing , the United States will lose out to China . In short , the United States ( and its allies ) need to be stronger than China in the industries that are wellsprings of national power in order to prevent China from asserting power and leverage over the United States and its allies . And a world in which the United States and its allies can not lose strength in national power industries is a world that calls for a fundamentally new kind of techno-economic and trade policy . Circumstances have compelled the United States to make significant structural techno-economic and trade policy changes before : after the War of 1812 , after the Civil War , and after WWII . It is once again time for America to make such fundamental changes in policy . The stakes then were less significant for the simple reason that there was much less global integration , and our adversaries were weaker . Today , the stakes and the conditions are fundamentally different . China is the first nation in over 125 years with the ability to challenge the United States from a techno-industrial perspective . In previous instances , it took wars to trigger this kind of fundamental structural change in policy and institutions . Hopefully , it will not take a kinetic war to bring needed change today . Because if it did , there is every reason to believe that the United States and allies will already have irrevocably lost many of their power industry capabilities and prohibitive barriers to entry will leave slim prospects for regaining them . Unfortunately , status quo thinking and vested interests hinder power-industry economics from emerging . First , most foreign policy experts , even while acknowledging the authoritarian rule of Xi Jinping , continue to believe that China is a normal , market-oriented , emerging economy and that “ socialism with Chinese characteristics ” is just a slogan used for domestic purposes to mask China ’ s true capitalist nature . Second , while there is growing awareness of the West ’ s techno-economic dependence on China , that dependence is generally seen as limited to a few narrow areas , such as rare earth minerals , which are said to be easily fixed with the right policies . Third , the conventional view of international economics is both that trade is welfare-maximizing for all parties and that while companies may compete , countries do not . In other words , there is no battle for global market share in key national power industries . Finally , even the most die-hard China hawks and manufacturing supporters do not view the world in terms of power-industry competition with China . For them , getting more U.S. manufacturing jobs is the goal , whether they support national power or not . In a world with these assumptions , status-quo responses suffice . The United States and its allies compete with China and others for market share in advanced industries , and we win some and lose some . And to the extent we lose , we just create new industries and firms because of our inherent innovation strengths . Besides , old industries are for losers . To the extent trade barriers arise , they are handled through normal bilateral or multilateral processes . And domestically , the United States can rely on existing economic policies and institutional structures to ensure reasonable levels of competitiveness and prosperity . U.S. techno-economic and trade policy needs to have as its inspiration and fundamental organizing principle not ensuring economic freedom and efficiency , not social justice , and not stopping climate change—but also not losing in a wide array of strategic industries . Too many U.S. experts , pundits , and policymakers see the CCP as perhaps a bit more focused on industrial policy and a bit less interested in obeying global trade rules than the West is , but not an assertive Marxist-Leninist actor that stands apart . As such , there is no need for a radical overhaul of U.S. techno-economic and trade policy . ( Obviously the Trump administration and most China hawks are not in this camp . ) As described herein , there are many reasons for the resistance to accept this new reality . But this new reality needs to be accepted and acted upon . This report proceeds from the fundamental view that the CCP seeks global hegemony , that it views techno-economic dominance in national power industries as a key pillar of that long-standing campaign , and that it will do virtually anything to win that quest . As such , the United States and its democratic allies who stand for freedom and human rights need to respond by fundamentally rethinking and restructuring their techno-economic and trade policies . This boils down to a simple but fundamentally far-reaching proposal : U.S. ( and allied ) techno-economic and trade policy needs to have as its inspiration and fundamental organizing principle , not ensuring economic freedom and efficiency , not prioritizing social justice , not stopping climate change , and not keep AI from taking over—but instead not losing in a wide array of strategic industries . I say “ not losing , ” as opposed to winning , because China is such a formidable competitor—with a massive domestic and friendly international market ( e.g. , Belt and Road nations ) and an enormous “ bank account ” to subsidize its way to power industry market share—that it is likely not be possible to keep Chinese firms from being the leaders in many national power industries , especially in non-OECD markets . But what the West can and must do is to avoid losing its own power industry capabilities . [ 8 ] National power industries are not just any manufacturing or even technologically advanced industries . They can be thought of as three categories , from most important to least : military industries , dual-use industries , and enabling industries . Examples of military industries are guided missiles and tank production . Examples of dual use are electronic displays and semiconductors , which are used in both defense and commercial industries . Imagine as a thought exercise that China dominated optics and displays . This would give China the ability to cripple U.S. defense capabilities because optics and display technologies are critical for night-vision goggles , heads-up instrument displays for fighter pilots , rifle scopes , and myriad other military applications . Enabling industries include automobiles and heavy construction equipment , which help support the industrial commons needed for dual-use and defense industries . Industries such as furniture , cosmetics , sporting goods , wind turbines , wood products , cement , and toys are not national power industries , in part because losing them would not create any serious vulnerabilities to China . Kids might not have many toys , but we can live with that . The same is true for virtually all nontraded sectors , which are , by definition , not subject to competition from foreign imports ( e.g. , barber shops , personal service providers , etc . ) It is time for the United States government to craft a coherent power industry strategy . Because maintaining allied strength in national power industries is critical , policymakers must jettison the deeply held view that governments should not pick winners and that market outcomes are Panglossian in nature—the best of all possible worlds . Markets might optimize per-capita GDP growth ( although even here , there are market failures that suggest some government intervention is needed to maximize per-capita GDP growth ) , but only by luck and happenstance will this generate the power-industry capabilities the United States needs to maintain superiority over China . There is no inherent reason why the United States will produce telecom equipment , semiconductors , electronic displays , circuit boards , and more . And even with robust defense spending , weakness in dual-use and enabling industries would undermine the defense sector , requiring massively larger defense budgets to produce the weapons systems the Department of Defense ( DOD ) needs in specialized factories with limited economies of scale . Markets , for all their value , are happy to enable the production of financial advisors , legal services , and high-end garments , while allowing dual-use sectors to wither and die in the face of subsidized Chinese production . This is true even with a robust national manufacturing strategy , which might end up with more production of shoes , golf clubs , and two-by-fours , but not optics , machine tools , and lasers , which weapons systems need . Policymakers already understand this when it comes to the production of weapons such as fighter aircraft and guns . While private companies make these , they do so under government contracts . It ’ s time to extend that thinking to dual-use and enabling industries too—not that in all or even most cases would these industries be supported by government contracts . But in all cases , there should be well-crafted and effectively implemented government strategies to ensure continued dynamic capabilities in national power industries . The implications of this simple yet profoundly important change in thought are significant . In short , it is time for the United States government to craft a coherent power industry strategy . No , this does not mean state socialism or crony capitalism and Solyndra . No , it does not mean corporate welfare . But it does require embracing the concept of national power industry strategy , some of which , as described ahead , can be built on the insights from the scholarly and professional literature on corporate strategy . Despite what some free-market conservatives argue , America ’ s economic and trade policies have not been consistent since the founding of the Republic . Rather , key inflection points have occurred , leading to new beliefs , institutional arrangements , and policies . And each time , America ’ s leaders have made the right choice , although often through trial and error and incremental adjustments . But the transformations have been made that have enabled a more powerful and wealthier nation . It ’ s worth reviewing these historical pivots . From its colonial founding until the second war with the British ( the War of 1812 ) , American leaders largely saw the colonies and then the nation as a peripheral , natural resource economy , dependent on Britain for trade in manufactured goods that were to be paid for through exports of staples ( wood , fish , tobacco , furs , etc. ) . After the revolution , some , such as Alexander Hamilton , recognized that this was fundamentally a relationship of dependency . That is why he “ believed that in industry lay our great national destiny. ” [ 9 ] He did not want America to remain a “ hewer of wood and drawer of water. ” Indeed , he argued that government should “ cultivate particular branches of trade ... and to discourage others. ” [ 10 ] That ’ s why America ’ s first successful manufacturing firm , the Society of Useful Manufacturers , was funded by the state of New Jersey and leading American financiers that Hamilton convinced to fund it . Even Jefferson embraced national developmentalism , including protective tariffs . [ 11 ] As president , his goal was to repay the national debt and then use the revenues to fund “ rivers , canals , roads , arts , manufacturers , education and other great objects. ” [ 12 ] He “ encouraged new branches of industry that may be advantageous to the public , either by offering premiums for discoveries , or by purchasing from their proprietors such inventions as shall appear to be of immediate and general utility , and rendering them free to the citizens at large. ” [ 13 ] But it wasn ’ t until the shock of the war of 1812 that a true consensus for industrial development emerged . Indeed , in 1816 Jefferson wrote , “ You tell me I am quoted by those who wish to continue our dependence on England for manufactures . There was a time when I might have been so quoted with more candor , but within the 30 years , which have since elapsed , how are circumstances changed ! ” [ 14 ] Jefferson was a man who was willing to change his thinking when conditions required doing so . Indeed , the war broadened and heightened calls for more efforts to develop American industry . Henry Clay and other Whigs devised “ the American System , ” consisting of tariffs to protect and promote industry ; a national bank to foster commerce ; and federal subsidies for roads , canals , and other domestic improvements . The latter also involved subsidies to targeted industries , including at the state government level . When running in 1832 as a Whig , Abraham Lincoln stated , “ [ M ] y politics are short and sweet , like the old woman ’ s dance . I am in favor of a national bank ... in favor of the internal improvements system , and a high protective tariff. ” [ 15 ] These changes enabled the development of American industries , many driven by waterpower , including textiles , muskets and rifles , shipbuilding , and others . The next pivot was the Civil War . This time the core change domestically was whether the United States would fully embrace industrialization to become a world power , with the centralization of power and high tariff walls that entailed . Or would it allow industrialization to occur at its own pace with much of the U.S. economy maintained as an agrarian and plantation export economy . Southern plantation states opposed this mission and the institutional changes that it entailed , in part because it meant higher prices for what farmers consumed and reduced overseas markets for what they sold . The Civil War made the choice inexorable , and with the victory of the Northern States , the United States proceeded to industrialize at a rapid rate behind a high tariff wall and with the support of defense industry purchases . Indeed , for the rest of that century , the United States was the China of its day : an economy in which industrialization was everything and growth was off the charts . This led European countries to despair . As David Kedrosky wrote : Frederick Arthur McKenzie ’ s The American Invaders and WT Stead ’ s The Americanization of the World ( both 1901 ) were just two of an avalanche of publications advertising the rot of Britain and the inevitability of its supersession by its youthful , vigorous former colony . Economists cast about for something , or someone , to blame . [ 16 ] He went on to cite leading British economists Alfred Marshall , who sounded the alarm in 1903 ( wish that we had more Alfred Marshalls today in the United States ) : Sixty years ago England had leadership in most branches of industry . It was inevitable that she should cede much to the great land which attracts alert minds of all nations to sharpen their inventive and resourceful faculties by impact on one another . It was inevitable that she should yield a little of it to that land of great industrial traditions which yoked science in the service of man with unrivalled energy . It was not inevitable that she should lose so much of it as she has done . [ 17 ] The next major pivot came with the American victory in WWII and then the rise of an aggressive and expansive Marxist-Leninist Soviet Union . After WWII , the forces for returning to the pre-war status quo were strong . In 1946 , Truman ’ s State of the Union speech called for bringing most troops home and demobilizing . [ 18 ] And his economic policy was to continue New Deal social programs but embrace Keynesian cycle management . But it was only after Soviet expansionism into Eastern Europe , the development in 1947 of the “ Truman Doctrine , ” a few years later Stalin giving the green light for Kim Il Sung to invade South Korea , and seven years later the Soviets launching Sputnik that America responded with overwhelming force . The United States chose to assume leadership of the free world , in part because of the fall of the British Empire and the benefits that came with hegemony , but also become someone needed to stop Soviet expansionism . Indeed , NSC-162-2 , a new national security policy generated through the Solarium project initiated by President Eisenhower , argued for a new approach to national policy to address the Soviet threat . [ 19 ] Among other things , it called for , “ in the face of the Soviet threat , the security of the United States requires … A mobilization base , and its protection against crippling damage , adequate to insure victory in the event of general war. ” This new strategic approach meant several things : first , the rejection of tariffs and the embrace of free trade and global integration , in part to ensure more stable democracies around the world aligned with the United States , because at home , the Cold War meant unprecedented massive funding for science and technology . Second , starting in WWII , the federal government dramatically ramped up its support for advanced industry . By the early 1960s , it spent more on research and development ( R & D ) than the rest of the world combined . [ 20 ] That fueled an enormous array of breakthroughs , including computers , semiconductors , jet aviation , lasers , numerically controlled machine tools , satellites , relational databases , and of course , the Internet . Indeed , NSC-162-2 called the United States to “ [ c ] onduct and foster scientific research and development so as to insure superiority in quantity and quality of weapons systems , with attendant continuing review of the level and composition of forces and the industrial base required for adequate defense and successful prosecution of general war. ” [ 21 ] Starting in WWII , the federal government dramatically ramped up its support for advanced industry . By the early 1960s , it spent more on R & D than the rest of the world combined . Turning points are hard . There is a reason societies establish routines , fixed institutions , and common rules . Changing them is hard . Vested interests oppose them . Few experts have the intellectual fortitude to challenge their own frameworks . Voters get comfortable with the status quo . And democratic politics makes change hard . But as history shows , when the disjuncture between external reality and internal frameworks and approaches becomes wide enough , America has been able to successfully embrace pivot points . Perhaps the most important question facing the nation today is , does the U.S. political economy have the capability , absent a military conflict with China , to make the needed changes ? The final part of this report examines this question . After the Soviet threat evaporated in the early 1990s , American leadership assumed that the United States was not only in a unipolar moment , but that , as Francis Fukayama argued , history itself had ended . [ 22 ] In other words , Western liberal democratic capitalism had triumphed over all . If he had in fact been correct , there would be no need to write this report , as China would be well on the way to a free-market democracy . But also , he and most others were so enthused by the collapse of the Soviet Union that enthusiasm overrode reality . As a result , the ideological and policy ideas that went with this phase have not only remained as core to U.S. techno-economic and trade governance , but at least until recently , become even more embedded in American thinking . Since America won , there was and is no real historical turning point other than one that reinforced the primacy of the U.S. system . Four core ideas remain . First , it is America ’ s role to advance free trade and globalization even if it was not in our narrow interest . Free trade , especially other nations selling to America , helped ensure that they entered the American orbit and not the Soviet one or remained unaligned . The U.S. economy was so strong that it could afford uneven trading arrangements . Indeed , until the early 1970s , the U.S. economy enjoyed trade surpluses . Later , as those surpluses turned to trade deficits and the United States became the importer of last resort , the view was that the U.S. economy was still the strongest , and besides , trade deficits not only didn ’ t matter , but they were also a reflection of economic strength . Ahh , the power of wishful thinking . On top of that was the pervasive idea held by the foreign policy establishment and economists that not only was all trade good , but so too was the movement of U.S. business operations overseas . Indeed , a 2013 survey of Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) members found that 73 percent believed that the U.S. economy would be strengthened if more U.S. companies set up operations overseas . In contrast , just 23 percent of the U.S. public believed this . [ 23 ] One is reminded of William Buckely ’ s quip that he would rather live in a society governed by the first 2,000 names in the Boston phone book than one governed by 2,000 Harvard faculty members . [ 24 ] Also , 52 percent of CFR members predicted that China would become more democratic by 2023 and 34 percent thought China would be a key future ally by then . President Xi , did you see this survey ? If so , why did you not go along with the CFR folks ? As surpluses turned to trade deficits and the United States became the importer of last resort , the view was that the U.S. economy was still the strongest , and besides , trade deficits not only didn ’ t matter , but they were also a reflection of economic strength . Following in the intellectual path set by classical economist David Ricardo , the consensus view became that trade was always win-win , and there was a comparative advantage wherever a nation ’ s industrial structure was based on—unless distorted by suboptimal government policies—inherent natural comparative advantages . Not only was there no reason for government to alter “ natural ” industrial structure , but it was also welfare reducing to do so . Moreover , to the extent there were foreign deviations from free trade , they were seen as barriers and distortions that hurt the countries putting them in place , not as attacks on U.S. companies and the U.S. economy . In this regard , free trade is seen as a natural phenomenon producing natural and superior results . The fact that most of the rest of the world neither believed nor practiced this only reinforced the messianic mission of America to teach the heathens the errors of their ways and convert them to the free trade religion . Second , what ultimately buttressed this the way free booze buttresses an alcoholic was the fact that the U.S. dollar was the reserve currency . The dollar was accepted everywhere , and ultimately , if the United States needed more dollars , unlike any other nation , it could simply print more . This is termed the “ exorbitant privilege ” that let the United States run massive trade deficits for decades . In realty , it was not a privilege but an albatross around America ’ s neck , allowing policymakers to be indifferent to structural trade deficits . With such massive trade deficits , any other nation would have had to devalue its currency and grow its exports and reduce imports . But not the United States . And so , U.S. manufacturing , including national power industries , shrank . And because there was no real consequence to this—foreign nations continued to pour money into the United States , in part to keep their currency values low and exports high—it was easy for American pundits and experts to ignore and deny the decay of American power industry capabilities . Indeed , most to this day still defend the reserve currency status of the dollar as a key source of national power , instead of what it really is : a cancer on national power industry competitiveness . Third , because the techno-economic power imbalance between the United States and the Soviets was so large , there was no need for a strategic industry policy . The Soviets might have had a peer-competitor military , but they by no means had a peer-competitor set of national power industries . And one reason was that Soviet command economics , unlike Chinese state capitalism , was incredibly limiting . Soviet Gosplan was in fact a central planner and allocator of goods and services . Fourth , science and technology proceeded from funding to scientists to pursue basic research in whatever areas they chose ( what FDR science advisor Vannevar Bush laid out as the linear model of basic science to commercial production ) and company-funded research based on market forces alone . This meant that just as “ computer chips , potato chips what ’ s the difference ? ” prevailed in economic thinking , “ astrophysics , quantum physics what ’ s the difference ? ” prevailed in science funding . In other words , the United States was so far ahead of other nations in science that it had the luxury of funding a large share of the world ’ s basic , exploratory research that other nations used to build their advanced industry export economies . As such , neoclassical , non-goal-oriented economic policy became accepted as all-time truth . It was true everywhere and always . Short-run efficiency generated from market actors operating in response to market-determined price signals was the lode star . Externalities , with perhaps the exception of pollution , were few and far between , and government ’ s efforts to intervene in this natural , indeed beautiful , process were , by definition , welfare-reducing . This truth still dominates U.S. expert , pundit , and policymaker thinking . An emblematic example is a Washington Post op-ed excoriating President Trump ’ s conditioning CHIPS Act grant funding to Intel on the federal government getting an ownership share . Yes , this was a bad decision , but not because it violated free-market dogma , but because it ultimately weakened Intel , clearly a power industry company . [ 25 ] The Post ’ s statement is a perfect reflection of what current U.S. consensus is regarding techno-economic and trade policy where power industry concerns are nonexistent : This deal is the culmination of America ’ s resurgent interest in industrial policy , the same interest we always develop when we sense a challenge to our global economic dominance . Whenever we spot a new competitor on the horizon , we look wistfully at China — or Germany , or Japan — and wonder if it ’ s a mistake to let the market decide what America produces . Maybe we should learn a lesson from the competition and let the government , with its deep pockets and longer time-horizons , take a bigger role in shaping the economy . This particular policy also risks distorting the free-market system that has delivered better results for America , and the world , than any state-managed competitor has ever achieved . And it is unlikely to fix the deep problems with Intel , which have been decades in the making . There is an argument for industrial policy in strategically vital products . The United States does not want to source critical defense inputs from geostrategic rivals . But that argument only works if you make three dubious assumptions : that the government can confine its efforts to strategically important industries ( rather than , say , bailing out failing automakers with politically powerful unions ) ; that it can spend the money wisely ( rather than wasting huge sums on efforts that sounded better to planners than to buyers ) ; and that the companies that find themselves showered with money will use it to turn themselves into globally competitive superstars , rather than to maintain a lackluster operation thanks to the subsidies . [ 26 ] A few years ago , this op-ed would have been exactly the same , but without the reference to the need for “ strategically vital products. ” At least now elite discourse has to include a passing reference to this , before it then breezes on praising the wonders of the free market . There is one final component of the America ’ s techno-economic and trade doctrine , one that did not emerge until the fall of the Soviet Union : American hubris . In its close , the op-ed at least considers that it might be necessary for the United States to have strong national power industries , but the authors still couldn ’ t help themselves and fall back into conventional thinking , claiming that the old model actually works when it comes to national power industries . Government , it claims : can also work harder on improving infrastructure and fixing government policies that drive up manufacturing costs , such as land-use regulations and taxes . But the United States should not try to beat China by becoming China . We should compete the way we always have : by relying on the free enterprise system that has served us so well for so long . [ 27 ] If this is not a rejection of the need for a doctrinal shift in response to an historical turning point , I don ’ t know what is . There is one final component of the America ’ s techno-economic and trade doctrine , one that did not emerge until the fall of the Soviet Union : American hubris . At least during the Cold War , leaders on both sides of the aisle were worried about the Soviet challenge , not just militarily but also technologically , especially in the 1950s and 1960s as Soviet space and nuclear technology advanced . In hindsight , the technology threat was overstated , but nonetheless , policymakers remained apprehensive , ever focused on maintaining our lead . Now , absent that threat , America suffers from what Chinese political economist Heng-Fu Zou calls “ status-quo-based optimism. ” [ 28 ] In other words , too many U.S. experts and policymakers still see the world as it was from 1990 to the mid-2000s when the belief was that United States was preeminent in virtually everything . Communism had been defeated and was consigned to the dustbin of history . China was a poor , developing market economy , not a development-oriented Marxist-Leninist dictatorship . And emerging signs that China might be becoming a peer competitor were almost completely ignored by the expert class , so much so that individuals and organizations that tried to issue warnings were dismissed as cranks . Case in point : the U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission , an entity created by Congress as a sop to those worried about the effects of letting China in the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) . For years , the view in Washington was that these were a bunch of crazed China hawks and it was largely frowned upon for experts to testify in front of this commission . Because the United States had vanquished its foes and stood tall and unopposed ( except by jihadists that turned airplanes into missiles ) , that meant , by definition , that the current techno-economic and trade system was optimal . It had led to the prosperous and strong America . No one could touch us . So why challenge what had worked so well ? This is perhaps the driving factor in why so many in the expert and political classes are so closed to considering new techno-economic and trade frameworks . The old/current system worked great . Why fix it if it ain ’ t broke ? Accepting realities would mean a weakening of the foundations of the tripartite American techno-economic and trade doctrine : free trade , free markets , and reserve currency . That doctrine , and the professional reputations built upon it , must , at all costs , be defended . And it is also why so many in the expert and political classes are almost completely impervious to data suggesting that reality no longer exists , especially the increasingly obvious Chinese techno-economic rise and the concomitant American decline , as well as Xi ’ s Marxist-Leninist global hegemonic aspirations . Reams of data showing China ’ s techno-economic rise are ignored or denied , as is data showing U.S. decline . Well , the data must be wrong . Or China is different . Or the data doesn ’ t apply to the United States . Besides , we all know that China has a host of short-term business cycle challenges ( e.g. , housing glut ) , so no need to consider structural change . A bit more science spending , some regulatory tweaks , and some more high-skilled immigration and all will be ship-shape . Accepting these realities would mean a weakening of the foundations of the tripartite American techno-economic and trade doctrine : free trade , free markets , and reserve currency . That doctrine , and the professional reputations built upon it , must , at all costs , be defended . In other words , the consensus among the elite class is that the current system suffices . However , what is striking about past fundamental pivots in American techno-economic and trade systems is that all were in response to war : the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 ; the Civil War ; and WWII and the Korean War . Before each of these conflicts , the consensus view was for the then current system . Few policymakers and elites had any real desire to change , and those that did were in the minority with no real power . It was the shock and destruction of war that made the rejection of the old system and the embrace of a new system a virtual requirement . Today , without a great-power war to spur change , there is little that is doing so . The Chinese national power trade attacks are not major battles , but rather a constant drip-drip of allied and U.S. losses that are either overlooked or rationalized as inconsequential . Better to defend the tripartite system of free trade , free-market economics , and reserve dollar and attack or ignore anyone who has the temerity to challenge it . Better to attack Trump as a clueless protectionist rather than to acknowledge that his concerns , if not necessarily his policies , reflect a new reality . It is possible that a People ’ s Republic of China ( PRC ) invasion of Taiwan might produce such a motive force . But it might not because U.S. leaders and the public could just give up and either not intervene or intervene but quickly withdraw after casualty numbers go up and missile stocks go down . If the PRC were smart and understood America , it would bide its time ( it can no longer hide its light ) until its GDP and power industry and military capabilities significantly outweigh those of the United States and the West . If it invaded then , even if the shock of war and defeat were enough to highlight the defects of the current system and motivate the embrace of a new one , it would be too late to do anything meaningful . U.S. and allied techno-organizational capabilities for renewal , including an existing advanced industrial base , would be below what is needed . As discussed ahead , the barriers to entry in most of these complex and capital-intensive industries would be too high . Even if the American populace and the elite class came together with a massive Sputnik-like movement and responded , the amount of effort and money needed to rebuild would be enormous . And so t he techno-economic war would be over , and the United States would have lost most of its national power industry capabilities with virtually no way to get them back , akin to the United Kingdom after WWII . All the United Kingdom can do now is show nostalgic TV shows on BBC about when Britannia ruled the world . Box 1 : Britain ’ s Failure to Grasp Its Turning Point Like America , Britain faced a turning point during and after WWII , but unlike the United States , it failed to successfully turn , resulting in the permanent ( at least to today ) , long-term deindustrialization and decline of the United Kingdom . In his masterful book The Audit of War : The Illusion and Reality of Britain as a Great Nation , British historian Correlli Barnett documented the failures and why . [ 29 ] Like noted industrial historian Alfred Chandler , Barnett argued that British industry did not succeed in emulating American mass production and the management that went along with it . As Elbaum and Lazonick wrote : Successful capitalist development in twentieth century German , Japan and the United States demonstrates the ubiquitous importance of the visible hand of corporate bureaucratic management . To meet with international challenge , British industries required transformation of their strategies of industrial relations , industrial organization , and enterprise management . Vested interests in the old structures , however , proved formidable obstacles to the old transition from competitive to corporate modes of organization . [ 30 ] The result was significant lags in productivity and quality of manufactured goods , especially compared with Germany and the United States . And in many areas , Britain was completely dependent on other nations . For example , during the war , Britain was totally reliant on the United States for over 20 kinds of machine tools it had never been able to make itself . [ 31 ] Some of this was due to poor management ; many firms were still family owned and modest in size . Much of it was due to strong labor unions and their utter opposition to the kinds of industrial organization and job change that would be required to boost efficiency to be able to compete internationally . It would have been one thing if Britain were losing its old industries but at least gained the new ones , such as chemicals , electronics , and aerospace . But it failed there as well , in part because of the persistence of the craft industry , as opposed to mass production—and also because the government spent so little on R & D . At the same time , the schools and university system , unlike that of Germany and the United States , focused on traditional education , especially learning the classics , and neglected both skilled-trades education and STEM education . It wasn ’ t that certain groups and individuals in government were not aware of these challenges . Some were and proposed fairly far-reaching industrial policy changes that , if implemented , would have certainly reduced the scope and scale of deindustrialization and lack of progress in emerging science-based industries . But at a political economy level , there were three forces that meant failure . The first was the long-standing British free-market ideology , especially among economists that eschewed any more than minimal government role in restructuring industry . And the Conservative Party ’ s top priority was on “ sound finance ” and free trade . And many economists opposed scrapping out-of-date industrial machinery until that had been completely depreciated and was no longer working . The second was the rise of the Labour Party and its massive embrace of what Barnett has called “ The New Jerusalem ” : the idea that the state would provide a new almost utopian life for British citizens through public spending . Based in part on the 1942 “ Beverage Report , ” which called for “ cradle to grave ” public support , including national health insurance , massive housing spending , and more money on education , the new Labour government under Atlee saw this as its overwhelming task to implement these wartime proposals . Indeed , the view of many was that Britain deserved this after its all-out fight to defeat Hitler . As Barnett wrote , “ New Jerusalem was their [ British ‘ enlightened ’ establishment Party officials ] high-minded gift which they proceeded successfully to press on the British people between 1940 and 1945 , with far-reaching effects on the British people ’ s postwar chances as an industrial power struggling for survival and prosperity. ” [ 32 ] This massive new social services spending campaign crowded up virtually all needed public investment to be able to compete . It was not that the officials didn ’ t know that this would cost a lot of money . Rather , as Barnett wrote , they pursued this vision “ on the best romantic principle that sense must bend to feeling , and facts to faith , ” much like American conservatives and liberals push for tax cuts and spending increases , respectively , even when the till is empty . [ 33 ] And ironically , the factor that held both the Conservative and Labour views together was the still prevalent individualism over communitarianism . School reform was based on freedom for the individual , rather than on what would boost national power . Spending was based on satisfying immediate needs , rather than boosting national power in the medium term . As a result , national investment was minimal , just one-third of post-war Germany levels . In summary , Barnett stated , “ If Britain after the war was to earn the immense resources required to maintain her cherished traditional place as a great power and at the same time to pay for New Jerusalem at home , she had to achieve nothing short of an economic miracle . Such a miracle could only be wrought through the transformation , material and human , of her essentially obsolete industrial society into one capable of triumphing in the world markets of the future. ” [ 34 ] Had all the most powerful groups and institutions in that society enthusiastically been willing to throw themselves behind the process of transformation , it still would have been difficult enough to achieve , given the scale of inherited problems . But instead of such willingness , there existed massive inertial resistance to change , which was so manifest in the history of Briain as an industrial society ; a resistance that not even the shock of war had proved strong enough to budge more than a little . [ 35 ] What does this all mean then ? First and foremost , it means that the core challenge for America is wholesale abandonment of the post-war free-trade comparative advantage , free-market , and reserve currency doctrines and practices , and their replacement with doctrines and practices fitted for U.S.-China power industry conflict , as discussed ahead . But the reality is that the preservation of U.S. and allied techno-economic power needs to take center stage in American politics and government . As Chinese scholar Heng-Fu Zou wrote in an article modeling China-U.S. great power competition , “ Power is not a neutral consequence of growth , but a strategic externality . As a result , national welfare depends negatively on rival strength , even absent direct miliary confrontation. ” [ 36 ] He went on to argue , “ This provides formal justification for industrial policies aimed at limiting rival capacity … These policies are rational from a strategic welfare standpoint , even if they reduce short-run efficiency. ” [ 37 ] His last point is one that simply can not be understood by most America economists who see reducing short-run efficiency as the height of economic stupidity . Compared with China , the Soviet Union was a pre-season warm-up game in the minor leagues . Sure , it had military strength , including a powerful nuclear arsenal . But it ’ s ability to degrade America ’ s techno-economic strength was minimal and its ability to generate its own strength was even less . At the same time , proactive domestic policies are needed . As Zho has stated , “ Without proactive [ U.S. ] efforts to rebuild internal economic structure—both material ( capital , factories , supply chains ) and immaterial ( skills , institutional memory , R & D ecosystems ) —the relative power dynamic will continue to tilt toward China. ” [ 38 ] Given today ’ s reality of China ’ s rise and America ’ s decline , this should be so obvious that it need not even be stated . But alas , it is not and so it needs to be asserted . Zou summed it up : Strategic rivalry in the 21st century is driven not only by military buildup or ideological narratives , but by underlying economic flows , learning dynamics and structural investments . Geopolitical outcomes are endogenous to trade , production and policy strategy . For the United States , reversing strategic decline will require more than tactical trade defense [ e.g. , tariffs ] ; it will require a coordinated industrial renaissance . [ 39 ] This reality should be extremely sobering . Compared with China , the Soviet Union was a pre-season warm-up game in the minor leagues . Sure , it had military strength , including a powerful nuclear arsenal . But it ’ s ability to degrade America ’ s techno-economic strength was minimal and its ability to generate its own strength was even less , even as it engaged in massive IP spying and buying capabilities from the Europeans , who like today , were always willing to make a euro , even if it meant enabling an adversary . Maybe Lenin was thinking of them when he said , “ the capitalists will sell us the rope by which we will hang them. ” [ 40 ] By the early 1980s , U.S. techno-economic dominance over the Soviet Union had become increasingly apparent to U.S. policymakers . [ 41 ] As such , that conflict was largely about military capability and convincing the rest of the world that the capitalist , democratic system was superior to the socialist , authoritarian one . That was as easy as arguing that Micheal Jordan was better than an NBA player coming off the bench . China is the finals of the major league . What is China ? That is the key question to answer . Much of the need to adopt a new techno-economic and trade doctrine depends on a simple question of what China is and what it wants to accomplish . The conventional view among most U.S. foreign policy experts is that it is a normal capitalist nation ( albeit an authoritarian one ) that just wants to develop as other developing nations have ; or as some will admit , it just wants to have strategic independence from the United States . The reality is that view is deeply naïve . The Chinese government is not a “ normal ” developing nation seeking growth , or even a fifth “ Asian Tiger ” seeking to rapidly move up the value chain through exports . China is a Marxist-Leninist dictatorship seeking global techno-economic domination by growing its own firms in virtually all emerging and foundational advanced technology industries . The intended casualty is the global market share and even the survival of Western and U.S. firms and industries . China ’ s arsenal includes an array of weapons , including massive subsidies , IP theft , standards manipulation , closed domestic markets , and the incorporation into the Chinese orbit of an array of developing economies . China is not a free trader or a protectionist , the only categories available for Western discourse . Rather , drawing on historical parallels , namely Albert Hirschman ’ s account of pre-war German economic policy , China ’ s subsidies , market closing , intellectual-property coercion , and overcapacity dumping are neither accidental nor benign . They revive the notion that trade can be weaponized , a concept powerfully elaborated by Farrell and Newman in “ Weaponized Interdependence. ” [ 42 ] China is a “ power trader ” rather than a mere beneficiary of globalization , and that means we need to realign the policy debate toward defense of critical industries that enable national power and away from simplistic free trade versus protectionism binaries . A key CCP weapon is flooding foreign markets with lower-priced products in order to capture market share from foreign leaders . Many trade experts refer to this process as Chinese overcapacity , as if this is simply an unexpected effect of the various forces at work in the Chinese economy . In reality , product “ dumping ” is a conscious decision at the core of the Chinese strategy of capturing global market share . Chinese companies are able to price below costs because they are subsidized by the state ( and enjoy other cost advantages ) . And they know that companies in capitalist economies will not have the patience to suffer losses for more than a short period , after which they will cede market share and reallocate their capital to higher profit activities , including going bankrupt and returning capital to shareholders , or if they could get USG approval , selling their assets to a Chinese company . The CCP also knows that , for the most part , foreign governments have neither the fiscal capability nor the political will to subsidize their companies ’ losses . And so , the bulldozer of value destruction keeps coming . We have already seen the results in an array of industries , including telecom equipment , commercial drones , solar panels , shipbuilding , bulk chemicals , LCD displays , and many others . And China is continuing to attack across a wide array of industries and technologies , including semiconductor memory and logic , biopharmaceuticals , fine chemicals , EVs and batteries , quantum computing , AI , aerospace , and others . If the United States , and the West more broadly , allows China to weaken and even destroy much of our advanced industry , America will look like the UK—largely an industrial and technology wasteland—and China will be the most powerful nation on earth , with attendant economic , military , and foreign policy consequences . China is a Marxist-Leninist dictatorship seeking global techno-economic domination by growing its own firms in virtually all emerging and foundational advanced technology industries . The intended casualty is the global market share and even the survival of Western and U.S. firms and industries . History has seen other campaigns such as this . From the late 1800s to World War II , Germany illustrated how trade could be weaponized into “ an instrument of power , of pressure and even of conquest , ” wrote the development economist Albert O. Hirschman . [ 43 ] Like China , Germany mostly focused on importing goods needed for its war machine , redirected trade to friendly or subject nations and sought to control oceanic trade routes , all in an effort to limit development of its adversaries . Like China , the German government kept its currency undervalued ( making its goods relatively cheaper for consumers in other countries ) , leveraged the use of tariffs and subsidized its exports to bolster its position in industry goods such as steel , chemicals and machinery . If China was a “ normal ” country , focused on democracy , free trade , and generally market-oriented policies , there would be no need for this conversation . But China is not a normal country in the context of most other nations . First , despite what its leaders might present to the West , it is a Marxist-Leninist state . [ 44 ] After Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s , the CCP did not make the fatal mistakes the Soviets made of seeking a command economy where the state allocated resources . But it did not seek a market economy either . The CCP knew and knows what it wants the economy to evolve to—which , frankly , is not hard to know given a more than rudimentary understanding of industry and technology—and it sets directions . But , unlike the Soviets with their central planning from agencies such as Gosplan , the CCP lets companies do the rowing to get to the intended destination . The government ’ s job is to provide companies with a massive amount of help , including weakening their foreign competitors . Second , China has an overall power industry strategy , as well as scores if not hundreds of strategies for particular industries and technologies ( e.g. , medical devices ) . Because of that , most economic players row in the same direction . Local and provincial governments , financiers , companies , and entrepreneurs—they all are attuned to the direction CCP leadership wants them to go and , while there are certainly tensions and often massive waste ( which Chinese citizens pay for with their underconsumption ) , there are also massive victories . Third , unlike the West , and particularly the Anglo-American West , China ’ s focus is not on the individual . Americans are bombarded on a daily basis with how this or that policy will affect their welfare as consumers ( “ Trump tariffs will raise prices ! ” ) , investors ( “ Trump tariffs will lower stock prices ! ” ) , workers ( “ AI will kill jobs ! ” ) , and residents ( “ These wind turbines will make noise ! ” ) . And the national interest is relegated to the bottom of the list , if it is even considered . Indeed , in this framing , there is no national interest , only the aggregate voices of individual interests as consumers , investors , workers and residents . As such , if something is good for the nation but raises prices , lowers stock values , eliminates jobs , or disrupts a neighborhood , it is , by definition , bad . Just as the U.S. economics profession embraced Ricardian trade theory and free-market economics , the U.S. political science profession , especially after the 1950s , embraced the theory of pluralism that held that the public interests was just the amalgam of competing interests . Academics such as Charles Lindblom , David Truman , and Robert Dahl led that charge . When a nation has to operate with those constraints , it is amazing that anything gets done other than what the most powerful forces can force through . If the United States , and the West more broadly , allows China to weaken and even destroy much of our advanced industry , America will look like the United Kingdom—largely an industrial and technology wasteland—and China will be the most powerful nation on earth , with attendant economic , military , and foreign policy consequences . On top of that , the overriding U.S. focus is on consumer orientation , what Keynes termed as “ more jam today. ” Harvard ’ s Bruce Scottt wrote in 1997 that “ policies that favor consumption , consumer borrowing , and leisure are components of a consumer orientation . Public provision of enhanced economic security is also a consumer-oriented notion ; it allows consumers to take less responsibility for themselves , and thus to leverage a given level of income with additional debt. ” [ 45 ] We have only doubled down on that since Scott wrote those words , cutting taxes , massively expanding entitlements , and slashing true public investments . Lots of jam ! China doesn ’ t worry about that . The CCP runs things—not investors , not consumers , not workers , and not residents . Chinese citizens can ’ t vote and have almost no voice in whether the CCP immiserates them in order to win the bigger , longer-term techno-economic war . Take peasants ’ land to build a port ? No problem . Keep the value of the RMB currency low so consumers pay more for imports ? No problem . Put the pedal to the metal with robotic and other forms of automation , even if workers lose their jobs ? No problem . The CCP doesn ’ t privilege self-interested individuals or organizations over the country as a whole , and as a result , it has much more smooth sailing to boost its national power industries . China has a producer orientation . As Scott wrote about Asian nations such as South Korea : [ They are ] built on the notion of increased resource mobilization so as to have … “ more jam tomorrow. ” Producer-oriented nations favor saving and investment , technology acquisition , and skills upgrading through education and training , all of which imply less jam today as well as more tomorrow . In addition to increased resource mobilization , producer-oriented societies are characterized by market structures—capital , product , and labor—that permit producer institutions , firms , and associations to hold a great deal of power , while restricting that allowed to labor as well as to consumers . [ 46 ] To be clear , the United States should not adopt a repressive government . But Americans need to dial back selfishness and embrace more civic virtue , ending the focus on “ more jam today ” and replacing it with “ more jam tomorrow. ” Fourth , while America prioritizes allocation efficiency , the CCP prioritizes effectiveness of actions leading to increased industrial power . American elites see markets as an end because markets optimize efficiency . The CCP sees markets as just one of many tools to achieve its goal : global dominance in national power industries . That orientation is better for winning great power competition because markets are largely indifferent to winning or losing that competition . Markets are not indifferent to maximizing wealth , at least in the short run . But power and wealth are quite different things . And an economy that boasts the world ’ s most efficient personal services , utilities , hotel and lodging , and FIRE ( finance , insurance , and real estate ) sectors might be the richest . But an economy that can boast the largest national power industries will be the most powerful . Fifth , a key difference between China and the United States is an obvious one : China is not a democracy . The lack of democratic constraints on government means that the CCP can afford to spend enormous sums ( direct and indirect tax expenditures ) on supporting Chinese national power industries . Chinese citizens surely have some pain point over taxes , but it is clearly considerably lower than Americans ’ pain point , as U.S. voters will go the ramparts if the gas tax is even indexed to inflation or if a politician even says they have considered a minor reduction in entitlements . America needs to stop focusing on “ more jam today ” and instead focus on “ more jam tomorrow. ” Sixth , like the Asian tigers ( e.g. , Hong Kong , South Korea , Singapore , Taiwan ) Chinese officials are steeped in the discipline of industrial and technology policy . Yes , there is scholarly industrial policy discipline to study , and it is largely ignored in the Anglo-Saxon and most European nations . However , Chinese officials study it intently . Most have read the “ Adam Smith ” of national developmentalism , Friedrich List , even if few American economists even know who he is . [ 47 ] In contrast , the level of education and knowledge of national developmentalism in the United States is minimal , with national policymakers usually having backgrounds in law . And economics does not involve the study of industry or technology , but rather how price-mediated markets work . And elite economists and policymakers look with disdain at the field of industrial policy and national developmentalism , if they even deign themselves to notice it at all . Seventh , Chinese governments support industrial policy research and analysis . The USG does not , and its economic statistics and technology system is designed to support market analysis and business cycle management , not power industry policy . And of course , every year , this system gets weaker with budget cuts . China also has a multitude of different agencies and bureaus to implement power industry policies . And we see that with the range of sophisticated techno-industrial policies , including China ’ s large and well-funded network of manufacturing innovation centers . [ 48 ] The United States has barely a few , some at the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) and DOD , but that is about it . Eighth , China sees itself in great power industry competition . Party congresses focus on this . Party newspapers constantly discuss it . Chinese leaders constantly discuss it . The United States largely does not . Most of the U.S. trade experts see trade as Ricardian win-win with countries not competing with each other . Trade policy is to reduce barriers to let markets become more efficient . To the extent elites consider U.S. competitiveness , most believe that we are far ahead of the Chinese and always will be because market economies produce superior outcomes compared with state-directed economies . Or , like Paul Krugman and so many other conventional economists , they deny that the United States competes at all with other economies . Hot-button issues of abortion , immigration , culture wars , health care , and the like , as well as inflation and stock prices , take up the attention of most U.S. policymakers . Ninth , Chinese officials are pragmatic . If letting companies have more leeway achieves CCP goals , they are for it . If winning requires more state involvement or even control , they are for that . In contrast , it is U.S. officials who are the ideologues . The CHIPS Act is opposed by the Right because it is too much government involvement . The Left opposes it because it commits the sin of helping corporations . Trump ’ s efforts to take equity share in companies are opposed , not because it might not lead to increased national power , but because it violates free-market principles . This ideological nature of U.S. thinking is why so many U.S. experts disparage China , as well as the very need for national power industries . If national power industries are important and if China is outperforming the United States , that poses a direct challenge to current trade and economic ideologies . This is why so many pundits have been arguing that we have seen “ Peak China. ” That way “ nothing to see here , move on. ” No need to do the painful examination of whether our current system works or needs a historic transformation . But Peak China is a fantasy ; nothing could be farther than the truth . The demographic challenge they point to won ’ t really kick in for another decade or so as smaller , younger cohorts move into mid-career roles . Besides , there is every reason to expect that Chinese productivity growth will continue to outpace population decline , as well as U.S. growth rates . The same with the housing bubble-induced fiscal crisis . That is a business cycle challenge , not a growth challenge . Brooks and Vagle dismiss China ’ s techno-economic challenge because U.S. companies account for a larger share of global profits than Chinese firms . [ 49 ] But that is misleading for two reasons . U.S. profits overseas , especially in China , provide little in the way of national power . Second , low profits are a CCP tactic that lets Chinese firms gain global market share . Indeed , as a McKinsey Global Institute report points out , “ Simply put , US manufacturing companies are expected to produce higher returns on capital than their competitors in the OECD and China. ” [ 50 ] If national power industries are important and if China is outperforming the United States , that poses a direct challenge to current trade and economic ideologies . Some rightly point out that CCP has its own innovation bottlenecks—constraints in extreme-ultraviolet lithography , gallium nitride substrates , or advanced gene-therapy commercialization—that could limit Beijing ’ s ability to sustain techno-war pressures . There is no question that this is true . China is not all-powerful . But the CCP is making massive efforts to either replace Western capabilities or innovate around them with fundamentally new-to-the-world capabilities . Tenth and finally , China ’ s rulers are much more unified on national goals . While there are divides within the CCP , although they are likely fewer after Xi ’ s purges , the divides are not really about overarching goal . That remains , as China scholar Orville Schell wrote , wealth and power . In this case , the power of being a rich global hegemon dominating advanced industries . [ 51 ] Any differences are about how to achieve that goal , with XI and his faction focused more on techno-economic aggression while any reformers still left focused on using slightly less aggressive policies so as to reduce Western pushback . There used to be more unanimity around U.S. national goals , which changed and emerged after each major historical pivot . In his book Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy , Bill Janeway discussed how America had national missions from its founding : the Hamiltonian mission of building the country to be independent of England , the mission from Lincoln to FDR to become a great world industrial power and tying the country together , and the post-World War II Soviet containment mission through military offset technology . [ 52 ] During the Cold War , there was broad-based bipartisan consensus about not letting the Soviets win , with some seeking a Kenan-like containment and others seeking a Reagan-like victory . But the goal was the same . Today , America no longer has a unifying national mission or interests to rally around other than , for the Right , freedom , and for the Left ( along with many on the “ New Right , ” such as American Compass ) , equity and redistribution . And for many , the dominant mission now is fighting climate change . For others , it is fighting against the takeover of the world by super AI . And overall , self-interest not only runs amok , but also has become the new civic religion . China doesn ’ t care about any of these matters . It is time for another historical pivot point when America ’ s new national mission becomes not losing the national power industry war to China . Today , America no longer has a unifying national mission or interests to rally around other than , for the Right , freedom , and for the Left , equity and redistribution . As discussed in the next section , there is considerable difference of opinion among U.S. foreign policy experts regarding China ’ s goals , and even fundamental nature , and as such a variety of strategic directions for the United States are offered . To the extent experts acknowledge China ’ s power industry actions , the consensus view is that the CCP is focusing on advanced industries either because they simply want to catch up to the West as any developing nation wants to do or they are reacting to Trump ’ s trade aggression and therefore are seeking to legitimately derisk from the United States . Likewise , the consensus view is that the CCP is seeking a seat at the global table in order to influence global issues . Finally , many experts see the CCP as being more capitalist than communist , and that , as such , it is more of a “ normal ” country than a Marxist-Leninist one . There are two principal problems with the consensus view . First , the view is likely wrong , stemming from a combination of wishful thinking and long-term intellectual commitments to positions held years if not decades ago but are now outdated . The view that the CCP is truly a Marxist-Leninist regime seeking to be the global hegemon and impose its governance structure on the world is actually likely to be the more accurate one . Second , even if the odds are that the consensus view is the correct one , especially that China is not seeking power industry dominance , it leads to a set of policies that , if right , can lead to an adequate outcome , but if wrong , to U.S. decline and subservience . If this is the case , it makes the struggle for global advanced industry leadership not only more important , but also central to the outcome . Finally , some believe that China has no desire or interest in having its power industry firms replace U.S. ( and allied ) power industry firms because then the CCP would have no leverage over our firms because there would be vastly fewer firms that buy from China . But this misses the point . The point is CCP leverage over the nation as a whole , and if it controls power industries , it has enormous power over Western nations . To better understand the CCP , we can look both at what the CCP says , especially domestically , and what the CCP does in terms of its national power industries ’ policies . Ultimately , only time will tell which view is correct . But one insight into which is correct—China as a normal developing country or China as a hegemonic Marxist-Leninist regime set on global dominance of national power industries—is to review CCP writings and speeches . As Charles Parton wrote for the U.K. Council on Geostrategy : Internally , when promulgating to its members the speeches of Xi Jinping , General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) , party documents and instructions , the CCP speaks of an ideological struggle between systems in which the People ’ s Republic of China ( PRC ) will gain domination over the United States ( US ) . Externally , its foreign propaganda system derides the notion of a new cold war , and speaks of ‘ win-win ’ or ‘ a community with a shared future for mankind… The second narrative is what it puts out to party members for guidance and reassurance . It is this which better represents its true intentions and therefore to which foreign governments should pay attention . [ 53 ] Perhaps the best analysis of these documents and statements comes from Daniel Tobin , professor of Practice at the U.S. National Intelligence University . In a May 7 , 2025 , article entitled “ The Persistent , Soaring Ambitions of Xi Jinping ’ s ‘ New Era ’ for China , Socialism , and the Globe , ” Tobin analyzed party documents , including Xi Jinping speeches and statements . [ 54 ] He wrote : In recent years , a growing number of external observers have rediscovered the value of CCP leadership speeches and policy documents as a vehicle for understanding the PRC ’ s intentions and actions . This is indeed the correct starting place . Owing to the CCP ’ s Leninist heritage , it uses ideology expressed in these venues as its instrument to depict , modify , and mobilize around its long-term goals , view of the external environment , and the policies designed to navigate toward its objectives . [ 55 ] His analysis suggests that the U.S. consensus view of China is wrong , and that indeed the CCP is a Marxist-Leninist party intent on advancing socialism globally against Western capitalism and democracy . He quoted Chinese Leader Xi : “ The very purpose of the Party in leading the Chinese people in revolution , development , and reform is to make the people prosperous and the country strong , and rejuvenate the Chinese nation. ” Parton added : Since 1992 , the CCP ’ s constitution has maintained that : “ The general starting point and criteria for judging each item of the Party ’ s work are that it must benefit the development of the socialist productive forces , be conducive to increasing socialist China ’ s comprehensive national power , and help to improve the people ’ s living standards. ” Comprehensive national power , then , is both an end and a means to achieving the PRC ’ s overall goal of “ national rejuvenation ” become “ a country with leading comprehensive national power and international influence. ” In other words , the goal is not just to become a developed , modern strong country in absolute terms , but also a leading country in comparison with others . [ 56 ] But the consensus view is that China just wants to be strong , just as any large developing country wants to be . But Tobin disagreed : Indeed , while some external observers have rushed to point out that the official translation says a global leader not the global leader , it strains credibility that , already seeing itself as the number two power in the world as measured in computations of comprehensive national power , Beijing ’ s goal could be to work hard for several decades only to remain number two . In specific areas of international competition including economics , science and technology , innovation , and military capabilities , Xi repeatedly talks about “ seizing the initiative , ” and for and the need for China not to miss another historical opportunity to assume leadership . Indeed , a 2021 People ’ s Daily editorial under the pseudonym “ Manifesto ” ( 宣言 ) , which Beijing has used several times to express the ambitions of the new era , maintains that “ Gaining the upper hand in the competition of comprehensive national power is the key to national rejuvenation. ” [ 57 ] He then wrote : Yet from Washington ’ s standpoint it ought to matter that Xi has been relentlessly consistent in framing the PRC as engaged in a systems contest with capitalism , where the CCP ’ s ability to navigate China to the status of the leading country in the world has implications for the rivalry between socialism and capitalism . [ 58 ] In his 19th Party Congress speech , Xi famously declared about the new era : It means that scientific socialism is full of vitality in 21st century China , and that the banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics is now flying high and proud for all to see . It means the path , the theory , the system , and the culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics have kept developing , blazing a new trail for other developing countries to achieve modernization . It offers a new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence : and it offers Chinese wisdom and a Chinese approach to solving the problems facing humanity . [ 59 ] Tobin went on to argue that “ Xi Jinping , from his first days in office , has continued to underline these arguments for remaining committed to socialism ; yet he also returned to the arguments about socialism ’ s inevitable international triumph that had not been emphasized since the Mao era. ” [ 60 ] What is troubling is that most U.S. foreign policy experts don ’ t seem to take Xi seriously , assuming that he is simply mouthing Marxist-Leninist platitudes for the party faithful and doesn ’ t really mean it . This may be in part because they believe that only countries such as North Korea and the former Soviet Union are/were really Marxist . For them , “ socialism with Chinese characteristics ” is a slogan the CCP proselytizes to pacify the masses . Most U.S. foreign policy experts don ’ t seem to take Xi seriously , assuming that he is simply mouthing Marxist-Leninist platitudes for the party faithful and doesn ’ t really mean it . For them , “ socialism with Chinese characteristics ” is a slogan the CCP proselytizes to pacify the masses . Yet , as Tobin wrote , “ In what would become a famous speech to party cadres at the provincial and ministerial level in early January 2013 , underscoring the party ’ s commitment to the socialist project , Xi frames the contest as one of systems rivalry with capitalism , a contest in which China is behind but will catch-up. ” [ 61 ] Tobin recounts that Xi stated : Reality has proved again and again that Karl Marx and Frederick Engels ’ analysis of the fundamental contradiction in capitalist society is not obsolete , nor is the viewpoint of historical materialism that capitalism is doomed to failure and socialism will prevail . It is an irreversible trend of social development , but the process will be tortuous . It will be a long process that leads to the demise of capitalism and the victory of socialism . We must understand in depth the self-regulating capacity of capitalist society and fully recognize the objective reality that developed Western countries will dominate the economic , scientific , technological and military fields for a long time . We must prepare ourselves for long-term cooperation and rivalry between the two social systems… . The most important thing is that we focus on our development to increase our comprehensive national power , improve our people ’ s lives , and develop socialism that has more strengths than capitalism , so as to lay a solid foundation for us to seize the initiative , win the competitive edge , and secure our future . Our continued success in adapting Marxism to the Chinese context and the needs of our times has enabled Marxism to take on a fresh face in the eyes of the world , and significantly shifted the worldwide historical evolution of the contest between the two different ideologies and social systems of socialism and capitalism in a way that favors socialism . Tobin went on to note , “ Further , Beijing maintained , owing to the PRC ’ s success , Xi Jinping Thought is : ‘ the Marxism of contemporary China and of the 21st century ’ . ” [ 62 ] What could be clearer than this ? The key point of Tobin ’ s argument is thus : The thumbnail depiction common among US based China specialists that describes Beijing ’ s goals as ‘ regional dominance and global influence ’ undersells and does not comport with either Xi Jinping Thought or the PRC ’ s actions . On the contrary , Beijing has made it clear under Xi Jinping that it seeks a place of global leadership where the PRC ’ s proposed solutions to global problems and vision for the global order prevail… . Beijing makes clear that attaining the CCP ’ s objectives for the Chinese nation requires the construction of the global order along the lines the CCP favors . 103 It is risky to ignore the written words laying out the foreign policy goals of dictators , as Stalin learned to his dismay with Adolph Hitler , who in 1925 laid out in Mein Kampf ( My Struggle ) his goals of Lebensraum ( living space ) in the east and destroying Soviet communism . This is not simple economic competition , the frame that U.S. analysts , including economists , embrace . This is conflict between adversaries . As this all relates to national power industries , Tobin wrote , “ The PRC further sees these technological frontiers as both an opportunity to seize the leading global position and shape how emerging norms and standards are set. ” [ 63 ] And this is not simple economic competition , the frame that U.S. analysts , including economists , embrace . This is conflict between adversaries . Tobin also wrote that Xi “ talks about the “ great struggle ” ( a CCP euphemism for the systems contest with Western capitalist democracy ) , and trumpets “ We must maintain strategic confidence and strengthen our fighting spirit. ” [ 64 ] In summary , Tobin wrote : We ought to be able to put to bed suggestions that Beijing ’ s ambitions for its place in the world are regional ( with merely “ global influence ” as the goal ) . Rather , the CCP ’ s vision is that its ideas and solutions become the foundation for the future global order and underpin the future of a deeply interconnected world and the future development of humanity as a whole . If there remained any doubts about the scope of US-PRC strategic rivalry , the 20th Party Congress and its aftermath should have answered them . [ 65 ] Charles Parton , a former British diplomat , made similar points . He wrote that , to replace the United States as the world ’ s leading superpower : [ T ] he CCP under Xi sees itself engaged in a fierce ‘ struggle ’ against ‘ hostile foreign forces ’ . For all its accusations that ‘ certain countries ’ are guilty of a ‘ cold war mentality ’ , the CCP itself is in no doubt that this is a cold war— and an ideological one . As Xi has said , ‘ competition between systems is an important aspect of competition for comprehensive national power ’ , and the dominance of a system gives a country the dominant position in winning the ‘ strategic initiative. ’ [ 66 ] He went on to quote one CCP official : “ International struggles are becoming increasingly fierce , and system confrontation has become a prominent feature of the game between major powers . The US suppression [ of us ] is a major threat but [ our struggle with the US ] is both a skirmish and a protracted war. ” [ 67 ] He cited another CCP official with a similar tone of belligerency : “ The strategic contest between China and the United States is bound to last for a long period of time , for which we must be fully prepared ideologically and work. ” [ 68 ] He discussed how the minister of Science and Technology wrote in the People ’ s Daily , the CCP ’ s newspaper : [ T ] he scientific and technological revolution and the contest between major powers are intertwined ; the high-tech field has become the forefront and main battlefield of international competition , profoundly influencing the global order and development pattern…the competition between countries is a competition of strength . What is crucial is the competition of scientific and technological innovation capabilities . The underlying contest is about whose system is superior . [ 69 ] As such , the CCP sees technology as a core component of national power . Parton went on to discuss how : Influential commentaries and articles in party media at the time of the First Session of the 14th NPC in 2023 made that point clearly : To a certain extent , those who gain access to the internet will gain the world . Seizing the historical opportunity of the information revolution is a major strategic decision related to the construction of a strong country and national rejuvenation . Core technology is an important weapon for the country….Only by holding key core technologies in our own hands can we fundamentally guarantee national economic security , national defence security , and other security . [ 70 ] In “ A Vision of Success in the U.S.-China Rivalry : The Technological Competition , ” Michael J. Mazarr , senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation , wrote : There can be little doubt that Beijing aims to be the unquestioned global leader in a whole series of science- and technology-based industries , from 5G and renewable energy to electric vehicles and biotechnology . ( In parallel , it is seeking dominance in less technologically cutting-edge industries such as shipbuilding . ) How precisely China defines success in these terms is not clear , although in some cases , such as solar panels , it has achieved something close to a global monopoly position in manufacturing , and in 5G China was apparently seeking to position Huawei similarly as the overwhelmingly dominant global actor . This position of technological overmatch would consequently provide Beijing with tremendous leverage in its broader effort to achieve global leadership . China ’ s favored end state in the technology competition therefore envisions overall supremacy in many critical fields , all of which can be employed for broader geostrategic effect . [ 71 ] We see this focus on influence and struggle in terms of how the CCP conceives of industry . Whereas U.S. thinkers see economic policy as enabling allocation efficiency with no other industry more important than another , CCP officials have a different view . An interview with Lu Feng , a leading professor at Peking University ’ s School of Government , specializing in industrial policy , technological innovation , and development , gives a sense of this difference . [ 72 ] In the interview , cross-posted in the Substacks High Capacity and Sinification , Feng argues that China needs even more industrial development because it is a “ strategic asset. ” [ 73 ] According to interviewers Kyle Chan and colleagues , “ Lu Feng argues that China ’ s industrial base is its ‘ greatest source of strength ” and a ” strategic asset ” akin to U.S. dollar hegemony or Russian oil and gas. ” [ 74 ] Professor Wang Yu of the Nanjing University Business School said the same in March : The essence of competition among major countries is scientific and technological competition ... The strategic value of strategic emerging industries and future industries lies in their fundamental impact on the future industrial status of various countries , reshape the international division of labor , and enhance national discourse power . [ 75 ] Whereas U.S. thinkers see economic policy as enabling allocation efficiency with no other industry more important than another , CCP officials have a different view . The CCP laid out its game plan in China ’ s Made in China : 2025 plan that calls for China to become a global advanced manufacturing “ powerhouse. ” [ 76 ] The plan stated : Since the beginning of industrial civilization in the middle of the 18 th century , the history of the rise and fall of world powers and the history of the struggle of the Chinese nation has repeatedly proved that without a strong manufacturing industry , there will be no country and no nation . Building an internationally competitive manufacturing industry is the only way China can enhance its comprehensive national strength , ensure national security , and build itself into a world power . It must look to the world , step up strategic deployment , focus on building a manufacturing powerhouse , shore up its roots , and turn challenges into opportunities to seize the commanding heights of a new round of competition in the manufacturing industry . By the 100th anniversary of the founding of New China , the country ’ s status as a manufacturing industry power must be consolidated , and its comprehensive strength must enter the forefront of the world ’ s manufacturing powerhouses . The main areas of the manufacturing industry must be innovation-led with obvious competitive advantages , and we will build a world-leading technology system and industrial system . China ’ s National 13th Five-Year Plan for the Development of Strategic Emerging Industries also gives several indication of the CCP ’ s intention dominate power industries , including : Industry innovation capabilities must rank first globally , forming first-mover advantages in several major sectors . By 2020 , … the self-sufficiency rate for major key materials reaches over 70 % to initially realize the strategic transformation of China from materials power to materials superpower . Promote domestic enterprises and Chinese-foreign enterprises in jointly developing international markets , support the “ going global ” of the supply chain to feed high-quality assets , technology , and management experience from “ going global ” back to China and form comprehensive competitive advantages . [ 77 ] Chan wrote : The US-China rivalry ultimately as a contest between two systems : China ’ s “ industrial socialism ” and America ’ s “ financial capitalism. ” The US was once an industrial powerhouse like China today with half of global production and an “ arsenal of democracy ” that changed the course of World War II . But , in a critique with strong political resonance within the US , Lu Feng says the US economy became increasingly “ financialized , ” dominated by the short-term interests of Wall Street investors , causing America ’ s industrial base to atrophy . In contrast , China ’ s socialist system ensured that financial resources would be directed toward supporting the “ real economy ” and steer China away from the standard path of deindustrialization . [ 78 ] China is working on a Made in China : 2035 plan that aims to surpass the United States in all advanced production industries . Lu Yongxiang , former vice-chairman of the National People ’ s Congress , in a commentary published in 2024 in the “ Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering ” stated , “ It is estimated that by 2035 , ‘ Made in China ’ will surpass the United States and become the global leader. ” [ 79 ] He went on to note , “ ‘ Irreversible US production declines amid an expanding Chinese economy will thrust world into a new era. ” Note “ U.S . declines ” and “ new era. ” The CCP knows that its effort to lead the world can not come without absolute U.S. decline in advanced industries . And the new era refers to an era in which China is dominant . And as Xi Jinping has stated , “ Technological innovation has become the main battleground of the global playing field , and competition for tech dominance w ill grow unprecedentedly fierce. ” [ 80 ] Note the terms “ battlefield ” and “ dominance. ” Likewise , as a CCP report titled “ General Laws of the Rise of Great Powers ” states , “ Becoming a major manufacturing power provides crucial security for the goal of realizing the Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation. ” [ 81 ] In an article in state-run publication , the author wrote : ‘ Advancing Chinese-style Modernization Requires Handling Several Major Relationships Well , ’ General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out the need to ‘ strengthen national strategic scientific and technological capabilities , guided by national strategic needs , focus on original and leading scientific and technological research , and resolutely win the battle to overcome key core technologies . [ 82 ] Likewise , in the CCP-controlled publication Peoples Forum , Wei Ziping , a teacher at the School of Public Administration and Law , Anhui University of Technology , wrote in 2023 that China needs to “ accelerate progress toward our goal of leading the world in key core technologies , build China into a global power in science and technology , expand the space for Chinese-style modernization through institutionalized , high-level openness and cooperation , and realize the Chinese Dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. ” [ 83 ] One leading Chinese scholar spoke at a major conference , “ The competition for the Fourth Industrial Revolution will be held between China and the US . But America also suffers from the diseases of neoliberal politics . Its prospects are not bright . For China this once-in-a-century race is an opportunity. ” [ 84 ] Former Deputy National Security Advisor Matt Pottinger describes a meeting during the first Trump administration with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing : Addressing Trump from across the table , Premier Li painted a menacing picture of the not-so-distant future . China , he said , would completely dominate this century ’ s most important technologies , including artificial intelligence . The world would become more dependent on China than ever before . The United States , Li said , was destined to export little more to China than soybeans and corn . To add insult to injury , Li said Beijing would purchase substitutes for U.S. agriculture if the Communist regime was unhappy with Washington for one reason or another . [ 85 ] Maybe this was bluster , or maybe he was turning over this cards to show the CCP ’ s hand . Either way , there is increasing evidence that China is preparing for a major external crisis ; what Xi calls “ extreme-case ” situations , or “ jiduan qingkuang. ” Whether that is war , we do not know . [ 86 ] What Rand Scholar Jimmy Goodrich calls China ’ s “ fortress economy ” involves both defense and offense . [ 87 ] None of this is the language of nation seeking to just move up the development ladder ; it is language of power and domination . [ 88 ] The CCP knows that its effort to lead the world can not come without absolute U.S. decline in advanced industries . And the new era refers to an era in which China is dominant . CCP leaders are savvy enough to not explicitly show their hand , at least in venues that Westerners are likely to come across . After many nations expressed alarm , CCP officials understood that they were in error when they were so explicit about their goals for industrial power in Made in China : 2025 . Shortly thereafter , Chinese leaders quietly dropped most if not all references to it , even as they doubled down on its implementation . [ 89 ] But that does not mean that it is still not their strategy . The title of Rush Doshi ’ s book , The Long Game : China ’ s Grand Strategy to Displace American Order , says it all . This is not just about China rising , but also about China displacing the United States and other Western leaders , and the techno-economic battlefield is where much of the conflict will be fought . He writes that China ’ s strategy is to displace the United States , including in the techno-economic sphere , and it uses predatory practices to accomplish that . [ 90 ] U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a report when he was the chair of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship , concluding that China was doing more than “ breaking the rules ” to dominate high-value industrial sectors . [ 91 ] This helps explain why , despite a highly polarized political climate , Congress managed to pass the CHIPS and Science Act , which invests billions of dollars to support new semiconductor factories in the United States . Nothing promotes unity like a shared and frightening enemy . In a report for the Hoover Institution— “ Economic Statecraft : The Need For An Integrated Approach ” —H.R . McMaster and Andrew Grotto discussed the need for the USG to “ exercise broad discretion to intervene in the economy to address a threat emanating from overseas ( e.g . China ) . ” [ 92 ] It rightly argues : US administrations consistently undervalue the degree to which strategic application of economic power is essential for advancing US vital interests…The United States must act to counter Chinese economic aggression—nonmarket actions intended to harm American companies , impair US manufacturing , or coerce the United States and its allies . [ 93 ] In Getting China Wrong , Princeton University scholar Aaron Friedberg argued that : Growth and development have not caused China ’ s rulers to relax their grip on political power , abandon their mercantilist economic policies , or accept the rules and norms of the existing international system . To the contrary : China today is more repressive at home , more aggressive abroad , and more obviously intent on establishing itself as the world ’ s preponderant power than at any time since the death of Chairman Mao . Likewise , as Fredberg noted , “ The key to understanding Xi ’ s economic policies is to recognize that they are principally about power , not prosperity . He will almost certainly forge ahead toward concentrating the world ’ s industrial power within China. ” [ 94 ] He went to write : Rather than letting the free play of market forces and the principle of comparative advantage determine the international distribution of industrial capacity , it seeks deliberately to build “ national champions , ” helping them to acquire and “ indigenize ” critical technologies and supporting their efforts to dominate domestic and global markets for cutting-edge products . [ 95 ] Finally , an anonymous author of an Atlantic Council report entitled “ The Longer Telegram ” warned that implementing an effective China strategy would “ require a firm understanding of Xi ’ s strategic objectives , which include the following : leapfrog the United States as a technological power and thereby displace it as the world ’ s dominant economic power. ” [ 96 ] China follows a predictable playbook for trying to dominate advanced industries . Even with what should be compelling evidence of the CCP ’ s intent , there will be those who say that these words are for internal consumption and don ’ t reflect the CCP ’ s external goals . Or that these translations make subtle but important mistakes that distort meaning . To those , I would argue , look at what the CCP has been doing . China follows a predictable playbook for trying to dominate advanced industries . The first step is to attract foreign investment . In the early 1980s , when Deng Xiaoping opened up the Chinese economy to foreign investment , his main economic development strategy sought principally to induce foreign multinationals to shift relatively low- and moderate-value production to China . [ 97 ] China is still trying to do that today with emerging industries , seeking , for example , to attract global biopharmaceutical companies to build facilities in China . China ’ s second step is to attempt to learn from foreign companies , in part by having them train Chinese executives , scientists , and engineers , and also by forced technology transfer , including through joint ventures . In 2015 , 6,000 new international joint ventures , amounting to $ 27.8 billion in foreign direct investment ( FDI ) inflows , were established in China . [ 98 ] And the sophistication and value of the technology the Chinese government has demanded is high . As the United States Trade Representative ’ s ( USTR ’ s ) Office pointed out in its 2018 Special 301 report on China , pressures on U.S. companies to form joint ventures and transfer technology “ is particularly intense. ” [ 99 ] Figure 1 : 1958 CCP poster exhorting Chinese workers and companies to “ surpass Britain in 15 years ” in industrial production [ 100 ] The third step is to support Chinese companies in their efforts to copy and incorporate foreign technology while building up domestic capabilities . One important marker for the transition from stage two to stage three was the publication in 2006 of the “ National Medium- and Long-term Program for Science and Technology Development ( 2006–2020 ) , ” which called on China to master 402 core technologies—everything from intelligent automobiles to integrated circuits and high-performance computers . China moved to a “ China Inc. ” development model of indigenous innovation , which focused on helping Chinese firms , especially those in advanced , innovation-based industries , often at the expense of foreign firms . The fourth step is to enable Chinese firms to become independent innovators . China is attempting to do this through an array of plans and policies : “ 13th Five-Year Plan for Science and Technology , ” “ 13th Five-Year Plan for National Informatization , ” “ The National Cybersecurity Strategy , ” and “ Made in China 2025 Strategy , ” and most recently Xi Jinping ’ s call at the 20th Party Congress for “ invigorating China through science and education ... for the strategy of innovation-driven development . ” [ 101 ] A key part of this step is to squeeze out the foreign companies that they had initially invited in . The Chinese market essentially becomes dominated by Chinese-owned firms . We have seen this an array of industries , including chemicals , telecom equipment , heavy construction equipment , high-speed rail , and renewable energy . The CCP then carves out and preserves the Chinese market for Chinese firms . For example , the Chinese government included 57 domestic auto battery makers in the catalog , meaning that foreign giants such as Samsung , LG , and Panasonic were excluded . [ 102 ] This demonstrates how China protects its domestic champions while they build capacity for international expansion . The final step is to then support these companies “ going out ” and taking market share in other parts of the world . Unfortunately , for gaining political support for a robust U.S. strategy to respond to China , the United States is among the last places Chinese firms will seek to enter . Rather , they are going after market share in places such as Latin America , Southeast Asia , Africa , and Eastern Europe , the “ soft underbelly ” of global markets . As their firms gain market share , Western—including U.S.—firms , lose market share , and tipping points can happen quite quickly . China backs this all up by massive subsidies to its industries . Firms often have to compete in “ unfair ” markets , if only because many factors affect the value of currency . Hence , firms can find themselves with an uncompetitive cost structure in global markets even though they are doing everything right . But leaving this aside , firm competition plays out through several key factors , with price and quality being the most important . If one firm is provided subsidies ( including a devalued currency ) , it has—all else equal—a competitive advantage over its foreign competitors that receive limited subsidies . The firm can use that advantage to cut prices and gain market share . It can boost its scale and learning economies . Or it can invest those subsidies in R & D and other areas to boost quality and innovation , again taking market share from its competitors . China ’ s subsidies are on steroids because of the intense competition for industry between its cities and provinces , which shell out massive funds to support local champions . And it ignores the supposed WTO disciplines on subsidies . While a number of nations have relied on many forms of subsidies ( low corporate taxes , tax incentives , grants , subsidized costs of inputs such as energy , and a suppressed value of their currency ) , by and large , the scale of the subsidies is usually limited , often by domestic political pressures from voters demanding lower taxes or higher spending to directly benefit them . At the same time , many Western nations implement various subsidy-limitation measures because they want competition to be on a level playing field . But China is exempt from all of those limitations . China ’ s subsidies are on steroids , in part because of the intense competition for industry between its cities and provinces , which shell out massive funds to support local champions . And China flouts the flaccid WTO disciplines on subsidies . The magnitude and extent of Chinese subsidies have been widely documented . Though dated , Haley and Haley ’ s book Chinese Industrial Subsidies documents just how sizeable these were and the role they played in enabling China to gain global market share in the 2000s . More recently , Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) found , “ Even using a conservative methodology , China ’ s industrial policy spending is enormous , totaling at least 1.73 percent of GDP in 2019 . This is equivalent to more than $ 248 billion at nominal exchange rates and $ 407 billion at purchasing power parity exchange rates. ” [ 103 ] A new study from a German institute estimates , “ Overall , industrial subsidies in China are several times higher than those in large EU and OECD countries . The size of the estimated difference ranges from a ratio of at least three to four in conservative estimates to a ratio of as high as nine in more encompassing studies. ” [ 104 ] In 2022 , 99 percent of listed firms in China received direct government subsidies . For example , the German study finds that Chinese EV maker BYD has received over $ 3.7 billion in subsidies . Overall , in 2019 , Chinese industrial subsidies were 4.5 times greater than the United States as a share of GDP , and that is accounting for the U.S. subsidies related to national defense and government support for scientific research . [ 105 ] Hand in hand with subsidies are market access restrictions . The first directly helps a domestic company gain market share ; the second helps indirectly by reducing the market share of a foreign competitor and increasing that domestic firm ’ s share . For example , when the Chinese government tells its state-owned telecom providers to stop using American computer chips in their systems , it weakens companies such as Intel and AMD while strengthening Chinese companies such as SMIC . China ’ s massive size means that it an and is seeking competitive advantage in every technology , current and emerging . In comparison , Japan in the 1980s and 1990s sought and gained advantage in significantly fewer sectors ( e.g. , consumer electronics , steel , autos , and chemicals ) . This size also means that because China manages its market and limits foreign sales once its firms get to a certain scale , Chinese firms are blessed with massive , largely secure market revenues , and this includes massive government subsidies . In addition , the scope of state power to punish foreign firms and favor domestic ones is unprecedented . By cutting off foreign firms ( or reducing their China revenue ) while bestowing lavish benefits on its own firms , Chinese firms are able to sell below cost for many years , if not decades , all with the goal of taking market share away from global leaders . Japanese firms also did that , but to a much more limited extent . China ’ s massive size means that it can and is seeking competitive advantage in every technology , current and emerging . In comparison , Japan in the 1980s and 1990s sought and gained advantage in significantly fewer sectors . One reason why international trade theory holds that low-wage countries won ’ t dominate global trade because of their low costs is that they also have low productivity . Thus , when pundits warn that the United States can ’ t compete with low-wage nations because of our higher labor costs , they are ignoring the fact that what matters is productivity-adjusted labor costs . And it is a normal pattern of development that labor costs in virtually all countries tend to track labor productivity quite closely . According to Claude AI , there is a 0.88 correlation between labor costs and national labor productivity , just as we would expect . The average ratio of wages to productivity for 42 countries is 0.51 , and in the United States it is 0.53 , whereas in China it is just 0.24 . In other words , if Chinese wages were half of Chinese productivity levels , as is the case in virtually all other nations , then wages in China would be twice as high , significantly reducing its competitive advantage in global markets . One recent study examined five manufacturing industries , including electric vehicles , shipbuilding , and steel and argued that for a variety of reasons the Chinese government undercounts industry productivity . [ 106 ] The author found that physical output per worker averaged 2.4 times higher than U.S. output per worker , and value-added per worker was 20 percent higher , on average . Assuming that the value-added measure is a more accurate , apples-to-apples comparison , this means that China ’ s cost-to-productivity ratio is between 6 and 12 times greater than the U.S. ratio , given that Chinese workers earn around 20 percent of U.S. workers ’ wages in dollar terms . This suggests that China is breaking the historical model for developing nations , where wages track productivity . The PRC is making sure that the benefits of productivity don ’ t go to Chinese workers but rather to foreign consumers who can buy cheaper products , with the goal of driving foreign producers out of business . This is consistent with a longstanding CCP pattern of giving short shrift to nonmanufacturing productivity growth and instead maintaining a laser-like focus on raising productivity in manufacturing . While up-to-date quantitative data is not available , it is clear that China is doubling down on this approach in manufacturing . ITIF has calculated that , in 2021 , China had 12 times more robots in use per manufacturing worker as did the United States when controlling for wage levels ( higher-wage nations should have more robots than should low-wage nations ) . [ 107 ] In 2022 , China had 59 percent more robots per manufacturing worker than did the United States . [ 108 ] And it installed more robots than the rest of the world combined did . [ 109 ] It is encouraging highly automated factories , including so-called “ dark factories ” with very few workers . This suppression of manufacturing labor costs coupled with acceleration of manufacturing productivity through automation appears to be gaining in focus in China , and is a powerful weapon for gaining global market share . The PRC is making sure that the benefits of productivity don ’ t go to Chinese workers but rather to foreign consumers who can buy cheaper products , with the goal of driving foreign producers out of business . As noted , the CCP knows that if it clearly articulates its techno-economic war strategy that it will mobilize both defensive and offensive reaction from the West . And so , of course , it does not . But one way we can get a sense of it is by examining China ’ s global business expansion strategy . If China were only focused on gaining self-reliance from the United States it would be much less focused on gaining global market share . China ’ s “ Going Out ” ( 走出去 ) policy is a comprehensive government strategy launched in the early 2000s to encourage Chinese companies to expand internationally . The government encouraged companies to “ go further outwards ” ( Jinyibu zouchuqu ) in its 11th Five-Year Plan ( 2006–2010 ) . Government policies encouraged Chinese state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) and private enterprises to pursue investments in markets around the world , resulting in the internationalization of SOEs . The government specifically uses SOEs as vehicles for international expansion , providing them with preferential treatment and resources . China ’ s sovereign funds have also supported efforts to Go Out , including by helping Chinese enterprises finance mergers and acquisitions abroad . In 2015 , for example , China Investment Corporation turned one of its divisions into the wholly owned subsidiary CIC Capital . This provided Chinese companies with massive capital backing for overseas acquisitions . And of course , its Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) represents the most ambitious manifestation of the Going Out strategy . In the first 10 years of the initiative ( 2013–2023 ) , China inked roughly $ 1 trillion worth of investment and construction deals with BRI countries [ 110 ] Between 2000 and 2022 , Chinese financiers committed to lending or donating $ 1.34 trillion to low- and medium-income countries—nearly $ 800 billion of this was in the first decade of the BRI from 2013 to 2022 . [ 111 ] The Chinese state is the underwriter for the initiative , via its four state-owned banks lending to SOEs . [ 112 ] At the same time , PRC banks provide vastly more support for foreign investment than do USG institutions . [ 113 ] Box 2 : Chinese Competition and American Deindustrialization : A Financial Framework [ 114 ] Different financial systems help determine the outcomes of the techno-economic war . China ’ s system is designed to aggressively destroys Western company value . The U.S. system is designed to maximize short-term wealth creation and is agnostic toward national industrial power competition . The U.S. Economic Model Publicly traded corporations in capital-intensive sectors ( e.g. , industrials ) optimize three key variables . The first is economic value added ( EVA ) . EVA equals return on invested capital ( ROIC ) minus the weighted Average Cost of Capital ( WACC ) ( ROIC - WACC ) times the amount of invested capital ( IC ) . The weighted average cost of capital for U.S. firms is around 8–10 percent . ROIC equals net operating profit after tax NOPAT divided by invested capital . Profit margins are calculated in various ways . Gross margin is sales minus the cost of goods and production labor . From an industrial standpoint , the most relevant profit margin is the gross margin . The others are influenced by a firm ’ s overhead expenses and its tax , investment , and capital strategy . The U.S. model is more financialized and focus on higher , short-term returns than other capitalist economies . But China is in a completely different model . The Chinese Economic Model Chinese firms systematically generate ROIC well below American WACC thresholds . The Chinese semiconductor firm SMIC , for example , posts approximately 4.5 percent ROIC versus around 12 to 16 percent global semiconductor industry WACC , creating negative EVA by American standards . Chinese EVA = ( 4.5 % - 12 % ) × IC = -7.5 % × IC . In other words , Chinese firms can survive on ROIC that is less than the cost of capital in the United States . This economic value destruction manifests as the “ China price ” —aggressive pricing that destroys gross margins industry-wide . Chinese firms partially compensate through higher capital turns ( sales/IC ) , enabled by rapid market expansion and debt-financed growth . Chinese firms can do this because of overall financial repression in China . The PRC prevents savers from getting normal returns , and its capital controls on foreign investment preclude outside options . Both lower the cost of capital . [ 115 ] At the same time Chinese companies are pressured by the PRC to accept low returns and provided with low-cost capital from state-owned banks in order to gain market share . [ 116 ] American Industrial Response Faced with Chinese “ scorched earth ” competition , U.S. firms can generally only pursue two strategies that make up essentially the mirror image of Chinese value destruction : Strategy 1 : Asset-Light Retrenchment Given this unbeatable competition , one strategy is for U.S. firms to reduce their IC base through outsourcing of production assets to someone else ’ s balance sheet . At the same time , they focus on capital-light activities with higher margins , such as design , sales and market , and software . And they tend to limit expensive investments in capital equipment . Strategy 2 : Cost Reduction for Margin Protection A second strategy is offshore supply chains and production of lower-cost inputs to preserve gross margins . At the same time , they are forced to press for lower prices from domestic suppliers and workers . Capital Allocation Logic : Both of these strategies are additionally supported by a capital strategy that increases earnings per share . In particular , the companies use freed-up cash for share buybacks . Since earnings per share equals Net Income divided by the number of outstanding shares , so EPS can go up with stock buy backs . With Chinese competitors destroying economic value while gaining market share , new productive investments can not be justified . The rational response for these companies is returning cash to investors through share buybacks , inflating EPS even as the industrial base shrinks . Deindustrialization Outcome Both strategies hollow out domestic industrial capacity : Strategy 1 directly reduces the manufacturing base , while Strategy 2 degrades supplier ecosystems and workforce capabilities . The result is a self-reinforcing cycle wherein American firms lose the ability to scale innovation and compete in advanced manufacturing , validating Andy Grove ’ s 2010 warning about the strategic risks of abandoning production competencies . While some populists on the Right and the Left decry U.S. industrial corporations for taking these steps , accusing them of being profit hungry , this is too narrow a focus . The normal rate of capital returns in normal market economies is above 8 to 12 percent , given the cost of capital . No company can survive earning less than the cost of its capital . As such , if these companies tried to do that to meeting the China price , rational shareholders , including labor union pension funds , would invest in other sectors and companies that do not face this constraint , such as insurance and banking , logistics , and entertainment . Rather than engage in emotionally satisfying and politically rewarding hectoring of selfish U.S. capitalists , a better strategy is to limit Chinese scorched earth competition while providing targeted incentives for national power industries to stay in the fight and keep investing . Perhaps the fundamental flaw in the thinking of most in the U.S. foreign policy establishment , including the mass of pundits , journalists , think tank scholars , and academics is their dismissal of the importance of national power industries and lack of understanding of how these industries actually work . Most in the foreign policy establishment are educated in everything but how national power industries work . A random case in point : Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Affairs Masters ’ Program curriculum . Students focus on international relations , regional studies , and language studies . But they also must take a set of courses on international economics . This sounds promising , until looking at the courses : “ [ T ] he Economics I track covers topics in Microeconomics and International Trade Theory , and the Economics II track covers topics in Macroeconomics and International Finance . The Essentials courses are more conceptual in nature and require only basic math skills. ” [ 117 ] As noted , these have almost nothing to do with business strategy , technology development , or industrial policy . Harvard ’ s course list for its international relations master ’ s program includes courses such as “ Globalization and the Nation State ” and “ The Evolution of Deterrence Theory. ” Out of around 50 courses , there is just 1 that might bear on the U.S.-China tech war and that is “ The Geopolitics of Technology , ” but like most of the limited focus in U.S. graduate school International relations , they are on the internet , exploring things like cybersecurity , ethical issues in AI , and cybersecurity. ” [ 118 ] Tuft ’ s Flecther School of Global Affairs seems more promising , offering an entire program on “ Technology and International Affairs ” but it too is focused on the Internet and cyber . [ 119 ] It ’ s International Economic Relations track seems promising , but it is neoclassical international economics , not power economics . Its International Security track is promising , but this is related to military issues , and of course , cyber conflict . Perhaps the fundamental flaw in the thinking of most in the U.S. foreign policy establishment is their dismissal of the importance of national power industries and lack of understanding of how they work . To be sure , these kinds of courses are quite important for being able to effectively study and participate in U.S. international relations , but they have little or nothing to do to prepare the student for understanding the importance of power trade , much less being able to understand what to do . As one distinguished U.S. foreign policy official said to me , “ I wish we had learned technology in the foreign policy establishment , given how central it is now to the field. ” Well , they didn ’ t and therefore they give technology and national power industries short shrift . And we see that in most foreign policy books on China , including the excellent new book by China foreign policy expert George Shambaugh , Breaking the Engagement , where technology is hardly mentioned . They stick with what they know best : diplomacy , foreign policy , great power , competition , human rights , etc . The U.S. foreign policy experts completely ignored the reality , possibility , and success of the Chinese techno-economic war in part because they denied the reality that certain industries provided power . They wanted a relationship that , as Shambaugh wrote , “ would become more stable , productive and manageable . The more threads tying down the relationship like Gulliver , the more impediments there would be to systemic disruption. ” [ 120 ] But what disruption ? For them , disruption meant not talking . They ignored the erosion eating into U.S. national power industry strengths . Pushing back against that would hurt the most important thing : dialogue . If the lion ’ s share of the U.S. foreign policy establishment ignore industry , perhaps with exception of defense contractors and large Internet platforms , the MAGA right loves all industry and wants to reindustrialize America , from baseball mitts to biotechnology . What America needs is a “ third way ” for trade grounded in strategic industry trade policy based on the realization that some industries matter far more than others . The conventional view is that the only industries that matter to national power are defense industries . But that is now vastly too limiting . As Corelli Barnett , wrote , “ For munitions production for modern war is not primarily a question of specialized armament industries , as some suppose , but of all those varied industrial and scientific resources that in peacetime make for a successful and expanding export trade. ” [ 121 ] As such , ITIF has developed a classification of U.S. industries for their relevance to national power . This can be viewed as a continuum between defense industries on one side , nonstrategic industries on the other , and strategic industries and strategic enabling industries in the middle . See figure 2 . Figure 2 : Industrial power scale At one end of the continuum are defense industries . Clearly industries such as ammunition , guided missiles , military aircraft and ships , tanks , drones , defense satellites , and others are strategic . Not having world class innovation and production capabilities in these industries means a weakened military capability . Policymakers across the aisle generally ( with the exception of the isolationist Right and the pacifist Left ) agree that these industries are strategic and that market forces alone will not produce the needed results . At the other end of the spectrum are industries in which the United States has no real strategic interests . These include furniture , coffee and tea manufacturing , bicycles , carpet and rug mills , window and door production , plastic bottle manufacturing , wind turbine production , lawn and garden equipment , sporting goods , jewelry , caskets , toys , toiletries , running shoes , etc . If worst came to worst and our adversaries ( e.g. , China ) gained dominance in any of these industries and decided to cut America off , we ’ d survive—in part , because none of these are critical to the running of the U.S. economy , as many are final goods that might inconvenience consumers but wouldn ’ t cripple any industries , and also because , in most cases , domestic production could be started or expanded relatively easily because none of these products are all that technological complex from either a product or process concern and the barriers to entry are relatively low . Next to defense industries dual-use industries are critical to American strength . Losing aerospace , pharmaceuticals , chemicals , semiconductors , displays , advanced software , fiber optic cable , telecom equipment , machine tools , motors , measuring devices , and other dual-use sectors would give our adversaries incredible leverage over America . Just the threat to cut these off ( assuming that they have also deindustrialized our allies in these sectors ) would immediately bring U.S. policymakers to the bargaining table . National power industries tend to also need global scale in order to complete . Moreover , many are intermediate goods such as semiconductors and chemicals , where a cutoff would cripple many other industries . Finally , these industries are hard to stand up once they ’ re lost because of the complexity of the production process , product knowledge , and the importance of the industrial commons that support them . In other words , barriers to entry are high and , if lost , would be very difficult and expensive to reconstitute . What America needs is a “ third way ” for trade grounded on strategic industry trade policy based on realization that some industries matter far more than others . Finally , there are enabling industries . These are industries wherein , if the United States were cut off , the immediate effects on military readiness would be small . And the U.S. economy could survive for at least a while without production . America could survive for many years without an auto sector , as we would all just drive cars longer . But because of the nature of these industries—including technology development , process innovation , skills , and supporting institutions—their loss would harm both dual-use and defense industries . That is because enabling industries contribute to the industrial commons that support dual-use defense industries . A severely weakened motor vehicle sector would weaken the tank and military vehicle ecosystem . Similarly , a weakened commercial shipbuilding sector has weakened military shipbuilding . A weakened consumer electronics sector weakens military electronics . We can see this in China , whereby the fact that it employs 213 million manufacturing workers , including engineers and technicians , gives it an enormous sophisticated and dynamic production system with synergies and spillovers between enabling industries , national power industries , and defense industries . Indeed , China does not and can not draw firm lines between civil and military industries and technologies , and instead tries to fuse them . In a companion report to this one , ITIF has put the 970 industries classified by the North American Industry Classification codes into the four categories . [ 122 ] Power industries account for 22.3 percent of the industries . ( See figure 3 below and table 2 in the third appendix . ) Most industries are not power industries , in large part because most are nontraded sectors such as law firms and barber shops . Of the 22.3 percent that are power industries , just 0.5 percent are defense industries , and 13.4 percent are dual use . The remaining 8.4 percent are enabling industries . In terms of employment , in 2022 , just 9.5 percent of workers were employed in power industries . Of this , 6.4 percent worked in dual-use industries and 2.9 percent in enabling industries , and just 0.2 percent were employed in defense industries . Figure 3 : Breakdown of six-digit NAICS industries according to ITIF ’ s national power industry typology As such , trade policy should be focused first and foremost on defense , strategic , and enabling sectors and largely ignore nonstrategic . The problem is that Trumpian economic nationalism , at least as represented by some of his key officials , sees all four as equally worth of protection . Why else would Trump fight Canada so hard for dairy and wood products trade , clearly nonpower sectors . Likewise , why else would the administration push so hard for natural gas and farm product exports ? Boosting exports of the former will reduce American fossil fuel resources , while boosting exports of the latter will do little to increase American food security . At the same time , policymakers lack two key insights needed to respond in effective ways . The first is that some industries are strategic . Yet , both political parties have embraced a “ potato chips , computer chips , what ’ s the difference ? ” mentality . The head of one of the leading international economic policy think tanks in Washington said when asked how much manufacturing the United States could lose and still be okay , “ All of it. ” Today , the Trump tariffs are anything but strategic , with the view that the chicken industry is as important as the chip industry . The intent of this project is to change that so that there is a broader consensus around Washington on the criticality of strategic industries for the Republic ’ s future . 1 . Global trade is particularly important in most national power trade industries , particularly dual use . These industries are different in core ways from other industries . Given their high fixed costs relative to marginal costs and the fact that they must reinvest profits to produce the required next round of innovation , firms in these industries require access to global markets . 2 . In addition , firms in these industries are much more susceptible to dying . If CCP competitors can gain enough global market share , they can enter into a virtuous cycle of more revenue , more profits , and more investment in the next round of innovation and so on . Conversely , firms that lose market share risk falling into a death spiral , where they invest less in R & D and new product development and process innovation , and therefore their next rounds of products/services fall behind their competitors , leading to another round of reversal . 3 . Dual-use and defense industries also differ in that they are the engines of national power . To be sure , certain traditional industries , such as steel , are important to national security . However , many traditional industries are largely commodities produced in many countries and are largely available as inputs . Advanced industries are different . Production is concentrated in relatively few countries . Advanced innovation/production ecosystems contribute to and support defense industries . And these industries enable national power to be projected and to defend against adversaries attempting to project their power . Losing aerospace , pharmaceuticals , chemicals , semiconductors , displays , advanced software , fiber optic cable , telecom equipment , machine tools , motors , measuring devices , and other dual-use sectors would give America ’ s adversaries incredible leverage . We have seen the importance of national power industries in history . Case in point , the relative weakness of Great Britain against Germany in both WWI and WWII . The advancement of Germany ’ s broad industrial base , and the atrophy of Britain ’ s , resulted in the latter ’ s relative military weakness , with only the entry of the United States in both wars enabling Britain to escape without military defeat . In his classic book The Collapse of British Power , Corelli Barnett wrote that : it was not the small size and partial decrepitude of Britain ’ s specialized armaments in industry that were mainly responsible for throttling back British armament . For specialized armament firms constitute only a small part of the production of modern war equipment , which is a matter of general industrial resources and technology , especially in all kinds of advanced engineering . It was such general and varied resources that Germany had been able to swiftly convert to producing munitions after 1933 but it was such a resources that Great Britain terribly lacked just as in 1914-15 as the Defence Policy and Requirements Committee had warned in submitting its recommendations for a large scale rearmament in February 1936 : “ The most serious factor in the completion of the proposed program is the limited output of our existing industrial resources . The key to successful completion of the service programs lie in the solution of the industrial problem . [ 123 ] Largely because of the dominant “ liberal ” “ Adam Smithian ” view of the role of government in industrial development , Britain never learned this lesson . After WWII , with the profligacy of the Beveridge-Attlee welfare state , the British once again “ failed to retool the economy before European and Japanese competitors recovered from wartime devastation. ” [ 124 ] For the British , the sad and stark reality is that it was too late for them to do anything meaningful with regard to power industries , even if the British political economy could enable needed action , which it could not . America is not Britain today , but it is Britian in the early 1960s : still a chance to retool but with time slipping by quickly and few political economy resources to take the painful and needed steps . Just as past wars provided the impetus for transformations in American techno-economic and trade regimes , it will be easier for American leaders and pundits to see that we are in a war after war starts . But if China bides its time for a least another decade or two , by then it will be too late , because the odds are Chinese firms will have begun to dominate most power industries . And importantly , once lost , it is virtually impossible to regain competitive position in most national power industries , especially ones that require global economies of scale . America is not Britain today , but it is Britian in the early 1960s : still a chance to retool but with time slipping by quickly and few political economy resources to take the painful and needed steps . The dominant view among most in Washington thinking about this challenge is to either 1 ) be largely unaware of barriers to entry , which would make it difficult if not virtually impossible in some industries for the United States to regain power industry capabilities once lost or 2 ) to believe that it doesn ’ t matter because the United States will just continue to innovate . The prevailing view about competitiveness in Washington is that innovation rains down from above for free , as MIT economist Robert Solow conceived of it , like manna from heaven . [ 125 ] It just is there for the taking . A slightly more sophisticated view is that it just requires a few favorable conditions such as risk-taking entrepreneurs , strong research universities , and venture capital . The fact that the United States is strong in innovation provides an ample intellectual crutch that prevents taking serious national power industry competition and loss . And so the thinking goes that , while it would be nice not to lose these old industries ( old is usually defined as anything that was started 15 to 20 years ago ) , at the end of the day , America will prevail because we can play our innovation card . The Obama administration 2010 National Innovation Strategy summed up the prevailing view from both the Left and the Right : “ Innovation—the process by which individuals and organizations generate new ideas and put them into practice—is the foundation of American economic growth and national competitiveness. ” [ 126 ] And the key to that innovation is “ Competitive markets provide strong incentives for private businesses to improve their products and operations and for capital and labor resources to be reinvested in our best ideas. ” [ 127 ] If that is the case , we should welcome Chinese power industry predation because it ramps up the competitive pressures , providing even stronger pressures for U.S. companies to innovate . A recent article in Issues in Science and Technology , a magazine of the National Academies of Science , agrees : “ We believe that American competitiveness … can be maximized by fostering breakthrough innovations. ” [ 128 ] This is a bit like saying “ small business drives growth ” : both are aphorisms . Who can disagree with either ? One appeal in the United States of an innovation strategy—or for some , an innovation culture—is that it avoids the dreaded “ industrial policy ” and picking winners . The market and plucky entrepreneurs in their garages will create the winners . The role of the government is to stay out of the way , provide them with foreign STEM workers , and keep capital gains taxes low . In an article by Tanner Greer , wherein he developed a typology of strategies on competing with China , he identified dynamists who focus on technology ( rather than more broadly on industry ) and who are skeptical or critical of state capacity : Dynamists are instead focused squarely on deregulating the American economy and reforming the American state . In their eyes , Chinese drone dominance is less a product of Chinese industrial policy than a result of the Federal Aviation Administration ’ s “ war on technology ; ” America ’ s failure to match the stunning new infrastructure of China is best blamed on the National Environmental Policy Act regime ; and cutting-edge developments in AI , crypto , and software engineering would have already transformed the American economy if not for the “ regulatory capture , special interests , and perverse structural incentives ” that have sheltered entrenched incumbents from real competition . [ 129 ] Dynamists live in a narrow world , believing that Silicon Valley is the “ be all and end all ” of technological innovation and that the government has played only a minor role in the Valley ’ s emergence as the world ’ s top technology hub . And for them solving the problem is pretty easy : just get rid of government barriers , such as on immigration , building restrictions , and narrow-minded government management of science . Then our heroic entrepreneurs can ride to the rescue and save us . Eric Schmidt , former CEO of Google , wrote that the United States should spend less time focusing on limiting China . Instead , he wrote : “ If the United States really wants to reindustrialize , it needs to double down on what it does best , including supporting scientific research , enacting immigration policies that welcome the best talent from abroad , and reducing regulatory hurdles. ” [ 130 ] However , there are three key limitations to relying on innovation strategy , from more free market dynamists or more interventionist tech policy advocates , in ensuring U.S. national power industry strength . The first is , by definition , that an innovation strategy is agnostic with respect to power industries . We already see that where there is a growing concern that U.S. venture capital avoids so-called “ deep tech , ” also called “ hard tech. ” These are technologies that tend to be beyond software and the Internet , and require much more capital and engineering capabilities . Most power industries are hard tech . But they require more capital and have higher risks , so the market invests less than needed in them . Perhaps like rolling the dice , risk-taking entrepreneurs and profit-maximizing venture firms might invest in all the areas of power industries the nation needs , but the odds are a bit like rolling snake eyes six times in a row . Second , innovation is only the first step . Power comes from being able to produce and sell the innovation around the world . History is full of examples wherein the United State led on innovation only to have production go overseas , often to foreign companies . These include VHS technology , TVs , LCD displays , solar panels , robotic vacuum cleaners , EV batteries , CNC machine tools , robotics , digital cameras , high-speed rail , digital telecom equipment , LED lighting , carbon fiber , 3D-printing materials , MRI machines , and more . [ 131 ] To be sure , innovation is important ; without it , American power industries would ultimately lose market share . But more innovation without domestic production does not boost national power . If anything , it gives power to China when Chinese companies enter production based on U.S. discoveries , which they all too often steal or otherwise purloin . Third , to the extent innovationists focus only on emerging tech , this misses the boat . Despite all the hype , America can ’ t fight and win wars with only superior AI . Moreover , as noted , power comes also from independence from China in key industries and products . Many of these are not cutting-edge technologies . History is full of examples wherein the United State led on innovation only to have production go overseas , often to foreign companies . Fourth , the idea that deregulation and a more supportive culture are enough to restore U.S. techno-economic power is an ideological fantasy . As discussed ahead , not losing the war will require significant state action , just as not losing U.S. semiconductor capability required public investment ( tax and direct ) , not just an R & D program . Fifth , success relies in part on already having strong existing industries with an innovation ecosystem , which , if we lose , makes innovation harder . Innovation is not just something that happens . Put someone in the middle of nowhere and it ’ s unlikely you will get much innovation . Innovation is enabled by a rich ecosystem that includes existing companies . Indeed , many innovators used to work at large established companies and gained knowledge and connections that enabled them to innovate . The list is endless : Reid Hoffman left PayPal to start LinkedIn , Marc Benioff left Oracle to start Salesforce , Scott McNealy left IBM to cofound Sun Microsystems , Gordon Moore and Jerry Sanders left Fairchild Semiconductor to found Intel and AMD , respectively , and Jensen Huang left AMD/LSI Logic to cofound NVIDIA . It ’ s not just that existing companies are incubators for entrepreneurial founders ; they also support what Shih and Pisano call the “ industrial commons. ” The industrial commons refers to the collective ecosystem of shared resources , infrastructure , specialized skills , and knowledge that enable a region ’ s manufacturing competitiveness and resilience . It encompasses the interconnected network of suppliers , researchers , skilled workers , and development capabilities that , when nurtured together , foster innovation and economic growth within a particular geographic area . As one article asserts , “ A country does not rise to the level of its innovation . It falls to the level of its industrial commons. ” [ 132 ] This is why former Intel CEO Andy Grove stated , perhaps in response to the preposterous claim by economist Alan Blinder that losing the U.S. television industry was a success : I disagree [ that it ’ s a success to lose the “ commodity ” television industry ] . Not only did we lose an untold number of jobs , we broke the chain of experience that is so important in technological evolution . As happened with batteries , abandoning today ’ s “ commodity ” manufacturing can lock you out of tomorrow ’ s emerging industry . [ 133 ] In other words , innovation without an advanced industrial commons becomes much harder , and the ability to scale any innovations that occur , even harder . Figure 4 : Components of an industrial commons [ 134 ] As noted , foreign policy thinking is largely devoid of sophisticated analysis of industries , much less power industries . Conventional economics is only a bit better , but generally assumes that barriers to entry—difficulties for entrepreneurs or existing businesses to enter a competitor ’ s line of business—are generally small , and to the extent they are not , are a result of patents , government regulations , or unfair competition , the latter of which antitrust authorities must be ever vigilant against . Indeed , their ideal world is one of perfect competition , wherein entry barriers are zero . Prominent Austrian school ( free market ) economist Ludwig Von Mises spoke for many economists when he wrote , “ The freedom to enter any business is essential to the preservation of the free enterprise. ” [ 135 ] Milton Friedman agreed : “ The greatest enemy of freedom has been concentrated power. ” [ 136 ] And the neo-Brandeisians have the same view but for different reasons . Where the free-market conservatives envision an economy with no entry barriers because it enables freedom and maximizes “ market forces , ” the neo-Brandeisians want it because they hate capitalist profits . This is wrong even without considering China . As Joseph Schumpeter rightly argued , the barriers to entry that innovative firms often create are always temporary . This is why Schumpeter wrote , “ Profit … is the premium put upon successful innovation in capitalist society and is temporary by nature : it will vanish in the subsequent process of competition and adaptation. ” [ 137 ] In other words , if the best an entrepreneur could hope for was making back the cost of capital , there would be little innovation . After competitive failure of U.S. firms from Chinese aggression , the idea that the United States can easily get back in the market is fanciful . The reality is that there are many interconnected factors that can create significant barriers for companies attempting to enter advanced industries . But it is even more wrong when considering Chinese competition because it uses the massive power of the CCP to break down U.S. barriers of competition to not enable market forces to work , but rather to vanquish their business foes . For the purposes of the discussion here , that means that after competitive failure of U.S. firms from Chinese aggression , the idea that the United States can easily get back in the market is fanciful . In other words , if more American companies in power industries fail or are seriously weakened to the point where they are much smaller , it is likely that those losses will be permanent . Even if the USG woke up and on a bipartisan basis realized that the United States must rebuild that lost capacity , it would be extremely difficult and enormously expensive . That is why , as discussed ahead , it is so critical to slow the relative loss of power industries to China . Table 1 , from a 1990 survey of U.S. firms , identifies multiple barriers to entry , with absolute cost advantages being the most important . Capital requirements are ranked second . In other words , some industries require large amounts of capital investment to enter . While economists may dismiss barriers to entry , firms take them deadly seriously because they are the core thing business leaders rightly work for . Table 1 : Barriers to market entry ranked by U.S. firms in 1990 [ 138 ] Barriers Mean Std . Dev .

The most formidable obstacle is often the accelerated pace of technological advancement that occurs during a company ’ s absence . In advanced industries , knowledge compounds rapidly , and the technological gap can become insurmountable . Companies lose access to cutting-edge research , miss critical patent opportunities , and lose design capabilities—and their technical workforce disperses to competitors or just atrophies . The tacit knowledge embedded in organizational routines , process technology and layout , and employee expertise is particularly difficult to reconstruct . Reentry typically demands massive up-front investments in R & D , manufacturing capabilities , and infrastructure . Advanced industries often require specialized equipment , clean rooms , or complex supply chains that represent sunk costs with limited alternative uses . Financial markets may view reentry attempts skeptically , making capital more expensive or difficult to obtain . This is especially true in the United States where most markets want quick and certain returns . The company must also compete against established players with proven track records . During a company ’ s absence , market concentration may have increased , with remaining competitors strengthening their positions through consolidation , economies of scale , or network effects . This is particularly the case after Chinese firm market expansion . Established players often have preferential access to key suppliers , distribution channels , and talent pools . Moreover , customer relationships in B2B advanced industries are typically long term and trust based , making market penetration extremely challenging for returning entrants . In most cases , there are customer switching costs . Often the only way of entry is massive cost reductions or , if possible , a significant increase in the value proposition . Brand is another barrier to entry . If the competitor ’ s brand is strong , it ’ s hard to get into a market . To date , Chinese firms are generally not strong in brand , but that is changing . Advanced industries frequently involve complex regulatory environments that evolve continuously . Companies lose institutional knowledge about compliance requirements , relationships with regulatory bodies , and understanding of approval processes . New regulations may have emerged that create additional barriers , and the cost of achieving compliance from scratch can be prohibitive . This is especially the case when American companies try to reenter overseas markets . Specialized talent in advanced industries is often scarce and highly mobile . During the exit period , key personnel typically join competitors or leave the industry entirely . As we have seen with China , sometimes American talent actually goes and works for Chinese firms . If there are few firms in the United States with the demand for this specialized talent , the worker ’ s skills atrophy and are not used . Rebuilding teams requires not only recruiting individual experts but also reconstructing the collaborative knowledge networks and organizational capabilities that enable innovation and execution . Advanced industries often rely on complex ecosystems of specialized suppliers , research institutions , complementary service providers , and training institutions . These relationships take years to develop and may have become exclusive or capacity-constrained during the company ’ s absence . Reentry may require simultaneously rebuilding multiple interdependent relationships across the value chain . A factor that is given little attention , yet is important , is the barriers to entry when enough national power industries have lost market share or gone out of business , and therefore the pressure on government to adopt national power industry support policies . We can see that in a country such as Canada , which has deindustrialized so much and has so few advanced technology firms that the voices of high-end , knowledge-based firms that need strong government advanced industry policies are at best a whisper . Instead , companies that want cheap immigrant labor , banks and other financial services firms , and natural resource companies that want more rights to extract minerals and other materials dominate Canadian politics . To the extent advanced technology firms exist , they are dominated by small Canadian-owned firms that want handouts rather than a leg up . So , to the extent the Canadian government would put in place advanced industry techno-economic strategy , it would have to have capabilities for independent action that it does not now possess . The lobbying forces of other firms are just too strong . The United States is fortunate because it still has enough of a critical mass of large technology firms that press the USG to not put in place ill-advised anti-national power industry policies and to put in place favorable ones . But each weakening or death of an American national power industry firm with a Washington government-relations budget serves as one more barrier to reentry for the nation as whole . The United States is fortunate because it still has enough of a critical mass of large technology firms that press the USG to not put in place ill-advised anti-national power industry policies and to put in place favorable ones . Industries evolve through cycles of technological paradigms , and companies that exit during one paradigm may find the next cycle dominated by different technologies or business models . The timing of reentry attempts relative to industry cycles , product life cycles , and competitive dynamics can determine success or failure . The interaction between these factors creates what economists call “ path dependency , ” wherein a company ’ s current competitive position is heavily influenced by its historical choices and market evolution during its absence . This explains why even well-resourced companies with strong track records in other industries often struggle to successfully reenter advanced sectors in which they previously competed . Consumer welfare economics assumes that factor price adjustments lead to equilibrium . If a company loses market share , it cuts prices and regain it . But the reality , especially in capital- and research-intensive industries , is that market share loss can trigger a downward cumulative causation cycle . As figure 5 shows , less revenue can lead to less reinvestment in R & D which means that next-generation products either are not as goods as the competitors ’ or enter the market late , in both cases reducing market share and sales even more . With fewer sales , capital investment budgets are cut , meaning that the company has a harder time investing in the most modern equipment , leading to slower productivity growth and reduced cost competitiveness , with other firms taking even more market share . And both factors lead to less innovation and less market share , with the downward cycle continuing to repeat unless the competitor firm makes a serious error or the core firm is able to discover a breakthrough innovation that lets it back in the game . Figure 5 : The downward process Unlike most U.S. policymakers who either ignore barriers to entry or do everything possible to lower them to boost competition , even if it means that Chinese firms enter the U.S. market , most Chinese policymakers deeply understand techno-economic and trade factors and dynamics , including barriers to entry and how to overcome foreign barriers and then maintain their own . And that is why they work so hard to erect them , including promoting mergers , limiting foreign company access to Chinese markets , and providing subsidies so Chinese companies can attack foreign company margins with deep discounts below cost . At one level , it appears difficult for companies attempting to attack or disrupt established players in advanced industries . After all , these companies should have many of the barriers to entry previously described . But there are ways firms can successfully attack . And , as discussed , the CCP provides support for these attacks . Attacking companies should focus on periods when incumbents are most vulnerable , including during technological transitions , regulatory changes , and market disruptions . For example , when many U.S. companies were retrenching in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis , and again during the 2020 COVID crisis , Chinese companies , backed by the CCP , kept up , and even accelerated their rate of investment . When markets came back to “ normal , ” they had gained market share at the expense of more prudent and market-driven Western companies . In the transition to 5G wireless , state-backed Huawei pushed hard to get into markets in developing nations , precluding Western companies from getting in , and thus setting themselves up for next generation sales . In the United States , companies such as Tesla succeeded by timing their entry during the EV transition when traditional automakers were slow to adapt . The CCP understood where the global market was going and not only subsidized its EV providers but also spurred EV demand through government policies ( reduced taxes on EVs , better access to roads , etc . ) This enabled the Chinese EV makers to sell massive numbers of vehicles in China and , as a result , gain scale economies and learning by doing . Western vehicle makers are rightly focused on current limited consumer demand for EVs , but now have been seriously disadvantaged in their efforts to move into the new EV markets . Only the Biden EV tariffs have prevented significant damage . China has done this in a range of other industries , including solar panels and drones , and is seeking a similar victory in industries such as robots , including humanoid robots . Most Chinese policymakers deeply understand techno-economic and trade factors and dynamics , including barriers to entry and how to overcome foreign barriers and then maintain their own . MIT business scholar Clay Christenssen argued that attackers seldom attack at the top , most profitable segments . Rather , they usually attack from the bottom on segments that are less profitable , less innovation based , and more likely to be given up by incumbents . Rather than launch frontal attacks on incumbents ’ core markets , which incumbents are more likely to fight to defend , successful attackers often focus on neglected segments , emerging applications , or underserved customer needs . This allows them to establish footholds without triggering immediate competitive responses , while building capabilities and market presence . They then use these gains , coupled with the erosion of sales and profits from the incumbents to steadily move up in their attacks . China has done this in many markets , focusing on more commodity-like products ( e.g. , bulk chemicals , legacy chips , lower-end mobile phones , LCD displays , etc. ) . This combination of “ good enough ” products at a much more competitive price point is often a winning combination , especially in the non-OECD world where price is a more important factor . That not only weakens the rich country incumbents who sell in those markets , but also gives the Chinese firms revenues to move up the value chain . Huawei ’ s rise to global dominance in telecom equipment is a case study in that strategy . Companies competing against other companies in normal countries have more ability to attack than Western companies do against Chinese attackers . Most importantly is IP . Often , an attacker will use IP from the defender without their permission , and the attacker can win in court , thus significantly blunting the attack ; and if they receive damages , weakening the attacker . But that is much more difficult against a Chinese attacker , at least in the Chinese market , because Chinese courts are an instrument of Chinese national power industry strategy and seldom side with the non-Chinese company . And even in the home U.S. market , that can be difficult , as winning a court case or obtaining a Section 337 exclusion order from the U.S. International Trade Commission against an unfair competing Chinese firm can be costly and difficult , especially as the law requires a showing of immediate market share loss . Defenders often can successfully defend against attacks through exclusive supplier agreements or strategic partnerships . But these are not possible in China . In fact , the CCP will weaponize them against foreign companies to limit their access to Chinese suppliers in order to favor their CCP champion attacker . The most important weapons CCP-backed attackers have are a protected market ( in China and Belt and Road nations ) and massive subsidies . Take CCP company COMAC , which is competing with Boeing and Airbus in the commercial aircraft market . There is a reason why , before COMAC , there were only two companies . The entry barriers were extremely high given the knowledge and capital requirements . But despite being a duopoly , the competition between Boeing and Airbus was intense , with each fighting intensively for big orders with airlines around the world . This was a market that , absent state intervention or some completely disruptive innovation ( e.g. , a hypersonic space plane ) , was going to stay a duopoly for the foreseeable future . No sane commercial company would seek to enter the market , because it would mean losing billions of dollars for at least a decade or more . But that did not stop China . China vaulted over those barriers by providing massive subsidies , enticing and threatening foreign parts and systems providers to sell COMAC what it needed , and then reserving the Chinese market for COMAC and subsidizing entry in Belt and Road countries . That is how a Chinese company overcomes big barriers to entry . If the United States and the West are to avoid losing the national power industry war , they will need to adopt the correct overall strategy . That will likely prove daunting , at least for now , because the vast majority of expert voices on foreign and economics relations with China support the wrong strategies . China overcomes barriers to market entry by subsidizing state-backed industrial champions such as COMAC If this dynamic plays out as it has in some other industries , the result will be a cumulative causation decline of Boeing and Airbus . They are likely to lose massive sales revenue in China and many of the less developed nations that China seeks to sell to with extremely generous export financing . And that means they will have less money to invest in next-generation aircraft . That in turn will reduce future sales , and the cycle will continue until perhaps only one of the two companies is left . We could see the same dynamic playing out in EVs , and even advanced industries such as memory chips and biopharmaceuticals . Given that China is not a normal competitor , the only away of defending against this kind of attack is with a trade wall in OECD nations against these attacks . Ideally , as we will discuss next year in a report on policy recommendations , this would mean long-term exclusion orders against the sales in OECD nations of unfairly competing Chinese companies . But import bans are only one tool . If the United States and the West overall are to avoid losing the national power industry war , they will need to adopt the correct overall strategy . That will likely prove daunting , at least for now , because the vast majority of expert voices on foreign and economic relations with China support the wrong strategies . America needs a coherent strategy to shape , guide , and implement policy choices . Victory in a kinetic war often goes to the side with the best overall strategy . Strategic choices need to be made . When and where to attack ? When to retreat ? When to outflank versus when to conduct a frontal assault ? How to best combine and coordinate forces ? And even when to leave the battlefield and form a redoubt ? The techno-economic and trade war with China is no different . First and foremost , it requires an acknowledgment of the reality of the war and hence the need for a strategy . Some simply refuse to see that America ( and its allies ) are being attacked , denying the existence of national power industries , ignoring the CCP ’ s stated intentions and long litany of aggression , and turning a blind eye to U.S. power industry injury and even death . Others say “ war ” is an incendiary and provocative term and that the United States and China are only in competition or , at worst , perhaps in a narrow “ trade war ” over a few industries . Many even assert that we are allies in addressing global challenges . Some even say that it doesn ’ t matter . After all , countries don ’ t compete . Or China is just trying to catch up . Or we benefit from trading with China . Or we need to engage with China . Etc . But we are in a techno-economic and trade war , and it does matter . Indeed , there is a potential tidal wave of value destruction headed at U.S. national power industries , as better funded and more financially patient Chinese competitors keep up their relentless global expansion . PRC champions are coming after Western firms in national power industries , and they will not stop . Indeed , the PRC ’ s is a scorched earth campaign , leaving no survivors , always maintaining the assault . And firms in U.S. and allied national power industries ( including Europe ) have nowhere to hide from this techno-economic blitzkrieg unless governments take action based on a coherent strategy . Overall , the issue of China is largely framed by international relations scholars and experts , not business and industrial strategy experts . The former are aware of such competition , but they largely see it as subservient to overall foreign policy considerations and goals . Moreover , few understand the operation of advanced industries , the nature of the competition and the importance of barriers to entry and reentry . As such , the prevailing narratives largely ignore the strategic threats that techno-economic and trade wars pose for U.S. power . When it comes to China , U.S. experts and pundits advance a number of strategic choices . Some put good relations with China above all other considerations . Some are based on a denial of the conflict . Others accept the conflict , but don ’ t see the need for a new strategy . Others are guided by Ricardian free trade theory with its overarching belief in trade as always being win-win . Many , including trade and foreign policy experts , are globalists in the sense that the world should be one with few or no trade barriers and open and sustained cooperation between nations—and if the allies continue to work with China , that world will emerge . There is a potential tidal wave of value destruction headed at U.S. national power industries , as better funded and more financially patient Chinese competitors keep up their relentless global expansion . Others hold an explicit or implicit derision of the United States , seeing it as a white , imperial nation , motivated by capitalist greed . Therefore , the United States should be dethroned as the global hegemon . And many who specialize in studying China get “ captured ” by China , seeing the world , at least partially , through its eyes . And due to the fact that the CCP rewards and punishes U.S. Chinese studies scholars based on whether it likes their views , many U.S. scholars trim their sails . Yet , collectively , these experts articulate a range of views and opinions that influence preferred strategic choice . As such , these choices need to be analyzed and assessed . For the sake of clarity , I provide analogies and titles reflective of strategic choices made in past wars , including WWII and in the conflict with the Soviet Union and how current strategic choices mirror those . Many of these proposed strategic approaches are offered by engagers , those policy experts and scholars who put engagement with China above all else . For them , nothing should get in the way of engagement . As such , they exaggerate and stress the supposed panoply of benefits from being solicitous to the CCP , and dismiss and downplay the actions the CCP takes that are against U.S. interests . The problem is that the days of engagement are , if they were ever legitimate to begin with , gone . Yet , engagers persist in out-of-date , flawed strategic framing . China scholar David Schambaugh has said about the engagers that “ these were individuals who had spent their entire professional careers working to engage China . Now their life ’ s work was under attack , and many individuals were naturally defensive. ” [ 139 ] There are several flavors of engagement . There is no question that the United State gave too much aid to the Soviet Union during WWII , enabling them to gain more ground in the West and emerge stronger after the war with Germany to become a global adversary with America . FDR was oblivious to the threat from Stalin and even saw “ Uncle Joe ” as someone he could work it . Today , one China strategy is to simply assume that there is no conflict , and that the opposite is even true : a strong China is good for the world . One article lists the cases for de-escalation and engagement : China accounts for global GDP growth . China drives global economic growth , so a sound bilateral relationship is important to American consumers and workers , as well as to families who are counting on stock market returns to pay for their retirement . In the 10 years through 2019 , China , on average , accounted for about one third of global economic growth , larger than thecombinedshare . [ 140 ] Likewise , the U.S. China Business Council ) has written , “ Today , the US-China trade relationship actually supports roughly 2.6 million jobs in the United States across a range of industries . ” [ 141 ] Parroting the standard fare , an article in Foreign Affairs entitled “ The Overreach of the China Hawks : Aggression Is the Wrong Response to Beijing ” argues , “ Closer ties with Beijing have led to Chinese acceptance of international rules in areas such as nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction , arms control , and some aspects of global trade and finance . Engagement also brought China into the global economy and fueled economic growth worldwide. ” [ 142 ] These comments about China fueling growth demonstrates the engagers ’ ignorance of both domestic and international economics . They assume China boosted global growth because China imported some goods . But China consistently ran a trade surplus . The net effect on GDP in the rest of the world was negative , not positive , as GDP is lowered when X-M ( exports minus imports ) is negative . So yes , exports to China supports jobs in the United States , but imports to the United States from China take away jobs from the United States , and since the United States runs a massive trade deficit with China , the U.S. production economy has been weakened , even though consumers save a few bucks . Moreover , this framing reflects stale Keynesian demand-side thinking , suggesting that demand from China , rather than lower interest rates from the Fed , keeps the U.S. economy at full employment . U.S. full employment is not dependent in any way shape or form on what China does . Domestic demand should always equal domestic supply , and when it doesn ’ t , domestic monetary and fiscal policy help restore the balance . The reality is rather than the CCP helping global growth , it weakened it . The CCP ’ s price suppression of wages and other business costs at home led to reduced productivity worldwide , as rather than invest in automation at home , companies in high-wage economies moved production to low-wage , less automated China , lowering global growth . And as China unfairly dominated manufacturing , the opportunities to move up the value chain for developing economies shrank to nothing . And finally , as ITIF has shown , China ’ s unfair “ innovation mercantilist strategies have lowered global innovation as less innovative Chinese firms unfairly took market share from more innovative Western firms . [ 143 ] The reality is that U. S. growth does not depend on Chinese growth or any other foreign economy growth ; in the moderate term , it depends on U.S. domestic productivity growth and nothing else . Related to this is the foreign policy and international economy consensus that praises China for raising tens of millions out of poverty . An article by leading China experts in Foreign Affairs entitled “ T he Overreach of the China Hawks : Aggression Is the Wrong Response to Beijing ” argues , “ It is true , as [ Aaron ] Friedberg asserts , that China ’ s leaders seek to harness economic growth to boost the nation ’ s international stature and power . But Friedberg insists that this goal overrides all other purposes , ignoring the very real ways in which growth has benefited huge numbers of Chinese citizens. ” [ 144 ] This is truly a striking statement , echoing fellow traveler statements in the 1930s and 1940s , arguing that sure , while Stalin had show trials , purges , and gulags , at least he boosted growth . Since when does the welfare of an adversary ’ s citizens become of paramount concern for U.S. foreign policy ? [ 145 ] What is even more striking is that if there is one thing China ’ s techno-economic strategy has not done is benefit huge numbers of Chinese citizens . The CCP ’ s entire strategy has been to immiserate the proletariat to invest in weapons—a massive military and massively subsidized national power industries . If you want to look at a Chinese territory that benefited its citizens over the same period of time , look at Taiwan . After the revolutionary overthrow of the legitimate Kuomintang government by the CCP in 1949 , China and Taiwan had about the same GDP per capita . Today , Taiwan ’ s is almost three times greater . [ 146 ] One way to avoid having to deal with adversaries is to define them as allies , either by formal agreements , informal collaboration , or simply assuming a lack of adversariness . Stalin was so desperate to avoid war with Hitler that he blindly signed the Molotov/Ribbentrop Pact , hoping that Hitler would turn west instead of east and the capitalist powers would exhaust themselves , allowing Stalin to move in and conquer Western territory . But if Stalin had only read Mein Kampf , he would have realized that Hitler ’ s overarching goal was not to fight the West but to stamp out communism . Today , many U.S. foreign policy experts believe that the United States and China are allies in ensuring a safe and secure world . Indeed , this has been the default view of the U.S. foreign policy establishment for decades . A 1994 report by the Trilateral Commission argued that “ China should be regarded more as an opportunity than a threat ” and that the United States should seek to “ incorporate China in the emerging world order. ” [ 147 ] This view has changed little over time , as we see in a 2019 in an open letter in The Washington Post complaining about Trump ’ s more assertive policy toward China . Among seven key points made by over 100 prominent U.S. foreign policy scholars , including friends of China Stapleton Roy and Susan Thorton , was , “ We do not believe Beijing is an economic enemy or an existential national security threat that must be confronted in every sphere. ” [ 148 ] It goes on to state , “ The fear that Beijing will replace the United States as the global leader is exaggerated. ” I wonder if six years later any of the 100 signers would like to take back this last statement . Along a similar vein , leading China scholars Jude Blanchette and Ryan Hass have written : Instead of these two great nations pooling their considerable economic resources and human talent to jointly address the world ’ s many growing challenges , they lock horns in a multifaceted strategic competition . The blunt reality is that because of these deep divisions , there will be diseases that will not be cured , there will be children who will unnecessarily suffer , and our climate will continue to degrade as opportunities for global cooperation slip through humanity ’ s fingers . The mutual mistrust and strategic rivalry between the United States and China create barriers to innovation , collaboration , and the bold , unified action needed to tackle existential threats . In this fractured global landscape , the pursuit of dominance and security overshadows the shared responsibility to steward a livable future for all , leaving the world worse off . [ 149 ] They continued : Collaboration with China is essential to addressing climate change . And even amid trade wars and derisking , China remains an important economic and trading partner with the United States . Scientists of the two countries have collaborated with each other on important and meaningful basic research projects that benefit not only the two countries but all of humankind . One area of fruitful research is in agriculture… The common view is that the United States and China need to cooperate to address climate change , global terrorism , infectious diseases , and other global challenges . [ 150 ] Today , many U.S. foreign policy experts believe that the United States and China are allies in ensuring a safe and secure world . Those who assert that the United States and China are adversaries or even in competition with China are routinely excoriated by the cooperation camp . We see this in a vitriolic attack on a leading scholar in the China competition camp , Princeton University scholar Aaron Freidberg . A group of engagers wrote in Foreign Affairs —the journal of the engagers—that “ Friedberg calls not for mere competition but for an antagonistic rivalry that minimizes any attempt at cooperation. ” [ 151 ] They even wrote , “ A pragmatic policy would recognize the value of economic ties with China and encourage continued Sino-U.S. cooperation in many critical areas , including technology. ” [ 152 ] How exactly do they explain how Chinese technology and trade policy has helped the United States on net ? They simply waive their hands and assert it . In other words , for this still powerful camp , cooperation is the paramount goal , and responding to Chinese aggression gets in the way by irritating our interlocutors . They are certainly right about the last part : yes , if the USG presses China on issues of true national concern and even survival , cooperation will be much harder . But if the USG does not , U.S. global leadership will be threatened . There are at least two major problems with the engagement camp . First , they are so focused on engagement for engagement ’ s sake that they come up with a seemingly endless litany of things we must engage on . Anything to keep engagement going . But presumably these issues are important to both the United States and China . In this case , why is the CCP not the supplicant to the USG , coming to Washington to ask the United States if it will cooperate with China and giving the United States concessions for doing so . Because only U.S. experts and pundits are this naïve . There is little evidence that the CCP sees things this way . It is happy to talk about win-win relations , but we should not take them at their word . The CCP uses the desire for cooperation to advance its own specific techno-economic predatory practices . CCP officials are happy to say they will cooperate on climate change as long as the United States does not press China on an issues such as IP theft . And in the past , the United States has naïvely taken that deal , believing it has gotten the best of it . Second , reflecting Stalin ’ s naïveté and desperation with Hitler , many U.S. officials and pundits assume that China will help America shoulder the heavy responsibility for global order , including open and fair trade . Nothing is further from the truth . The CCP does not want co-responsibility for global order ; it wants sole responsibility so it can impose its version of global order . And when it comes to trade , China ’ s vision harkens back to British trade policy in the 1700s and 1800s , wherein Britain exported manufacturing goods to its empire and imported underpriced commodities . Given China ’ s history and current practice of massive mercantilism , the idea that anyone could actually respond to these claims with a straight face is truly astounding . Most importantly , engagement always comes at a price . The CCP and its leadership are realists , caring only about the CCP ’ s Marxist-Leninist interests . When CCP officials see the USG asking it for help for addressing a global problem , they always exact a price . If this litany of cooperation is of no real interest to China , then why are we pushing for them , when most of the issues are either related to global concerns ( and why are these our concerns if addressing them comes at a cost to America ? ) or can be dealt with by the United States alone ? A core reason , of course , is because so much of the U.S. foreign policy community puts governing the world ahead of advancing U.S. interests , especially techno-economic capabilities and strengths , something the engagers show absolutely no interest in . Most importantly , engagement always comes at a price . The CCP and its leadership are realists , caring only about the CCP ’ s Marxist-Leninist interests . When CCP officials see the USG asking it for help for addressing a global problem , they always exact a price . Sure , we will help you , but only if you have to back off key issues , especially our predatory trade , tech , and economic actions that are hurting your national power industry firms . It would be one thing if the factors the USG were being supplicants for truly mattered and could be addressed by “ cooperation. ” But the issues either don ’ t or can ’ t . Just look at the list of issues the USG constantly trots out as important to cooperate on . After the San Francisco summit of 2023 with Biden and Xi , the USG statement said that : the deliverables included more cooperation on artificial intelligence , a working group to promote tourism , cooperation in counter-narcotics , and combatting fentanyl trafficking , enhanced cooperation on climate change , an increase in airline flights , and people to people exchanges . [ 153 ] Later , National Security Council head Jake Sullivan said , “ We are ready to coordinate on climate , health security , macroeconomic stability , and … risks posed by AI. ” [ 154 ] Given that the Chinese can not be negotiated with on issues of real concern , especially techno-economic and trade ones , rather than walk away and say that nothing was accomplished , the administration put on a happy face with these “ important ” issues of cooperation . No one ever asks , “ Why do we need to cooperate on these ? ” They are seen as self-obvious . But they should be questioned , as they are either not needed , not important , or something countries can do on their own . Let ’ s look at each one : ▪ Artificial Intelligence . What for ? The United States does not need to worry about any AI use in our country because Congress could enact a regulatory regime to govern AI if needed . We don ’ t worry about unsafe drugs from other nations because we have Federal Drug Administration drug approvals . AI is no different . Ahh , but what about the killer Terminator AI ? What about it ? It is science fiction , not reality . Even if it were reality , it ’ s in the CCP ’ s interest not to get terminated by AI too . We don ’ t need to cooperate . What about AI weapons ? Does anyone really believe that America should limit its battlefield use on the basis of an agreement signed with the CCP ? If you do , I have a bridge to sell you . ▪ Tourism promotion . Surely , they must be kidding . Who cares ? And why would the United States want more Chinese tourists , and why do we need to cooperate with the CCP on it in anyway ? ▪ Airline flights . Again , what ? If we want more airline flights from China , the Federal Aviation Administration and U.S. airports can make that happen . And if the CCP wants more U.S. flights , it can do the same . ▪ People-to-people exchanges . See above re : airline flights . ▪ Cooperation in counter-narcotics . Is this not something the CCP is very interested in ? If so , they can ask us for help . ▪ Combatting fentanyl trafficking . Okay , this is another one of “ you must be kidding. ” The CCP could stop the flow of fentanyl and precursors to the United States next week , but it chooses not to because they know it weakens America and strengthens China . ▪ Health security . Let me get this right . It is likely that a CCP lab created ( with financial help from America ’ s National Institutes of Health ) and inadvertently let loose the COVID-19 virus on the world and then proceeded to cover it up and manipulated the World Health Organization to do its bidding . We should cooperate with a government that did that ? [ 155 ] This is something out of Orwell . ▪ Macroeconomic stability . With China having a long-running a massive trade surplus with the world while intentionally trying to deindustrialize the world , we should ask their help with macroeconomic stability ? Wow . And again , presumably China has an interest in macroeconomic stability in the face of a global financial collapse or massive recession . So why are we the ones asking for it ? ▪ And of course , wait for it… climate change . The big kahuna . But isn ’ t China concerned about climate change too ? It is more vulnerable to climate change than the United States is given the larger share of its population at sea level and its lower per capita income . Why does the CCP not beg the United States to do more ? Why should we implore them ? And the reality is that climate change will never be solved until we get clean energy technology that costs the same or less as dirty . No amount of “ cooperation ” will help . The reality is that the CCP will keep increasing its emissions of greenhouse gases until it makes economic sense for it to stop . To be sure , it is important not to unilaterally cut off diplomatic ties with China . But the idea that we need China to help us on certain matters and that this means not pressing them harder for their techno-economic aggression against U.S. ( and allied ) companies and the U.S. economy is just the ultimate in naïveté . The reality is that we are long past the time when the USG could influence China policy in any meaningful way . The first Obama administration was the last time that was possible . Their power is just too great now . Let ’ s top being a supplicant and get on with defending our economy from Chinese techno-economic aggression . A good example of this view is from the Peterson Institute for International Relations . Ha Jiming ( a scholar in China ) and Adam Posen wrote : We all believe that China-U.S. trade has been clearly win-win , and will continue to be so if it is conducted by the rules of that order , and if those rules are consensually adapted to economic change . In fact , given the degree to which China has developed , the two economies have more fundamental economic interests in common now than before , including in safeguarding and abiding by that system . [ 156 ] They view the competition as normal and healthy , writing , “ Chinese companies have a right to compete with U.S. companies and succeed in any sector , including in high-tech. ” [ 157 ] They went on to state : While much has been made of Made in China 2025 and the earlier “ indigenous innovation ” programs , the Chinese government ’ s aspirations to make China a technological leader in some fields should not be considered a threat to the United States . Even some government subsidization of relevant R & D or technical education in this pursuit should not be inherently contentious . [ 158 ] In other words , in this view , global trade is always win-win , value maximizing , and pointing out that China is not a Ricardian trader but a power trader intent on dominance is simply “ not cricket. ” Peterson ’ s commitment to global integration and free trade is so blinding and all-encompassing that it simply can not admit that China is not playing by global welfare-maximizing rules . No worry , it will all work out ; the natural global division of labor will prevail . Likewise , Ryan Hass at the Brookings Institution wants the United States not to be overly harsh with China , including on techno-economic issues , so that we can work cooperatively on global challenges such as global warming . [ 159 ] As part of his naïveté toward communist regimes , including the CCP , George Marshall proposed the “ Marshall Plan : to extend aid to the Soviets in part to bring them closer to the United States. ” [ 160 ] Stalin clearly had no interest in taking our money or becoming closer . Likewise , the United States has long supported aid to China to keep them engaged . As Shambaugh wrote , the Carter administration saw that “ science and tech was the perfect medium to keep the Chinese engaged given Beijing ’ s own prioritization on modernization. ” [ 161 ] Carter ’ s agreement stated , “ Affirming that such cooperation can strengthen friendly relations between both countries. ” [ 162 ] In 2006 , the State Department wrote of the agreement , “ The S & T Agreement has withstood the test of political turmoil and has provided a stabilizing influence on U.S.— Sino relations. ” [ 163 ] According to the Congressional Research Service , U.S. AID and the State Department provided over $ 417 million in aid to China between 2001 and 2017 . [ 164 ] The U.S.-supported World Bank still provides funding to China . [ 165 ] Even the Department of War provides funding to Chinese research universities . [ 166 ] In other words , helping Ch ina grow its national power industries by sharing U.S. science and technology is good because it keeps the CCP favorable toward America . Clearly , this did not stop China from engaging in massive IP theft and forced technology transfer against U.S. companies . The foreign policy Left loves to advance the narrative that it was Harry Truman ’ s hawkishness , not FDR ’ s coddling of “ Uncle Joe ” Stalin , that caused the Cold War . Stalin just wanted to be left alone . Of course , this framing is ideological nonsense . Stalin was always the aggressor , and all Truman did was help America wake up to it . Today , this narrative is applied to the United States and China . If only the United States , and in particular China hawks , would just stop pressing China , CCP leaders would become more reasonable . As early as 1998 , a review of Peter Rodman ’ s book Between Friendship and Rivalry : China and America in the 21st Century ( Rodman was deputy national security advisor in the Reagan administration ) stated that there is a “ drift toward strategic rivalry between China and the United States , but that it can be slowed or reversed if the two sides find common ground on such strategic issues as Korea , Pakistan , regional stability , and the Asian economic crisis. ” [ 167 ] In other words , if we don ’ t cooperate with China , they will try to become our rival . [ 168 ] Foreign policy professor Charles Glaser agrees , writing that “ China ’ s Rise Can Be Peaceful If the U.S. Doesn ’ t Provoke It. ” [ 169 ] As David Shambaugh wrote , this camp argues that “ it was not China ’ s fault or actions that had caused the relationship to deteriorate so precipitously , it was America ’ s fault ! ” [ 170 ] Some go even harder on this blame game . A report for the Quincy Institute , an organization that emphasizes military restraint and diplomatic engagement and cooperation , states : An alternative China policy would foreground internationalism , global cooperation , and multilateral efforts against climate change , public health dangers , and global inequality . Such an approach would not only reduce bilateral tensions , it would also confront the root causes of great power conflict and the rise of illiberal politics in China , the United States , and around the world . [ 171 ] If we just got rid of capitalism , the CCP would like us more . I am sure it would . When Labour , Liberal , and Conservative parties in Britain in the 1930s started to wake up to the threat from German National Socialism , certain segments of British society were sympathetic to Hitler , especially Oswald Mosley ’ s “ black shirt ” movement . Today , while not as explicit or perhaps extreme , there are some whose strategy is that the United States should do everything possible to get close to China , downplaying its Marxist-Leninist nature and seeking friendship . The leading organization with this view is the National Committee on U.S. China Relations ( NCUSR ) . It has written , worryingly , that “ more than three-quarters of Americans hold an unfavorable view of China. ” [ 172 ] Rather than accept that Americans may be onto something ( e.g. , Uyghur oppression , lack of Chinese citizen freedom , closed U.S. factories , aggression toward Taiwan , etc . ) NCUSR ’ s “ Public Intellectuals Program is trying to change that. ” [ 173 ] In other words , it would like to see these three-quarters of Americans hold a favorable view of China . And as such , its strategy is to do everything to keep relations strong . NCUSR tells us that China has a massive military not because of external aggression , but because it needs to control tensions at home . [ 174 ] It tells us that China is not the only one that sees U.S. global leadership as problematic , and China needs to have much greater say in shaping global affairs . [ 175 ] The progressive Left , with its global-proletariat and anti-U.S. views , also embraces this perspective . For many of them , having China replace the United States as the global hegemon would be a welcome relief . Another is “ The Committee of 100 , ” a group of Chinese Americans chaired by former ambassador to China Gary Locke . The group objects to policies limiting China . For example , it opposes legislation limiting Chinese nationals ’ ability to buy U.S. farmland . [ 176 ] It argues that investigations and prosecutions of Chinese spies and IP thieves were racial profiling , even though it is clear that the CCP is massively supportive of IP theft in the United States , and there were no investigations of other Asian nationalities . [ 177 ] The progressive Left , with its global-proletariat and anti-U.S. views , also embraces this perspective . For many of them , having China replace the United States as the global hegemon would be a welcome relief . Even CCP fellow travelers such as Columbia ’ s Jeffrey Sachs are in this camp . [ 178 ] Sachs , a “ useful idiot ” to the CCP , publishes articles in the state-run journal China Daily about U.S. decline and the problems with U.S. hegemony and how China needs to become a global leader . [ 179 ] Sachs actually appears on Chinese TV news shows urging China and other countries to cooperate to resist the United States . [ 180 ] His message : Trump is a bad nationalist ; Xi is a wonderful globalist . [ 181 ] And he believes that China is the economic model for much of the rest of the world , especially developing nations , despite the fact that Chinese industrialization has meant the stagnation of industrial development in other developing nations . [ 182 ] He straight up argues that the U.S. should not be the leader of the world . And he has told the CCP ’ s Global Times that he “ regrets U.S. foreign policy toward China. ” [ 183 ] Jeff , perhaps you should instead teach in China ? Another flavor of this capitulation is that , in large part because of severe structural disfunctions in the United States , mostly due to Trump , China will overtake us as the global hegemon . But that ’ s okay because the world needs someone to lead . Better China than a post-hegemonic world of chaos . C. Fred Bergsten , former head of the Peterson Institute , exemplified this view in his 2022 book The United States vs. China : The Quest for Global Economic Leadership . [ 184 ] Bergsten is the dean emeritus of the U.S. foreign economic policy community , especially when it comes to global economic issues . And this book reflects that community ’ s bias . He wrote about China seeking global leadership , which he views as simply tough competition , not a zero-sum battle to win the war for national power industries . In fact , the book is largely sympathetic and optimistic toward China . In Bergsten ’ s conception , someone needs to lead the world order , and if it can ’ t be the United States , China should step up . He ( wrongly ) sees China as “ the largest engine of growth for the world economy , ” ( see above ) and ( wrongly ) says that Chinese cooperation with the U.S. is critical to solving key global challenges ( see above ) . [ 185 ] And rather than discuss China ’ s predatory policies , he wrote ( wrongly ) that “ China is now emphasizing domestic rather than international drivers of growth ” ( written just before China doubled its global trade surplus ) . In fact , the CCP has been trotting out the promise of rebalancing to domestic consumption for over 15 years and American policymakers still believe them—like Charlie Brown believes Lucy will really hold the football this time . And amazingly , he blames both China and the United States for the problems from COVID‑19 . He then wrote that once China catches up to the United States , it will become a responsible stakeholder and stop “ cheating. ” ( This is remarkably similar to what the advocates of China ’ s WTO accession said in the late 1990s ) . He touts China ’ s global economic leadership record , admitting that , sure , they have a few problems with mercantilism , but he is convinced that they will outgrow them once they catch up . But of course , that is like saying that once Stalin conquered most of the world , he would give up on his military aggression . By the time China becomes “ responsible , ” it will have won the war . If the CCP truly wants to help with global governance , it can start by dismantling its mercantilist techno-economic war machine and compete on the same basis other nations do . Bergsten then gets to the key point : the CCP ’ s main and overarching priority is to stay in power , not to dominate the world . And of course , he reminds us , don ’ t forget the power of the Western-oriented liberal reformers in the CCP . Thus , his conclusion is that the United States should assist China in elevating itself on the global stage and in more global institutions so that China can help us solve the world ’ s problems . The Carnegie Endowment agrees , writing in a volume on U.S.-China relations that “ the United States and China have a joint interest in finding a modus vivendi that provides the context for continued peace , prosperity , and national flourishing. ” [ 186 ] If the CCP truly wants to help with global governance , it can start by dismantling its mercantilist techno-economic war machine and compete on the same basis other nations do . Many of the preferred strategic choices come from those who are so convinced of America ’ s superiority and China ’ s structural flaws that there is nothing to worry about . These strategies council patience and no need for fundamental U.S. policy change . After President Truman and others sounded the alarm on the Soviets ’ global ambitions , few if any could ignore the Soviet Challenge . George Kenan , the architect of Soviet containment , argued that the Soviet Union would naturally self-destruct and counseled containment . And he was right about the outcome . But it took more than 40 years for that to happen , and the United States emerged victorious and dominant . Today , one thing both Xi and Trump have done is to make it harder to ignore that China is a pacing competitor to the United States . And so , some U.S. China scholars and pundits feel that they can not ignore that China challenge . But for those who finally now , albeit grudgingly , see China as a competitor , the preferred strategy is to Kennan-like wait for China to naturally decline . The idea is that just as with the Soviet Union , eventually , because of a raft of internal contradictions , the Chinese economy , and perhaps even the CCP , will self-destruct , and then China will no longer be a threat . Let ’ s just contain China and all will be well . The problem , as discussed ahead , is that even with the Soviet union ’ s rampant spying and IP theft from the West , it has never had the capability to structurally weaken America ’ s power industries . China does and will likely win well before it—if it even does—becomes a democracy . In 1998 , right before China ’ s growth accelerated even more , economist Nick Lardy wrote a book about China ’ s unfinished revolution and argued , “ Those who magnify the ‘ China threat ’ by extrapolating from China ’ s past growth rates are seriously mistaken. ” [ 187 ] Indeed , they were mistaken because , in contrast to Lardy ’ s pessimism , China grew even faster in the 2000s . But for neoclassical trade economists , there is no way a state-controlled economy can grow consistently . Not only that , but Lardy argued that continued growth depends on the CCP to surrender a great deal of economic and political power because , as we all know , state-directed capitalism is a failure . It is the strong desire to avoid facing the bracing reality that the United States has never in its history faced such a serious geopolitical threat that makes this kind of “ wait for Chinese decline ” so appealing . He then advocated that the United States needed to assist in China ’ s enterprise and bank restructuring program . Here he was right , because if China had followed Lardy ’ s neoclassical advice and its banks had focused on only making money rather than on fueling China ’ s national power industries , China would not be the techno-economic power it is today . More recently , John Mueller , a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute wrote , “ The lesson of the Cold War is not about the value of persistent containment in breaking your adversary ’ s will and sapping its power . It is about the wisdom of standing back , keeping your cool , and letting the contradictions in your opponent ’ s system become apparent. ” [ 188 ] In other words , for free-market ideologues , the Chinese economy must self-destruct because it violates the free-market creed . In addition , it is the strong desire to avoid facing the bracing reality that the United States has never in its history faced such a serious geopolitical threat that makes this kind of “ wait for Chinese decline ” so appealing . No need for the intellectually and emotionally difficult desire to reassess long held and deeply committed to ideas and doctrines . No need to question whether the current American techno-economic and trade system will suffice to respond effectively to the challenge . No need to retool one ’ s intellectual framework to adjust to new realities . This is why any and all bits of bad news out of China are leaped on by so many as evidence of China ’ s impending doom . China has too much internal competition . [ 189 ] Chinese firms have low profits . China has a housing bubble . China has a demographic challenge . [ 190 ] Chinese millionaires are fleeing . In 2021 , The New York Times published an opinion piece entitled “ How Will We Win the Second Cold War ? ” arguing that we will win by doing nothing and letting China self-destruct . [ 191 ] The article pointed to “ the inner weakness that the regime can ’ t get rid of because it ’ s part of its DNA. ” Ahh , that is comforting . We can continue our ways , and the problem will take care of itself . A Project Syndicate article agreed : “ No matter what China does , its economy ’ s momentum will be sapped by an aging , shrinking labor force , past overdrafts of public spending , and weak consumption . While the country is often now compared to Japan three decades ago , its outlook is actually much bleaker. ” [ 192 ] But to blindly assert that China will collapse because it has a broken economic model ( i.e. , not America ’ s ) is the height of hubris and wish fulfillment . As the author of the Atlantic Council report “ The Longer Telegram ” wrote , China is : more dexterous in survival than its Soviet counterpart , aided by the fact that China has studied carefully , over more than a decade , “ what went wrong ” in the Soviet Union . It would therefore be extremely hazardous for US strategists to accept that an effective future US China strategy should rest on an assumption that the Chinese system is destined to inevitably collapse from within . [ 193 ] A bit like die-hard Marxists in the 1980s and 1990s still holding onto the view that capitalism must collapse of its own weight and internal contradictions , these China critics just counsel patience . Don ’ t worry , the collapse is coming . There is little evidence that if the “ reformers ” gained power they would not continue their practice of power economics and goal of dominating national power industries . Some alternative history advocates have explored what would have happened if the United Kingdom had supported the assassination of Hitler , surmising that the Nazi replacement leader would not have been as militarily aggressive . Today , related to the view that China is on autopilot to self-destruct is the view that it is Xi Jinping that is the problem and when he leaves power , China will go back to normal cooperation . They assert that things were workable before him and when he and those in his camp lose power , as they surely must , conflict will significantly lesson . Perhaps the best example of this is from “ The Longer Telegram ” report , wherein the author wrote that : the central focus of an effective US and allied China strategy must be directed at the internal fault lines of domestic Chinese politics in general and concerning Xi ’ s leadership in particular . A fundamental error of US strategy has been to attack China as a whole , thereby enabling Xi ’ s leadership to circle the wagons within Chinese politics around the emotional pull of Chinese nationalism and civilizational pride . Just as significant an error has been to crudely attack the Chinese Communist Party itself . However , the political reality is that the party is divided on Xi ’ s leadership where he threatens the lives , careers , and deeply held policy positions of many within its senior political echelons . [ 194 ] He went on to write that “ all US political and policy responses to China ’ s current strategy should be focused through the single lens of Xi himself. ” [ 195 ] The 2019 Open Letter authors agree , stating , : “ Efforts to isolate China will simply weaken those Chinese intent on developing a more humane and tolerant society. ” [ 196 ] They went on to write , “ The United States should encourage Chinese participation in new or modified global regimes in which rising powers have a greater voice. ” [ 197 ] In other words , let ’ s not rock the boat and the “ anti-Xi ’ s ” will emerge and we can get back to friendly , win-win relations . Whether CCP reformers can gain power is beyond the scope of this report . Given Xi ’ s Marxist-Leninist extremism , it certainly couldn ’ t hurt . But to assume that the problem is Xi and not the inherent logic and goals of the CCP expressed since its very formation is to naïvely misinterpret China ’ s long-term goals . Deng Xiaoping had the same goals as Xi ; he just knew that he had to bide his time and hide his light . There is little evidence that if the “ reformers ” gained power they would not continue their practice of power economics and goal of dominating national power industries . They might do it in more subtle and less aggressive ways because they would believe that it was a better way to achieve their goal , but domination would still be their goal . There is a related strategy that some hold on to and that is to wait until the CCP is finally replaced . Perhaps this is possible if enough Chinese become truly middle class and the then current generation can ’ t remember China ’ s abject poverty . However , unlike Japan , Taiwan , and South Korea , which shifted to democracy when they got to a certain level of development , the United States is not directly influencing and pressing China to open up and become democratic . And the CCP appears to want to hold on to power vastly more than Asian Tiger autocrats did . More fundamentally , assuming that China eventually follows the democratic path of other Asian Tigers , by then the techno-economic war will long be over , with the United States and the West having lost much of their national power industry base . A vast techno-industrial destruction would be left in the wake . Unchecked , China could very well take over the global semiconductor industry , the chemical industry , AI , electronics , robotics , aerospace , biopharmaceuticals , precision instruments , and more . Chamberlin ’ s deal with Hitler was premised on the notion that Hitler only wanted to reunite former German territory . That may have been right in the West ; it definitely was not in the East , as anyone who had read Mein Kampf would have understood . Today , there is a similar strategic response , especially from European policymakers . Many in the EU believe that the CCP has no desire for global strategic industry dominance ; it simply wants its own strategic industries , just like Europe wants to not be dependent on Trump ’ s America . The EU Parliament has written that China ’ s “ drive for ‘ self-reliance ’ in strategic sectors aims to lessen dependence on foreign technology , bolstering resilience and reducing vulnerability. ” [ 198 ] The problem with this view is twofold . First , China is achieving that by closing its markets to foreign companies , something Europe is not willing to do in response to China ’ s mercantilism because it still believes in the vision of the WTO . Second , and more importantly , the CCP wants domination , not just self-reliance . Self-reliance lessens its dependency on adversaries . Domination gives it leverage over adversaries . The CCP ’ s entire Belt and Road and “ going out ” strategies are premised on attack and conquer , not just industrial defense of its homeland . Many in the EU believe that the CCP has no desire for global strategic industry dominance ; it simply wants its own strategic industries , just like Europe wants to not be dependent on Trump ’ s America . Before World War II , the French military high command and political leadership assumed that its forces were superior to Germany ’ s . It had more men under arms , its tanks were considered superior , and it had the Maginot Line . This led both the civilian and military leadership to become overconfident , failing to spend money to rearm . At the same time , it led the French military to become complacent in strategy , planning to fight a long , protracted war , not a response to Guderian ’ s blitzkrieg tank pincer formations . [ 199 ] Today ’ s version of this is widely believed in U.S. foreign policy circles . It holds that China hawks overstate Chinese capabilities and that the United States has enormous strengths that will lead us to automatically prevail in techno-economic competition . Jude Blanchette and Ryan Hass exemplify this view : Even with its many shortcomings and vulnerabilities , the United States continues to command a strategic depth that China fundamentally lacks : a unique combination of economic vitality , global military superiority , remarkable human capital , and a political system designed to promote the correction of errors . The resilient and adaptable U.S. economy has the world ’ s deepest and most liquid capital markets and unparalleled influence over the global financial system . The United States continues to attract top global talent , including many Chinese nationals now fleeing their country ’ s autocratic political environment . Put plainly , the United States still has a vital edge over China in terms of economic dynamism , global influence , and technological innovation . [ 200 ] They wrote in answer to the question , “ Is China destined to be an economic superpower ? ” : No . China has made huge , genuine strides in the past four decades , becoming dominant in manufacturing , prominent in many supply chains , and a leader in several high-tech sectors . However , China ’ s economy has major structural challenges that will constrain growth , and its current economic strategy , which is rooted in pursuing technology leadership , is depressing growth due to industrial-policy waste and growing tensions with trading partners . Going forward , China could encounter a crisis , muddle through with low growth , or revive growth with a more market-oriented strategy . As reports in this series have definitely shown that is simply wishful thinking that relies on ideological platitudes and not on careful analysis of firms , industries and innovation systems . The preponderance of evidence suggests that China has vastly more manufacturing capabilities than America , including and especially in national power industries , and is making much faster progress in innovation . [ 201 ] It is common for supporters of the view of U.S. superiority to point to U.S. universities , venture capital , high-skill immigration , and entrepreneurial culture as inherent sources of superiority . Many even still cling to the notion that U.S. manufacturing is strong . Professor and commentator Jerry Harr reflected this view when he wrote , “ Examining U.S. manufacturing competitiveness today , one finds that the United States maintains a formidable position in global manufacturing despite facing intensifying international competition. ” [ 202 ] Yet , comparing U.S. advanced industry output with China ’ s shows how far behind the United States is . [ 203 ] Most U.S. holders of free-market doctrine dismiss the China threat because they believe that free-market economies are inherently superior to more planned economies . A related view comes from CSIS . Its lead China analyst informed , “ The United States needs to remember that it has not fallen behind China. ” [ 204 ] But nowhere on the CSIS China Power project website is any analysis of China ’ s attempts to master advanced technology industries or any assessment of its progress and success . And to the extent it discusses China ’ s actions in this realm , it largely suggests that it will fail , presumably just as it has done in steel , EVs , batteries , drones , telecom equipment , solar panels , and high-speed rail . [ 205 ] Most U.S. holders of free-market doctrine dismiss the China threat because they believe that free-market economies are inherently superior to more planned economies . As such , there is no way we can lose , unless we become more like China . John Tamny , editor of RealClearMarkets , wrote , “ The overblown China panic serves as a reminder of why the U.S. must maintain the market-friendly norms that have long made it the envy of the world. ” [ 206 ] Box 3 : U.S . Optimism : Command of Commerce : America ’ s Enduring Power Advantage Over China One of the more important questions to get right is whether the United States or China has more techno-economic and trade leverage over the other and what the trend in that dynamic is going . A new book , Command of Commerce , addresses this issue . [ 207 ] As the title suggests , it ’ s not an even , close contest : America dominates . But the authors ’ methods and analysis are fundamentally flawed . First , their key claim for U.S. superiority is that U.S. multinationals have a much larger share of profits than Chinese do . But as noted , that ’ s largely because Chinese firms are willing to accept lower profits ( in part because of government subsidies ) in order to capture global market share . U.S. firms are not . Moreover , a higher share of Chinese firms are in more competitive segments where profits are low . For example , the profitability of electronics assembly firms is quite low compared with software firms . Does that not mean that being able to make things is not important to national power ? They also see profits from sales and marketing as key indicators of national strength . For them , an American firm that outsources low-margin production overseas but makes high profits because of sales and marketing boosts U.S. power . No , it weakens it , even if they argue that higher profits help a nation . They do , but profits are a small share of national income , around 14 percent in the United States . [ 208 ] Second , like so many U.S. foreign policy and economic experts , the authors focus on firm nationality and not production location . In the authors ’ analysis , a firm such as Boeing or Intel could offshore all its production to China and U.S. power would not diminish because these are U.S. firms . In fact , they argued , power would increase because the USG could order these U.S. firms to stop production in China at any time . But in a war , what matters is not production in other nations , especially your adversaries ; it ’ s production at home . They wrote , “ For a nation to be able to transform its manufacturing output into geopolitical leverage it needs to have significant influence over the more complicated manufacturing and design activities that feed into most products , and it needs to have control over where those products are sold. ” [ 209 ] In other words , they asserted that a U.S. company that designs a product but has it made in Chinese factories , and then sold through the U.S. company ’ s distribution channel has geopolitical leverage . At one level , it does . The USG can tell it to stop producing in China , although that would mean major job loss and possible bankruptcy of the U.S. company , as sales would crater before it could establish new production facilities somewhere else . But it also means that the U.S. does not have this production domestically . To the extent the industry is dual use , or even enabling , that absence weakens U.S. defense production . And to the extent the United States relies on the products made by a U.S. company in China , it would be cutting off its nose to spite its face . Third , the authors did rightly point to a key metric as allied production strength ( even if profits are their key measure ) . But it ’ s not at all clear that our allies are really our allies when it comes to China . South Korea and Japan are increasingly split in their loyalties , while the EU , in the face of Trump ’ s tariffs , is tilting East , not West . Indeed , the EU has still not cut off sales of Huawei 5G equipment within Europe because some EU nations want to save a few euros by buying Chinese . And overall , EU leaders are loathe to give up Chinese markets , which explains why they do so little to embrace U.S. export controls on China . [ 210 ] Fourth , the authors ignored important measures . They failed to mention that in 2024 the United States ran a $ 1.3 trillion trade deficit , with $ 300 billion of that with China . China ran a $ 900 billion merchandise trade surplus . [ 211 ] Over the last decade , U.S. manufacturing value-added output has grown more slowly than GDP and 14 of 19 major industries saw absolute decline . [ 212 ] Moreover , U.S. manufacturing productivity has been stagnant since the early 2010s . [ 213 ] While there does not appear to be easily accessible data on Chinese labor productivity growth , overall Chinese productivity growth has been significantly higher than that of the United States . [ 214 ] The fact that China now has installed 74 percent more industrial robots per manufacturing worker than the United States has , and installed 7.3 times more in 2013—an even more impressive feat given that Chinese manufacturing wages are significantly lower , which reduces the ROI of robotics installation—suggests strong competitive advantage . [ 215 ] Fifth , the authors finally got to the real measures of power when they looked at OECD ’ s value-added output in various industries . The problem is that they considered only high-tech industries as important—not motor vehicles , where tank production is classified ; or shipbuilding , where aircraft carriers are classified ; not steel , which weapons systems use ; etc . And even more , they included telecommunications services and professional services sectors that have no bearing on national power and leverage . If the Chinese were to cut off all exports to us , we ’ d still have these two perfectly functioning sectors , because they are not traded , they are domestic . When looking at traded high-tech sectors , as the authors defined them , the OECD data shows that in 2022 ( they used 2020 data ) , the U.S. share was 29.5 percent , with China ’ s 18.5 percent , a significant U.S. lead . [ 216 ] But leaving out the two nontraded sectors , and the nongoods sector of IT and information services , China ’ s share jumps to 27.7 % while the U.S. share falls to 20.7 percent . [ 217 ] Moreover , a core mistake the authors made is that they presented a static snapshot of China . They were absolutely correct that in certain sectors such as aerospace , drugs , semiconductors , and equipment that China lags behind the United States . And that does give the United States some breathing room . But in all these industries and more , China ’ s progress is rapid . For example , from 2016 to 2022 , China ’ s output in other transportation , which includes aerospace , increased four times faster than U.S. value-added output , while its computer and semiconductor output increase twice as fast . And while the United States government is cutting federal R & D , the Chinese government is expanding it . They also argued that Chinese GDP is exaggerated in official CCP figures . This may very well be the case , but it is not the key point if one is considering the global war for advanced industries . If China ’ s personal services , retail , and legal services market is not expanding , that means lower GDP , but it has no effect on national power industries . Sixth , the book goes all out to make its case . Case in point , the authors reported that because of the U.S. export sanctions , Huawei ’ s global phone share fell from 11 percent in 2000 to 3.5 percent in 2024 . They were either not aware of , or ignored the fact , that about 4 percentage points of that drop was due to Huawei spinning off its lower-end phone business to a new company , Honor . And they overlooked that Huawei is not the world ’ s largest telecom equipment manufacturer , and its global market share for telecom equipment increased from 29 percent in early 2018 to 31 percent by 2024 . [ 218 ] Finally , the authors pointed to the fact that the United Staes has used export controls to supposedly hobble China ( which they did not in the case of Huawei ) while China has refrained from trying to do the same to the United States as evidence that it is weaker technologically and has little leverage . Because of this , the authors amazingly argued for even more export controls against China to weaken it . This betrays a fundamental reading of China . China has no interest in cutting off sales of its products to the United States , because unlike the USG , it realizes that more Chinese sales strengthen its companies and weaken America ’ s . Moreover , China still benefits from U.S. investment in China , and the technology transfer it gets . It doesn ’ t close its markets to foreign investment until the industry in question is dominant . It is biding its time to gain even more from foreign firms . Chamberlain probably rightly believed that there was little that France and the United Kingdom could do to deter or weaken Hitler , so he engaged in appeasement . Today , that is a common strategy toward China proposed by many in the foreign policy establishment . The 2019 Open Letter advocates this : “ U.S . opposition will not prevent the continued expansion of the Chinese economy , a greater global market share for Chinese companies and an increase in China ’ s role in world affairs. ” [ 219 ] On what basis do they make this assertion , other than they value engagement above all else ? Why wouldn ’ t a strategy of limiting Chinese exports and working with our allies to do the same result in China having less global market share instead of more ? However , for them , even if we could do something to limit China ’ s rise , we shouldn ’ t because it would hurt ourselves . The authors went on to write that “ the United States can not significantly slow China ’ s rise without damaging itself. ” [ 220 ] China scholar Susan Shirk agreed , stating that “ there is no objective measure to suggest that a dramatic reduction in the extent or quality of China ’ s participation in global commerce and finance would do anything except harm economic growth in the United States. ” [ 221 ] A Brookings report in 2022 expressed the same sentiment that the fight will be costly , so it will hurt us . It states that : Fully extracting Chinese firms from Department of Defense supply chains , including those that produce rare earth minerals for example , would likely be infeasible , and may discourage innovation by imposing costs that would likely be insurmountable for start-up companies . [ 222 ] It goes on the criticize the idea that the United States should produce more key goods that we compete for with China , presumably because it would entail the dreaded “ industrial policy ” and because it would cost money : While it is reasonable to geographically diversify this particular portfolio , the imperative should not be applied more broadly to the high-tech industry overall . The goal of subsidies , tax breaks , and loan guarantee programs should be to incentivize greater supply chain resilience in sectors that are vital for the provision of necessary public goods ; it should not be to strengthen the balance sheet of domestic firms or increase domestic production of high-tech goods and services per se . [ 223 ] And above all , the authors worry that tariffs “ increase the costs of goods for consumers. ” [ 224 ] Why not eliminate the U.S. defense budget because it raises costs for taxpayers ? We would be much better off spending money on consumer goods than defense goods if we didn ’ t have to worry about national defense . And besides , this broad assertion of self-damage , made with no real logic , is certainly true with some actions , but not with others . Limiting the imports of national power industry goods or services produced unfairly helps , not hurts the United States . After WWII , the entire U.S. defense and foreign policy establishment focused on Europe , largely ignoring Asia . The belief was that if Stalin attacked , he would go West , not Southeast . But Stalin , and Mao , had other ideas , giving the green light to North Korea ’ s Marxist-Leninist dictator Kim Il-Sung to invade South Korea . The analogy to today is the notion of derisking : a denial of the China threat and capabilities . Popular in the EU—which abhors having to take a stand against China and can ’ t dare to consider that the old vision of globalization ( a world where no nation other than America needs to spend money on defense ) is dead , and wants to sell as much to China as it can—the idea is that it ’ s only a few industries that we have to fight for to “ derisk ” from China . [ 225 ] In a recent EU report on derisking , the EU Parliament wrote : According to Ursula von der Leyen , de-risking is not exclusively vis-à-vis China , as it is about ‘ managing the risks we see , addressing excessive dependencies through diversification of our supply chains . This is a positive communication move , as it has the potential to be better perceived in China than the triptych ( China as a cooperation partner-economic competitor , systemic rival . [ 226 ] Jake Sullivan also supported this strategy when he proposed , “ De-risking and diversifying , not decoupling. ” [ 227 ] In other words , the EU above all does not want to make the CCP mad by calling it a systematic rival . The term derisking allows , the EU believes , the limiting of some dependencies on China while not making it so angry that it limits EU sales to China , something the EU puts at the top of its agenda with China . The EU report goes on to state , “ Trade and openness are deeply engrained within the European project , and the more moderate de-risking concept is meant as a way to find a better equilibrium between seizing opportunities and managing risks. ” [ 228 ] The EU above all does not want to make the CCP mad by calling it a systematic rival . The term derisking allows , the EU believes , the limiting of some dependencies on China while not making it so angry that it limits EU sales to China , something the EU puts at the top of its agenda with China . “ Seizing opportunities ” is a euphemism for selling more to China , especially if it comes at the expense of U.S. exports , while welcoming Chinese factories to be built in the EU . [ 229 ] The report goes on to narrow the scope for derisking , even embracing more dependency on China : In many fields , European firms also look to the Chinese market and Chinese partners not only for research and development opportunities , but also as a source of technology . Ultimately , the de-risking approach proposed by the Commission may be considered one of risk mitigation or management , rather than a cleansing exercise . Indeed , many companies , Member States and even the Commission seek generally to maintain avenues of economic and technological cooperation , ensuring that China remains a partner for Europe in areas that do not constitute a palpable risk for Europe ’ s security . [ 230 ] The EU also defines derisking not as only with China , but amazingly also with the United States : “ De-risking is strongly tied to the EU Economic Security Strategy that goes beyond China. ” [ 231 ] And the EU seeks to derisk from the United States , as the recent “ Draghi report ” suggests . [ 232 ] When it talks about strategic dependencies in the IT hardware sector , it talks more about the United States than it does about China . In the fact , the report is only partially focused on China , with much of the discussion on the United States ’ techno-economic capabilities . Finally , there are a range of strategic approaches that largely ignore either attacking Chinese capabilities or defending against its techno-economic aggression , and instead focus only on ways the United States can improve . France relied on defense against Hitler . It failed . A similar approach is in vogue in the United States today . In a report for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Jon Bateman argued that “ the primary effort should be ‘ offensive ’ : new investments and incentives to bolster and diversify innovation pathways , supply chains , talent pipelines , and revenue models in strategic technology areas. ” [ 233 ] In a 2018 article in Foreign Affairs , Kurt Campbell and Ely Ratner , former members of the Biden administration . argued : The starting point for a better approach is a new degree of humility about the United States ’ ability to change China . Neither seeking to isolate and weaken it nor trying to transform it for the better should be the lodestar of U.S. strategy in Asia . Washington should instead focus more on its own power and behavior , and the power and behavior of its allies and partners . [ 234 ] Even if the United States had the political will to come together to fight the war and the willingness to commit the significant resources to spur domestic competitiveness , that would still not be enough . A Biden interim national security guideline issued in March 2021 echoes this : “ [ O ] ur enduring advantages will allow us to prevail in strategic competition with China or any other nation. ” [ 235 ] It went on to note , “ The most effective way for America to out-compete a more assertive and authoritarian China over the long-term is to invest in our people , our economy , and our democracy. ” [ 236 ] Even if the United States had the political will to come together to fight the war and the willingness to commit the significant resources to boost domestic competitiveness , that would still not be enough . The CCP ’ s pockets and tools will always be deeper and sharper than America ’ s . In the U.S. Civil War , General McLellan let Robert E. Lee intimidate him and set the stage for where to fight . McLelland reacted and retreated . But Ulysses S. Grant did not , famously stating , “ I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer. ” [ 237 ] McLellan ’ s thinking is what passes for much of U.S. competitiveness and tech policy thinking today . Well , we can ’ t compete with China in “ x ” ( e.g. , drones , telecom equipment , chemicals , and even manufacturing generally ) , so we will retreat to higher ground of “ x. ” Usually , “ x ” is AI . Well , China is good at manufacturing , but we are good at AI , so we can let them have manufacturing ; we will win in AI . Some justify this by hyping AI as the secret weapon in the techno-economic war—akin to Hitler ’ s jet fighters and V-2 rockets . Once the United States gets to artificial general intelligence ( AGI ) or even artificial superintelligence ( ASI ) , the war is over , and the United States has won . AGI will give us utmost power to outcompete China everywhere . As one study puts it : The contest between China and the United States to harness the potential of artificial intelligence ( AI ) has become this generation ’ s defining technological rivalry . The report concludes that America ’ s ability to shape AI ’ s trajectory depends on extending its technological advantage over China as much as possible . Rather than focusing on unlikely cooperation , the United States must pursue decisive technical superiority fueled by a vision for American AI that advances democratic values and global development . Effectively managing the fraught issues on AI ’ s horizon can strengthen the United States ’ soft power and technological advantage ; failing to do so risks derailing American AI progress and ceding ground to Beijing . [ 238 ] It is a seductive notion , but likely as wrong as Hitler ’ s betting the war on Wunderwaffen ( wonder weapons ) rather than more tanks . First , China is making rapid progress in AI . It ’ s not like the 1990s with “ Wintelism ” ( Windows and Intel ) and U.S. dominance in personal computing and then the Internet . China is in the game . Second , it is a bet-the-farm risk that AI is the superweapon of the techno-economic war . What if AI is just another normal , albeit important technology ? A technology that improves production in many sectors , but does not transform the world like never before . In that case , AI will not be able to preserve our national power industries such as drugs , aerospace , chips , machine tools , chemicals , etc . That , rather than sci-fi stories about ASI is the much more likely outcome , at least in the next quarter century when this conflict really matters . A related story is that it ’ s not just AI , but rather a host of emerging technologies that will save us . Through the magic of Silicon Valley , America will lead in the industries of the future : blockchain , humanoid robots , quantum , synthetic biology , 3D printing , and of course AI . Biden ’ s Secretary of State Antony Blinken agreed , identifying six technologies as core to the U.S. competitive strategy : “ microelectronics , advanced computing and quantum technologies , artificial intelligence , biotechnology and biomanufacturing , advanced telecommunications , and clean energy technologies. ” [ 239 ] ( Although the administration never bothered to explain why clean energy is strategic when we have lots of dirty energy . ) It seems like advocates of this view get their understanding of technology from Wired Magazine , focused on the cool , cutting-edge stuff , much of what they experience in their own lives . No need to fight to win the silicon chip wars ; just develop the next generation of processors such as neuromorphic computing and the like . [ 240 ] No need to win the compute wars ; just jump ahead to quantum . Don ’ t worry about the chemical sector ; embrace “ synthetic biology. ” [ 241 ] And don ’ t forget , we have Silicon Valley ; we can afford to cede the rest of the territory as long as we have the commanding heights of the Valley . This wrongly implies that atom-based industries—or “ deep tech ” —such as aerospace , vehicles , machine tools , and chemicals are not strategic . Moreover , for all the wonder of Silicon Valley , it ’ s just not that big , accounting for just 1.5 percent of U.S. GDP . [ 242 ] The problems with this approach are similar to those of AI . First , capacity in breakthrough technologies often comes from leadership in prior technologies . Biotech breakthroughs depend on strong , large U.S. biopharmaceutical companies . 6G might come from startups , but more likely it will come from incumbents such as Qualcomm and Ericsson . Quantum could come from new entrants , but existing IT and computer companies are more likely to develop it . Second , the United States has a long history of leading in innovative breakthroughs only to lose production to other nations . Why would this time be any different if the fundamental U.S. strategy and policy remain the same ? In fact , with China poised to hoover up U.S. breakthrough knowledge and commercialize it in China , one would expect even more of the same pattern . China is fighting hard in all of them , and some of these industries have a very similar dynamic to ones that the United States has already lost to China . The United States has a long history of leading in innovative breakthroughs only to lose production to other nations . Why would this time be any different if the fundamental U.S. strategy and policy remain the same ? Third , there is no reason to expect that the United States will win all these sectors , especially with the deep cuts in federal funding for research . It was much easier for the United States to win past tech breakthroughs when the federal government funded such a massive amount of research . It no longer does . Finally , there are many sectors , such as machine tools , basic chemicals , and others that are strategic but not cutting-edge , cool , high-tech . These and others are less likely to experience breakthrough innovations that could launch new companies in the United States . Another strategy , related to the AI and emerging technologies ones , is to rely on some kind of vague , promised scientific innovations . Presumably , this pays off in commercial success in the United States and in strategic industries and technologies . In a report for CSIS , Rand ’ s Mike Mazzar wrote , “ The domestic foundation for success in turn has three major components : nurturing a supportive ecosystem for science and technology , promoting diffusion , and managing the wider social effects of technology for competitive advantage. ” [ 243 ] His first component for U.S. success is , “ The domestic U.S. foundations of scientific and technological innovation , including the supporting science and technology ecosystem , must remain at a world-class level. ” [ 244 ] This is a widely held view that a better science system will go a long way toward saving us . In a 2022 speech , National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan stated , “ Advancements in science and technology are poised to define the geopolitical landscape of the 21st century . They will generate game-changers in health and medicine , food security , and clean energy . We ’ ll see leap-ahead breakthroughs and new industries that drive our prosperity. ” [ 245 ] In his otherwise excellent book , David Shambaugh reflected this conventional wisdom when he wrote , “ We also need to invest considerable sums into basic scientific research in order to maintain all American comparative advantage in innovation. ” [ 246 ] This is an appealing and safe framing because it doesn ’ t require a dreaded strategic industry strategy that involves picking winners . It doesn ’ t even involve the painful task of telling U.S. scientists that they have to do more work related to the national interest . Rather , it ’ s grounded in the more widely accepted view that government can play the key role in innovation by funding scientific research that U.S. scientists choose to focus on . But it also reflects a shallow and misguided view of how innovation takes place and even what it is . Innovation is not scientific discovery , something that is now available widely around the globe . Innovation is the successful bringing to the market of a new product , process , or service , and beating the competition while doing it . Innovation doesn ’ t come from STEM workers or science funding . It comes from organizations with embedded knowledge . That requires a deep understanding of organizational production and corporate strategy . And sophisticated organizations anywhere on the planet can absorb a significant portion of the science breakthroughs funded by the USG . Exactly how does the U.S. military fight wars with the best lawyers , consultants , accountants , and universities ? The ultimate retreat is to say that no particular part of land is strategic enough to defend . This is the view of the “ potato chips , computers chips , what ’ s the difference ? ” group . In this view , all industries are the same . Who cares if America manufactures anything ; it ’ s dirty and dull anyway ? We will take the commanding heights of global finance , business consulting , content , and higher education . A report from CSIS summarizes the view : “ What is missing from both strategies for competing with China is a focus on what is too often the unsung driver of U.S. competitiveness : services. ” [ 247 ] Exactly how does the U.S. military fight wars with the best lawyers , consultants , accountants , and universities ? But these are soothing visions . No need to fight . You walk away from the aggressor . You do better things than the aggressor . Still another distraction from the war is the view by elites , especially global business elites and fellow travelers in the academic and punditry , which is that the problem is with the West and that only a new kind of capitalism will save it . Besides implying a self-loathing of Western capitalism , this view is a major distraction from the task at hand of not letting the West lose in national power industry war . One example is the famous ( or infamous ) Trilateral Commission , whose “ Task Force on Global Capitalism in Transition ” argued that it is Western capitalism that is inherently problematic , something that is remarkably similar to what Xi Jinping says . [ 248 ] The Task Force has argued , “ There are growing concerns about whether market-based economies will be able to adequately address climate change , the disruptions triggered by the digital revolution , and rising inequalities . Moving toward a more sustainable and inclusive capitalism is thus a defining challenge of our age. ” [ 249 ] In other words , climate and inequality demand a new kind of capitalism . Maybe even capitalism with Chinese characteristics ? In fact , the Task Force has lauded the CCP ’ s efforts as fellow reform travelers : “ Even China—the largest beneficiary of global capitalism over the past 40 years—launched a campaign in 2021 to curb ‘ the disorderly expansion of capital. ’ ” [ 250 ] It appears that they did not know that the disorder the CCP was trying to put in order was from companies not investing in ensuring Chinese global dominance in national power industries . The Task Force has even stated that the Chinese economy arguably meets the criteria for a capitalist system . Hence , China is in the club with America seeking “ the transition in global capitalism ” to a happy , clean , more equal sixth phase . And of course , the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) is at the forefront of this kind of self-flagellation . Former director Klaus Schwab recently stated , “ We now have a window of opportunity to create this Global Reset which we all need . This Global Reset is necessary because we have seen how our policies which we pursued before the coronavirus struck us because those policies do not create the necessary inclusion of society necessary for harmonious societal development. ” [ 251 ] Was he not aware that the term “ harmonious societal development ” is a CCP global talking point to attack the Western model of development ? [ 252 ] It ’ s worth adding that this was from a person who told a Chinese forum , “ We are coming out , thanks also to the leadership of China in terms of fighting the pandemic. ” [ 253 ] And he was “ happy to see China putting high priorities on developing its ‘ fourth industrial revolution ’ capabilities. ” [ 254 ] Sounding like China Daily , WEF touts that China is “ driving global growth , ” “ reshaping food systems , ” and powering a “ remarkable green transition. ” It is even helping the world with its rare earth minerals policies . WEF sees China as no different than any other nation , except it ’ s bigger , provides more benefits , and is more committed to free trade than America is . One WEF article about China at Davos 2025 states , “ China showcased its transition from traditional growth drivers to a new model centered on domestic consumption , advanced manufacturing , and green transformation , while emphasizing continued commitment to opening up amid geopolitical tensions. ” [ 255 ] Yes , that would be the “ new ” model on domestic consumption the CCP has been promising without delivering for the last 15 years . Yes , if you consider green transition to be China ’ coal-fired power plant construction hitting a 10-year high . [ 256 ] And yes , if it ’ s possible to commit to opening up while simultaneously shutting out more and more foreign companies from its markets . And the writer went on to castigate America for being closed : The recent US Department of Defense designation of CATL as a “ Chinese military company ” highlighted the challenges ahead for Chinese companies operating globally . While Chinese officials and business leaders consistently emphasized openness and collaboration , there was clear recognition of the need to navigate an increasingly complex international environment . [ 257 ] Sounding like China Daily , WEF touts that China is “ driving global growth , ” “ reshaping food systems , ” and powering a “ remarkable green transition. ” It is even helping the world with its rare earth minerals policies . [ 258 ] ( True , if helping means putting the rest of the world ’ s rare earth miners and processors out of business . ) And the author , a professor educated in China and now teaching in Australia , has argued , “ A more balanced narrative is the first step towards a coherent , globally coordinated policy response. ” [ 259 ] That is CCP speak for , “ Stop criticizing us. ” The pacifist Quincy Institute agrees , blaming capitalism for U.S.-China competition : The United States and China are trapped in zero-sum economic competition today because neoliberal globalization consistently failed to create the broad growth that would allow prosperity in all countries… The U.S. and China are thus locked in a zero-sum struggle that is distracting both sides from the root causes of the conflict and strengthening the forces of authoritarianism and nationalism in both countries . [ 260 ] Ahh , if only the United States abandoned “ neoliberalism , ” the CCP could get back to what it really wants to do : boost the Chinese proletariat . In WWII , Krupp was the major defense contractor in Germany , and Hitler relied on it for building superweapons to win the war . Today , there is a similar myopic focus of just reforming defense procurement in order to address the China threat . U.S. industrial policy for defense goods was seen as necessary because markets would fail . But an industrial policy for dual-use and enabling industries ? That ’ s a whole other matter . Much of the discussion of national power industry competition with China focuses narrowly on the defense industrial base and the myriad of reforms offered to improve it . These range from more competition , more procurement from the civilian sector , multi-year procurement , more foreign military sales , more allied cooperation and specialization , and of course , more flexible contracting and funding mechanisms . [ 261 ] It ’ s not that these proposals are not useful , they very well may be . But the belief that we can not lose the power industry war with China by only improving how DOD spends its procurement and R & D budgets is wishful thinking . In the first half of the 20th century , the Swiss had a great strategy : let the rest of Europe destroy itself by making sure that the costs of invading mountainous Switzerland were very high and that Switzerland would stay neutral . The problem with this strategy was that it could have let either the Nazis or the Soviets control Europe . But still , the redoubt strategy is attractive and seductive . Many neo-protectionist Republicans want to erect high mountains from tariffs and therefore couldn ’ t care less about what other nations , including China , do . Tariffs will ensure that the American economy will be self-sufficient and that China can do it little harm , at least economically . In this view , while a country such as Canada or the United Kingdom couldn ’ t do that because their GDP is too small , the U.S. market is big enough to let every industry comfortably produce and thrive , as long as they are protected by high enough tariff walls . The problems with this strategy are many . Most importantly , it ensures that China wins the global war . It may not “ occupy our land ” ( e.g. , hollow out our strategic industries ) , but it is likely to occupy the rest of the world . The United States would find itself living in a world where our influence would be minimal : no country would want to risk alienating the hegemon of Beijing . Just look at Europe now , tiptoeing around in fear of aggravating the CCP ( or India , going to Beijing to get closer ) . Imagine how obsequious Europe would be without the United States to protect it . A protectionist redoubt is a prescription for U.S. national power industry decline . Second , most strategic industries that are technologically advanced , such as semiconductors , pharmaceuticals , aerospace , fine chemicals , and more , require global market share to survive . The fixed cost is too high to hope to recover them in a market even as large as the United States ’ . A protectionist redoubt is a prescription for U.S. national power industry decline . Just as in World WWII and the Cold War with the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc , the only effective strategy is to stand and fight collectively . We have to take a stand . Like General Grant in the battle of the Wilderness : no more retreat . not one step back , only attacking the next day . Or like in World War II , when the Nazis were relentless in their advance and the Soviets had their backs to the wall , Stalin issued his famous not one step back order . While it meant hundreds of thousands of Soviet military deaths , it also meant that the back of the Wehrmacht would be broken . Accepting that this is the only acceptable high-level strategy means a fundamental reexamination and reformulation of past institutional arrangements and policies . This means disruption and rethinking past assumptions about globalization , financial capitalism , the role of government , and the regulatory state . And it means embracing the development and implementation of a strategy to not lose the war . In this sense , the Kennan concept of containment is the right one . Kennan understood the threat to the West from Soviet communist expansionism . And he knew that the ability of the West to defeat the Soviets , especially militarily , was minimal—at least until the Soviet Union began to fall significantly far behind the United States as they started doing in the 1970s . As such , the strategy was to limit the ability of the Soviet bloc to develop ( through export controls and limited trade ) while limiting its ability to expand into allied nations , and finally working to gain the hearts and minds of the unaligned world . Today , the United States does not have the capability to defeat China from a techno-economic perspective . We might have been 20 years ago , when the techno-economic capabilities ratio was much more in our favor , but it no longer is . While various export controls and other means might throw a wrench into Chinese progress ( delaying them and raising costs ) , there is no evidence or reason to believe that it can keep the CCP from its ultimate goal of techno-economic domination . The goal has to be , first and foremost , not letting the CCP win the battles for strategic industries in allied nations . The reason is simple : more sales for its strategic industry firms means more innovation and lower costs for China . Fewer sales for our strategic industry firms mean less innovation and higher costs for us . An overarching strategy for how to do that is laid out ahead , but for now , suffice to say it involves offense ( supporting domestic companies in their battles ) and defense ( limiting Chinese companies ’ access to our markets ) . Unless the United States rejects both free-market-based consumer welfare economics and progressive , quasi-socialist worker economics and instead adopts a national power economics doctrine and framework , it will lose the war . Taking this seriously and to heart has major implications for the nation . First , it means that we have to give less attention to many of the political hot-button issues that the Right and the Left are willing to go the ramparts for . And it means , just as in the Cold War , that the American people and our leaders need to admit and bear the very serious costs that engaging in this war will cost . JFK said that “ we shall pay any price , bear any burden , meet any hardship , support any friend , oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty. ” [ 262 ] Few Americans likely believe that today ; in fact , many are ambivalent about the very value of liberty . As such , setting that as the core strategy is paramount . But unless the United States rejects both free-market-based consumer welfare economics and progressive , quasi-socialist worker economics and instead adopts a national power economics doctrine and framework , it will lose the war . Two economic doctrines compete for U.S. dominance : free-market , consumer welfare economics and neo-New Deal worker-oriented progressivism . Most economic policy , including trade , technology , tax and budget , and regulatory policy is grounded in the discipline of economics . In America ’ s case , this is neo-classical economics . Another term for it is consumer welfare-focused economics because the goal is maximizing consumer welfare , ideally by allowing the free reign of market forces enabling the efficient allocation of resources . In this frame , policies are usually judged by their effects on consumers and free markets . The free trade , free-market think tank The Peterson Institute reflects that view when it argued that : the United States can not and should not have as its policy goal greater self-sufficiency across a wide range of activities . The nation—and the manufacturing sector in particular—is too deeply engaged in international trade to make that advisable . Furthermore , the efficiency gains from this diversification of supply are substantial . [ 263 ] And in this view , efficiency is maximized when prices are set by natural supply and demand forces in markets . A minimum wage : bad because it substitutes government dictate for market forces and hurts consumers . Tariffs : bad because they substitute government dictate for market forces and hurt consumers . Industry subsidies : bad because they substitute government dictate for market forces and hurt consumers in their role as taxpayers . Company market power : bad because it gives them the ability to limit supply or raise prices in ways that true free markets would not . In conventional economics , consumption is paramount . Trade deficits are actually good because they enable more consumption . No industry is more important than any other because consumer spending determines which industries are important . And foreign subsidization of export industries are good for the United States because they lead to lower prices . If these countries are dumb enough to give us “ discounts ” on their exports , we ’ d be dumb to say no . As such , this doctrine sees limiting Chinese auto imports to the United States as bad economic policy because consumers lose . Ignore the fact that much of China ’ s cost advantage comes from government subsidies and a suppressed currency and that open imports would likely significantly harm U.S. auto producers . And because companies make profits by most efficiently serving consumer needs , strong profits are a reflection of a strong economy . In this theory , the fact that U.S. firms are vastly more profitable than Chinese firms means not only that the U.S. system is better than the Chinese system , but also that the United States is stronger . Indeed , the United States has evolved into a society where it seems that stock prices are the paramount concern . Stocks up , economy strong . Stocks down , economy weak . A Council of Foreign Relations article on China reflects this consensus consumer welfare view : U.S. trade with China has grown enormously in recent decades and is crucial for both countries . Today , China is one of the largest export markets for U.S. goods and services ( second to Mexico ) , and the United States is the top export market for China . This trade—much of which grew after China joined the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) in 2001—has brought lower prices to U.S. consumers and higher profits for U.S. corporations . [ 264 ] Andy Rothman , an American financial advisor in China , argued : C hina drives global economic growth , so a sound bilateral relationship is important to American consumers and workers , as well as to families who are counting on stock market returns to pay for their retirement . In the 10 years through 2019 , China , on average , accounted for about one third of global economic growth . [ 265 ] By definition , national power is an externality . From a consumer-welfare perspective , defense spending is a waste—as are , for the conventional economists , national power industry policies . In this system , if U.S. companies offshore manufacturing or exit from manufacturing altogether , this is optimal , for two reasons . First , by definition , whatever market forces lead to is optimal , as it reflects the most efficient allocation of resources . Second , offshoring must lead to higher profits for firms exiting low-margin industries or business segments . And as we have seen , higher profits are seen as synonymous with a strong economy . If investing in software and information services firms generated higher profits than investing in factories did , then it is American firms that are the smart ones and the American economy that is the strong one . Box 4 : Adam Smith : Wrong and Misinterpreted It ’ s striking that few people seem to think it strange that the core economic thinkers for both today ’ s Left and Right—Karl Marx and Adam Smith , respectively—put pen to paper more than 150 years ago . Maybe antiquity is why their works are treated as scripture . But Marx is far worse than Smith , in retrospect . Most of what he wrote is completely wrong , including his claim that capitalism repeals the laws of competition such that all the fruits of technological progress go to the capitalists . [ 266 ] And of course , his followers were responsible for unspeakable crimes against humanity . While Adam Smith is not as wrong as Marx was , at times , it ’ s a close call . Why does this matter ? Because the principle intellectual grounding today , at least among the Right and Center , in America against a national power industry strategy finds it succor in Smith ’ s 1976 Wealth of Nations . Smith ’ s famous line , “ By pursuing his own interest [ an individual ] frequently promotes that of society the more effectually than when he really intends to promote it , ” has morphed into biblical certainty . [ 267 ] To be sure , the pursuit of individual profit can and often does lead to societal benefit . But this is such a simplistic framing , it ’ s blatant in its obviousness . What about the cases where self-interest is not enough ? This gets to Smith ’ s core error : his disregard of production externalities . Economists define an externalitiy as a side effect or consequence of an industrial or commercial activity that affects other parties without being reflected in the cost of the goods or services involved . If these are minimal , than a Smithian world does produce optimally . But even in Smith ’ s time , they were not minimal—and in a world driven by advanced tehcnology , they are even more ubiquitous and important . The reality is that the success of any one venture depends on the success of many others , both public and private . If an individual in Smith ’ s time wanted to open a pin-making factory , he would have had a hard time if there had had also not been companies making steel and tools to cut the steel . In other words , success of companies depends in part not just on entrepreneurial will and vigor , especially in technologically complex industries , but also on the overall industrial ecosystem . And because companies are indifferent to externalities , by definition—they are external to the firm—relying on firms alone can lead to underperformance . Markets seldom solve externalities on their own . Governments do though . Smtih was also wrong when it came to domestic vs. foreign production . While Smith was accurately describing his times , he did not worry about the negative effect of offshoring production because doing so was quite difficult . Indeed , he wrote that “ every individual endeavors to employ his capital as near home as he can , and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry. ” [ 268 ] But what happens to his laissez-faire model if moving production to Shanghai is as easy as moving it to Sheffield ? In other cases , Smith qualified his statements with important caveats , but these are largely ignored by die-hard free-market , consumer-welfare economists . Even before David Ricardo , Smith argued that it made no sense to produce something domestically when it could be purchased more cheaply from abroad . This obvious insight is treated as Nobel Prize-winning genius and used to inform all of U.S. trade policy . Sure , it makes no sense for the United States to grow coffee , but what about other things such as cars and semiconductors ? It seems as if free-market Smithians never bothered to read : “ There seem , however , to be two cases , in which it will generally be advantage to lay some burden upon foreign , for the encouragement of domestic industry. ” [ 269 ] In other words , Smith did not rule out government action for trade competitiveness , and in fact , downright encouraged it . The first is for defense industry . He wrote , “ The first is when some particular sort of industry is necessary for the defense of the country. ” Given the criticality of the British navy at the time , he used the case of shipbuilding . If he had been writing in the 1920s , he would have mentioned airplanes . As Barnett Corelli wrote regarding The Wealth of Nations , “ This vital distinction was totally lost by nineteenth-century apostles of Free Trade. ” [ 270 ] And , it could be added , by 21st century apostles of free trade in the United States . For Smithians , free markets and free trade , by definition , maximize what Smith termed “ opulence. ” Smith went on to note a second key caveat to free markets and trade : The second case , in which it will generally be advantageous to lay some burden upon foreign countries for the encouragement of domestic industry , is when some tax is imposed at home upon the produce of the latter . In this case , it seems reasonable that an equal tax should be imposed on the like produce of the former . [ 271 ] He wrote that when a foreign nation limits imports of goods , the home nation has an advantage if the other nation should impose some “ duties or prohibitions upon the importation of some or all of their manufacturers into ours. ” [ 272 ] But to be fair , he only proposed that as a tactic to get the foreign nation to reduce its distortions . If they would not , then the home nation should do nothing . Except if the industry were important to national defense . This all gets to the fundamental flaw of Adam Smith ’ s doctrine , which Barnett rightly calls “ ( classical ) liberalism. ” In his book The Decline of British Power , he wrote , “ This swift decline in British vigor at home and the failure to exploit the empire were not owing to some inevitable senescent process of history . They shared a specific cause . That cause was political doctrine ; a doctrine blindly believed in long after it had ceased to correspond with reality. ” [ 273 ] He went on to say : The doctrine was liberalism , which criticized and finally demolished the traditional conception of the nation-state as a collective organism , a community ; and asserted the primacy of the individual . According to liberal thinking , a nation was no more than so many human atoms who happened to live under the same set of laws . From such belief it followed that the State , instead of being the embodiment of a national community as it had been under the Tudors and the Commonwealth , was required to dwindle into a kind of policeman , standing apart from the national life , and with the merely negative task of keeping the free-for-all of individual competition with the bounds of decorum . [ 274 ] He noted that as Adam Smith brought this doctrine to the fore , when it came to the national production system , the doctrine held , “ What was socially necessary could be safely untrusted to spontaneous creation by private initiative. ” [ 275 ] The problem then for Britain was when advanced economies evolved from small production shops with limited technological sophistication to mass production factories of increasing scientific and technological sophistication , Britain was completely unprepared . As Barnett wrote , “ The English therefore entered the industrial era—the era of organization—with a deep-seated horror or organization , the larger the organization the greater the horror. ” [ 276 ] Spoken as a true neo-Brandeisian of the Left or Right would today . We see that in the United States after the rise of traditional liberalism and libertarian , free-market economics in the 1970s . Free-market scholars such as Oliver Williamson dealt with the horror of organization by simply assuming it away , seeing large corporations merely as a way to reduce transaction costs among self-interested individuals . [ 277 ] As a result , with the exception of wartime , the role of the British state was limited to writing reports about how backward British business was and how that threatened national security . As Barnett wrote , “ To suggest in Britain in the late nineteenth century that the government should guide the industrial and commercial life of the nation was like suggesting medical treatment to a Jehovah ’ s Witness. ” [ 278 ] This was a doctrinal spell that was cast over the British leaders . Again , Barnett : “ Like an enchantment , liberal doctrine seemed to blind British eyes and paralysis British willpower. ” [ 279 ] This was , to say the least , a crisis of utmost proportions as Germany , Japan , and the United States were racing ahead , all three with at least some , if not strong , support from government . [ 280 ] Barnett continued , “ Thus after 1870 liberal economic doctrine itself was the most catastrophically inappropriate of all the outdated components of British economic development. ” [ 281 ] And as it became clearer and clearer on just how far Britain was falling behind , even as many continued to keep their head in the sands of denial ( as in the United States today ) , he wrote , “ No evidence of foreign success therefore shook the general British faith in British industry. ” [ 282 ] While the parallels of British history then are certainly not exact with the American situation today , there are striking similarities . Liberalism dominates U.S. political economy thinking , and with it the belief that no industry is more important than others , that trade is largely welfare-maximizing , and that state policy is not needed , other than in the form of limited regulations and taxes and perhaps science spending and immigration , to ensure national power industry capabilities . To use Smith ’ s terms , it is time to give more priority to “ power ” and less to “ opulence. ” There are two key problems with this conceptualization that consumer and investor welfare is synonymous with national welfare . First , this might be true , or at least truer , if we were talking about net-present value welfare . But all too often stock prices go up when companies take steps that weaken their long-term position but strengthen their quarterly or yearly financials . When CEO Mark Hurd was cutting Hewlett Packard ’ s long-term investments , including in R & D , he helped drive HP stock prices through the roof . Yet , the real net present value of the firm was declining , as was made clear when this “ rob the future to pay the present ” strategy was made clear to shareholders . Second , even consumer-welfare economists recognize the existence of externalities wherein the costs or benefits from an individual actor ’ s decision ( including a firm ) are not the same as the costs or benefits to society . But despite their incorporation of externalities in economic theory , for the most part , they ignore them , especially when advising on policy . Their view is that externalities are too messy , too uncertain , and too open to manipulation by politics . Let ’ s pretend they don ’ t exist , and that market forces alone produce optimality . But , by definition , national power is an externality . From a consumer-welfare perspective , defense spending is a complete waste—as are , for the conventional economists , national power industry policies . But clearly defending the nation from aggression is an important benefit , even if individual consumers or firms taxed to pay for it don ’ t benefit . At the end of the day , national power industries have much in common with pure defense industries , and their strength provides important national benefits . It is inappropriate to blame conventional economists for the paucity of their theory and concepts . Consumer welfare economics is what it is , and it certainly has its uses . But its uses are close to zero when it comes to shaping and guiding national industry power strategy . Where mainstream economists deserve blame is veering from their lane to negatively pontificate against a national power industry strategy . They should stick to their knitting : issues such as interest rates , the problems with housing price controls , and the like . Leave national power industry strategy to the experts . Consumer welfare economics is what it is , and it certainly has its uses . But its uses are close to zero when it comes to shaping and guiding national industry power strategy . This means that conventional economics as practiced in the United States and Commonwealth nations , and to somewhat lesser extent in Europe , can no longer by the lodestar guide shaping national economic policy . It was not designed to operate in a national power trade world , and it was not designed to generate national power industry strength . As such , it is now fundamentally harmful to the nation , and if it continues to be the policy bible , it will lead to the decline of the United States . The reality of this techno-economic and trade attack fundamentally undercuts the foundation of consumer welfare economics , and exposes its inability to address the current challenge . If national power , not consumer welfare , is the ultimate goal , this doctrine fails , at least for guiding the share of the economy composed of national economic power industries . If a nation ’ s industrial mix is critical , then this doctrine of “ potato chips , computer chips , what ’ s the difference ? ” fails . While there has been growing criticism of consumer welfare economics—what its critics call “ neoliberalism ” —the replacement that most on the Left have adopted is no better in dealing with the China threat ; in fact , it is likely worse . A broad-strokes consensus has gelled around the contours of a neo-New Deal economic agenda marked by redistribution , global economic autarky , and worker-centric animus toward large corporations and markets . If implemented , neo-New Dealism might generate a one-time reduction in inequality , but it would come at the longer-term cost of economic stagnation , fiscal crisis , and greatly diminished U.S. national power industry capabilities . In its worst form , neo-New Dealism would severely erode the meritocratic , individualist capitalist system as America has known it . Progressive journalist Michael Tomasky perhaps defined neo-New Dealism best . He calls it “ middle-out economics ” which “ is the belief that prosperity comes from a thriving middle class , and therefore government plays a role in supporting families and communities . This version of capitalism—more just , more equal , and in which prosperity is shared—could be the American future. ” [ 283 ] Many of those who have turned toward neo-New Dealism hold a deep skepticism toward corporations , markets , and American global power . Proponents of neo-New Dealism , a faction that now includes much more than just the Bernie Sanders and “ Squad ” wing of the Democratic Party , insist that they are just providing a needed alternative to neoliberalism , filling a gap that needed filling . But with its animus toward large companies ; its deep suspicion of markets , globalization , and capitalism ; its focus on short-term worker welfare ; and its overriding goal of redistributing rather than growing the pie , neo-New Dealism would mean losing the national power industry war with China . Sadly , some Republicans have begun to embrace some of these progressive views , especially the animus toward large corporations , the focus on redistribution , and their putting worker interests ahead of national interests , especially related to automation and technology . Neo-New Dealism is about redistribution that ignores , and often rejects , growth ( e.g. , it ’ s bad for the planet , it only helps the rich get richer , it creates too much disruption , etc. ) . Its “ middle out ” agenda—including eliminating college debt ; free health care , elder care , college tuition , and childcare ; weakened IP protection ; drug price controls ; mandates on companies , such as forcing Internet service providers ( ISPs ) to sell broadband at a loss ; breaking up big companies and limiting productivity-enhancing mergers ; subsidizing more expensive clean energy ; and even a universal basic income more is a way to divide a fixed pie , not grow it . Its proposed massive spending on social policy goals and redistribution would leave little to invest in national power industries . To be fair , neo-New Dealers are not averse to “ industrial policy. ” But most of their “ investments ” would be to advance their “ green equity ” agenda of clean energy , human service industries such as childcare and eldercare , subsidized housing , and mass transit . In a report for the Brookings Institution , Harvard professor Dani Rodrik has advocated for “ good jobs , ” including more jobs in nursing homes . [ 284 ] And of course , its anticorporate , neo-Brandeisian antitrust agenda would mean constant attacks on large corporations doing battle with CCP-backed national champions . And its pro-worker fixation would mean an anti-automation agenda , something that is critical to not losing to China that has the opposite effect : automation full steam ahead . Sadly , some Republicans have begun to embrace some of these progressive views , especially the animus toward large corporations , the focus on redistribution ( in this case , to working-class families rather than on race , as the Democrats focus more on ) , and their putting worker interests ahead of national interests , especially related to automation and technology . [ 285 ] Emulating the progressives ’ neo-New Dealism “ middle-out ” framing , Oren Cass , the founder and president of American Compass , a conservative reform organization , has written : This response emerges from an insight that I like to call the working hypothesis : that a labor market in which workers can support strong families and communities is the central determinant of long-term prosperity and should be the central focus of public policy . Genuine prosperity depends upon people working as productive contributors to their society , through which they can achieve self-sufficiency , support their families , participate in their communities , and raise children prepared to do the same . [ 286 ] The reality of the CCP ’ s techno-economic and trade war on the West undercuts the foundations of neo-New Deal progressivism . If the United States is in an existential contest for global power , then boosting taxing and regulations on business is especially ill-advised , as is the neo-Brandeisian campaign to destroy large corporations . As are unrestrained demands from organized labor . Progressive advocates know this quite well , which is why they go to any end to deny that China even is a competitor . [ 287 ] The grand strategy of stand and fight , ideally with the support of U.S. allies who hopefully don ’ t cave and strike their own separate Quisling deals , requires a coherent national power industry strategy . Free-market policy , and even a manufacturing policy , competitiveness policy , and innovation policy—none will get the United States where it needs to be , because , by definition , they are all agnostic to strategic industry capabilities . The problem is that Washington has virtually no experience with a national power industry strategy . There is neither the conceptual framework for how to craft a strategy , the institutional and legal frameworks to enact it , nor the skills in the federal workforce to manage it . The last time Washington tried do something like this was in WWII when the Roosevelt administration , under the leadership of “ Big Bill ” Knudsen and Henry Kaiser , organized industry into the arsenal of democracy . [ 288 ] Knudsen , then the CEO of General Motors , was put in charge of the Office of Production Management . His task was not to spur innovation or even generate more manufacturing , but rather to help American industry transition to build mass amounts of weapons to defeat our enemies . Kaiser , CEO of Kaiser Steel , was tasked with building a flotilla of “ liberty ships. ” At the same time , the Office of Scientific Research and Development was created to drive scientific and engineering research for military purposes . [ 289 ] That task , while daunting , was in many ways easier and more straightforward than today ’ s . The United States already had the world ’ s largest and most technologically sophisticated manufacturing sector . And the transition from trucks to tanks and passenger planes to bomber planes was not as complicated as it would be today , given the advanced technology involved in today ’ s weapons systems . And the focus was somewhat narrow : produce a massive amount of a relatively small variety of weapons . Today ’ s task is much harder . The United States has already lost significant manufacturing capabilities , and its “ industrial commons ” is hollower than it should be . And the focus must be much broader than just weapons systems , to include dual-use industries . That suggests that any effort needs to be guided by strategic analysis , not just throwing a jumble of disconnected policies and programs at the problem . The problem is that Washington has virtually no experience with a national power industry strategy . There is neither the conceptual framework for how to craft a strategy , the institutional and legal frameworks to enact it , nor the skills in the federal workforce to manage it . Where to start ? Fortunately , the concept and theory of strategy have been formulated in business . Business schools have long had courses in strategy , and the number of books and articles published on the topic are legion . Business strategy is a much more valuable intellectual vein to mine compared with economics because , in contrast to the latter , which sees transactions as utility maximizing for both parties , business strategy sees competition as win-lose , exactly the dynamics between the United States and China . In addition , economics is largely based on theories , models , and equations and assumes that the real world fits the models—and when it doesn ’ t , economists complain about the world , not the models . And at the same time , the field of international affairs largely overlooks business competition , industry structure , and technology innovation . For both fields , the concept of technology is limited to things that are broadly familiar , such as AI and cybersecurity . Neither consider things such as catalysis , computer numerical control processes ( CNC ) , or combustion engineering . And both assume , as Robert Solow did , that technology emerges out of nowhere , like manna from heaven . So , they don ’ t even contemplate the possibility of defeat . Rather , they assume there might be shocks that harm some blue collar workers , which is to be lamented and addressed with career training and free bus tickets to help them move out of their loser communities to the coasts , where they can aspire to become two-earner professional couples in more lucrative service industries . Business strategy can ’ t afford this luxury . It has to be based on ground truth reality , or as close as strategists can get to , because the costs of being wrong are usually obvious , immediate , and painful . A business strategy consultant , or a firm implementing business strategy that has the wrong strategic formulation , will soon be out of business . In contrast , economists are seldom if ever punished for being wrong . Just think that , in 2007 , most economists , including Alan Greenspan , Ben Bernanke , and economists at the NY and Boston Fed and International Monetary Fund , said a nationwide housing price collapse was virtually impossible . It is hard to think of a single one that suffered professionally from this flawed ideologically based advice . Finally , good business strategy is based on a deep understanding of competitors , one ’ s own organizational capabilities , and threats and opportunities in the current and emergent environment . This kind of thinking is completely absent in economics , but it is central to national power industry competition . As such , it ’ s worth reviewing corporate strategy literature and then discussing how it can be applied to national power industry strategy . The godfather of corporate strategy , Harvard Business School ’ s Michael Porter , wrote : The essence of strategy formulation is coping with competition ... Whatever their collective strength , the corporate strategists ’ goal is to find position in the industry where his or her company can best defend itself against those forces or can influence them in its favor… Rivalry among existing competitors takes the familiar form of jockeying for position , product introduction , and advertising slugfests . [ 290 ] He went on to note , “ Once the corporate strategist has assessed the forces affecting competition in his industry and their underlying causes , he can identify his company ’ s strengths and weaknesses. ” [ 291 ] Strategy is always in the service of goals . And organizations and nations can have strategies or not . But what often passes for strategy in government is policy . Policy for nations is an amalgam of different government actions ( e.g. , different tax provisions , spending on a particular area , a specific regulation ) . If these are oriented toward a common goal , they can be described as a comprehensive policy for “ x ” ( climate , innovation , equity , etc. ) . But policy is not strategy . Strategy is the use of policies to achieve particular outcomes that take into account the overall internal and external environment . What should be the goal of national economic strategy ? That is the single most important question and the one that must be answered first and gotten right . Organizations have an easier time agreeing on a goal . For most companies , the goal is maximizing profits—ideally net present value profits . Not only do nations seek to achieve many goals , but also the process of deciding on these goals , at least in democracies , is messy to say the least . When it comes to economic goals , for the last half century or so , the United States has not been able to come close to agreeing on an overarching one . Some on the Right put freedom from government as the paramount goal , with the belief that this will solve any and all economic problems . But as noted previously , there is no logical reason why a laissez-faire policy would lead to a strong competitive position in national power industries that the United States must be strong at to compete with China . Free-market advocates either deny that the U.S. needs industrial capabilities in key industries or simply assert that this is the role for defense spending . Policy is not strategy . Strategy is the use of policies to achieve particular outcomes that take into account the overall internal and external environment . The problem with the latter approach is twofold . First , defense capabilities increasingly rely on commercial capabilities , and what use to be mostly spin-off ( defense innovations being used by the commercial sector ) are now more spin-on ( commercial innovations being used by defense ) . [ 292 ] This is one reason for the creation of organizations such as In-Qtel , the Defense Innovation Unit , and DOD ’ s Office of Strategic Capital . Second , even if DOD could create its own self-sufficient and technologically advanced ecosystem , with rest of the economy being law firms , personal service firms , and retail , the costs would be enormous . For example , commercial semiconductor manufacturing relies on mass production to achieve economies of scale and drive down costs . A defense-only model would forego these benefits , leading to vastly higher prices per chip . Moreover , with no commercial partner to share the cost , DOD would have to bear the full expense of developing custom technologies for its unique security , performance , and radiation-hardening needs . While the free-market hold on Washington thinking has lessened in the last decade especially , it ’ s possible that replacement doctrines , while better , all suffer from systematic limitations for being guides to a national power industry strategy . This is true even for the new manufacturing reshoring doctrine , that many on the Right and the Left have embraced . In this doctrine , restoring manufacturing is the overarching economic goal . In this narrative , the goal should be to restore the working class to its prior position and advocates to see the way to do this by boosting manufacturing , regardless of sector . But even if the United States grew manufacturing so much that it eliminated its manufacturing trade deficit , the number of blue-collar jobs that would be created would be modest at best , less than 2 percent of the U.S. workforce . [ 293 ] And like the free-market doctrine , there is no logical reason why a manufacturing doctrine would lead to a strong competitive position in the national power industries the United States must be strong in to not lose to China . It might very well grow consumer sectors such as furniture and plastics , but not power sectors such as aerospace and biotech . The same problems exist with those that embrace the competitiveness and innovation policy doctrines . These doctrines rightly want government to do more to spur competitiveness , especially of advanced sectors and technological innovation broadly . And certainly , more of both would be better and would contribute to boosting U.S. power . But again , there is no reason why generic competitiveness and innovation strategies ( e.g. , more STEM immigration , a stronger R & D tax credit , more federal support for science ) would necessarily preserve critically needed national power industries . The same is true for the new fashionable “ Abundance ” and “ Progress ” movements . [ 294 ] These movements rightly argue that America needs to once again embrace progress and risk taking , and that we need to significantly reduce the barriers to building things . They want to “ shape the progress movement into a cultural force. ” [ 295 ] But while certainly useful and needed , to think that fewer regulations , a bit more policy risk taking , and more general optimism of the future is enough to not lose the national power industry war is to not understand the nature of the challenge . [ 296 ] Competitiveness policy is indifferent to particular industries and therefore there is no need to conduct strategic industry strategy . Finally , there are those who are indifferent to industrial development and have an anticapitalist , neo-New Deal doctrine . The Democratic Left is increasingly focused on economic , social , and demographic equity and the fight against the privileged classes . To the extent it has an industrial strategy , it is for human services industries such as day care and elder care . In addition , much of the Left ’ s support for industrial policy is actually climate policy , such as supporting the Inflation Reduction Act to spur the building of factories producing renewable energy technologies . But for the most part , with the exception of motor vehicles , these sectors are not strategic in relation to China . For example , if China cut off exports of solar panels , the effect would not be felt immediately and other electricity generation technologies , such as natural gas turbines , could be used . That leaves national power industry strategy . [ 297 ] It is a subset of competitiveness policy , but differs in one critical way . Competitiveness policy is indifferent to particular industries and therefore there is no need to conduct strategic industry strategy . But before delving into national power industry strategy , it ’ s worth examining competitiveness strategy and its limitations . Figure 6 : Relationship between competitiveness strategy and national power industry strategy It would seem that competitiveness policy should be the replacement doctrine to neoclassical consumer welfare-focused economics . But while it is closer to the solution we need than consumer-welfare economics or neo-New Deal economics is , it can not be the guide for the simple reason that it does not prioritize defending key industries . Competitiveness policy is much broader , relating to a more robust competitive trade position for U.S. companies—like how manufacturing policy is indifferent to strategic sectors , competitiveness policy is even more indifferent , as it is agnostic whether the United States is competitive in goods or services . When it comes to national competitiveness strategy the bible remains Michael Porter ’ s The Competitive Advantage of Nations , published in 1990 . The book was a major contribution to the debate at the time , and it remains highly influential for how competitiveness experts and politicians think about the issue . Because of that , it is worth examining what Porter got right and what he got wrong , especially for today ’ s China era . Porter got much right . First , he rightly pointed out that national prosperity is created , not inherited , a direct challenge to much of international trade theory at the time , which still believed in comparative , rather than competitive advantage . Second , Porter pointed out that competitive advantage is something governments should strive for—yet is something most U.S. economists still question . Third , he stressed the importance of innovation in creating competitive advantage . Fourth , he built theories of competitive advantage up from the experience of industries , not down from broad macro conditions . This is critical because almost all that passes for competitiveness or industrial policy today ignores industry analytics . As Porter wrote , “ The particular industry—passenger cars , facsimile machines , accounting services , ball bearings—is where competitive advantage of firms is either won or lost. ” [ 298 ] He went on to note that “ firms play a central role in the process of creating competitive advantage. ” [ 299 ] This is why he wrote that his theory drew on several fields , including of course the business literature of competitive strategy , but also fields of “ technological innovation , industrial economics , economic development , economic geography , international trade , political science , and industrial sociology. ” [ 300 ] Note that he did not include macro- and micro-economics , the disciplines that dominate economic policy thinking in the United States . The fields Porter drew from are largely ignored in Washington in favor a sterile and model-based abstract economics . Fifth , he brought in the critical field of strategy , writing that “ a new theory must reflect a rich conception of competition that includes segmented markets , differentiated products , technological differences and economies of scale … and process innovation. ” [ 301 ] Despite Porter ’ s contribution , these insights have had virtually no impact in Washington , where sectoral level analysis and strategy largely do not exist and where macro-economists and finance experts run economic policy . Sixth , Porter demonstrated the importance of dynamic , not static , competition—something that today ’ s economic theory , including antitrust , too often misses . As he wrote , “ In actual competition , the essential character is innovation and change . Instead of being limited to passively shifting resources to where the returns are the greatest , the real issue is how firms increase the returns available through new products and processes. ” [ 302 ] Seventh , he recognized a role for government , something most economists deny or minimize . But as discussed ahead , Porter significantly underestimated that role , as almost all corporate strategists still do . Much of what Porter wrote represents an important contribution to the understanding of national competitiveness . But Porter ’ s thinking , and the thinking of other experts and organizations who have adopted the conventional Porter-inspired competitiveness framework , contains fatal flaws that make policy recommendations stemming from it be inadequate at best , and harmful at worst . His cardinal intellectual sin was that he wrongly argued that “ the only meaningful concept of competitiveness at the national level is national productivity. ” [ 303 ] At one level , it ’ s surprising that someone of his stature could make such a fundamental error of logic as this , but few scholars can escape their intellectual background when delving into adjacent fields , and his background was in how firms boost their profits ( e.g. , productivity ) . Others have followed his framing . WEF ’ s Global Competitiveness Report defines competitiveness as “ the set of institutions , policies , and factors that determine the level of productivity of a country. ” [ 304 ] And IMD ’ s World Competitiveness Yearbook defines competitiveness similarly , but more broadly , as how an “ economy manages the totality of its resources and competencies to increase the prosperity of its population. ” [ 305 ] But while these two terms are related , competitiveness should not be equated with productivity or GDP growth . To see why , it ’ s important to differentiate between traded and nontraded industries . A traded industry is one in which the firms sell a significant share of their output outside a particular geographical area . For example , a printing firm in Michigan that sells printed material to customers across the United States would be a traded firm from the perspective of the Michigan economy , but a nontraded firm from the perspective of the U.S. economy . In contrast , a software firm in Washington that sells software throughout the world would be a traded firm from the state and national perspective . Porter ’ s thinking contains fatal flaws that make policy recommendations stemming from it be inadequate at best , and harmful at worst . Thus , competitiveness relates only to the economic health of a region ’ s or nation ’ s traded sectors . ( For the purpose of this memo , the term “ region ” shall refer to both national and subnational economies ) But how do we define health ? One definition is jobs . But this can ’ t be right , because if one region ’ s traded sector is highly productive , it will have fewer jobs than another region ’ s traded sector that is less productive , yet it may be more competitive . Another definition is value added—the amount of value that traded sector firms add to the inputs of production that they purchase . This is closer to the right definition , but it fails to control for the extent to which a region ’ s economy is traded . One region ’ s economy might be more traded than another ’ s and therefore its traded sector is larger , but it might have vastly more imports , meaning that its traded sector is not holding its own when it comes to competitiveness . But even this is not quite precise enough , for one region might run a trade surplus but do so by subsidizing its exporters ( e.g. , by manipulating its currency ) or erecting barriers to importers ( e.g. , tariffs ) . In this case , the trade surplus may not be a reflection of the true competitiveness of the region ’ s traded sector firms , but rather a reflection of the extent of mercantilist aid the traded sector firms receive . This sets up the true definition : competitiveness is the ability of an economy to export more in value-added terms than it imports , while accounting for the “ terms of trade ” to reflect all government “ discounts ” ( including an artificially low currency , suppressed wages in export sectors , artificially low taxes on traded sector firms , and direct subsidies to exports ) , as well as foreign barriers to its exports ( both tariff and nontariff ) . Under this definition , a nation may run a large trade surplus ( one component of competitiveness ) , but if it does so by providing large “ discounts ” to its exporters or by blocking imports , it would not be truly competitive , for such policies would reduce its terms of trade by requiring its residents to give up some of their income to foreign consumers , pay higher prices for foreign goods and services , or both . We can see this by looking at past trends in the U.S. trade deficit . When the rise in the relative price of imports brought about through the lower value of the dollar in the last half of the 1980s helped reduce the U.S. trade deficit , it also reduced the U.S. terms of trade ( the United States could buy fewer imports for the same quantity of exports ) . Therefore , U.S. competitiveness was unchanged even as the trade deficit declined . Likewise , the fact that the United States runs a massive trade deficit today but many of its trading partners run surpluses by means of massive “ discounting ” ( including currency manipulation ) and import blocking means that we can not determine with certainty that the U.S. economy is uncompetitive . In fact , despite numerous studies claiming to compare national competitiveness , no study to date has actually done this because none has fully accounted for the magnitude of export discounting and import blocking , in part because the data is extremely difficult to collect . While data exists on trade balances for virtually all nations , data on the extent of export discounts and import blocking ( especially through nontariff barriers ) is difficult to obtain . Despite this , at a cursory level , it would appear that nations such as Austria , Germany , and Sweden would be on a list of competitive economies ( they run trade surpluses while also having relatively high wages and limited other discounts ) . In contrast , nations such as China ( too much discounting ) and the United States ( too large a trade deficit even when accounting for foreign subsidies ) would likely not make the list of competitive economies . How does productivity fit into competitiveness ? Productivity can enable competitiveness , especially if it is concentrated in traded sectors , which lowers costs and enables firms to sell more in global markets without relying on government-provided discounts . But productivity growth can also be relatively unrelated to competitiveness if it is concentrated in nontraded sectors . Imagine a nation with strong productivity growth but almost all of it in nontraded sectors such as grocery stores , electric utilities , and nursing homes . Certainly , incomes would go up as relative prices in these sectors fell , but firms in traded sectors would only see modest reductions in their costs based on the extent of purchased inputs from nontraded firms . The United States could very well be much stronger internationally with no trade deficit and no diminution of the value of the dollar and still see key industries beaten and destroyed by China . Porter recognized that “ to firms , competitiveness meant the ability to compete in world markets. ” [ 306 ] Although he should have added the caveat that this only matters for firms in traded industries , not domestic serving industries . But he can ’ t go to the next logical step of saying that to nations , competitiveness meant the ability to compete in world markets . Presumably , this is because he worried that it would empower protectionists who cared about deindustrialization . But in fact , countries do compete , as we will see ahead regarding China . But even this true definition of competitiveness still does not address the core existential challenge facing the United States : predation by China for strategic industries . The United States could very well be much stronger internationally with no trade deficit and no diminution of the value of the dollar and still see key industries beaten and destroyed by China . It could boost exports in tourism , banking , consulting , higher education , natural resources , food products , plastics , and furniture but lose is aerospace , machinery , biotech , semiconductors , and other advanced industries to China . Before discussing the concept and importance of strategic national power industries , it ’ s important to consider the other major problems in Porter ’ s work , because so many people continue to rely on the Porter framework even though it no longer applies to the world the United States finds itself in today . A Focus on Democratic Nations : First , Porter analyzed democratic , capitalist nations ; not China . As such , he made two key assumptions . One was that other countries would generally play by the rules . And two was that it was okay if U.S. firms disinvested in certain industries . It didn ’ t matter if other nations won in certain industries , as long as the United States ’ firms generally invested in areas they had competitive advantage in . In fact , Porter did not even mention China in his book . The assumptions he made about the competitive environment of firms in the United States or any of the countries he advised simply do not hold when it comes to China . Porter was writing about capitalism , not state capitalism . And state capitalism changes everything . Among other items , he assumed that 1 ) foreign firms would not engage in systematic dumping ; 2 ) nations would not be able to afford massive subsidies to targeted industries ; 3 ) to the extent they did dump or subsidize , national trade policies would effectively respond to such policies ; and 4 ) foreign markets would generally be open to imports , and if they were not , negotiations would pry them open . Of course , none of that applies to Chinese state capitalism . Porter went on to claim that “ subsidies of any kind will have little leverage when competition is based on quality , rapid product development , and advanced features. ” [ 307 ] But what about when the competitor has pretty good quality , fairly rapid product development , and many advanced features but on top of that has massive subsidies from the government ? This describes many Chinese firms . Then those subsidies provide massive leverage . Moreover , in many markets , particularly middle-income countries , price matters more and buyers are willing to buy Chinese goods that are not quite as good as American because of the strong price advantage . Porter ignores this because he couldn ’ t conceive of what China became and didn ’ t anticipate the strong growth of global GDP in developing markets . Porter was writing about capitalism , not state capitalism . And state capitalism changes everything . To the extent Porter envisioned tough price competition , his advice was that firms downsize and even exit , because competing on price is a fool ’ s errand . And he applied this advice to governments to give up on industries that they couldn ’ t easily compete in because of price , even if most of the price differential was due to unfair government practices . Porter also wrote that companies , and nations by extension , should give short shrift to unfair foreign trade practices . For Porter , this just opened up rent seeking that ultimately kept firms from evolving . In fact , he noted unfair trade practices with italics ( “ unfair ” ) to suggest that they really are not unfair . He argued that firms and governments pushing pack against foreign unfair trade practices “ postpone change , dampen innovation … and work in exactly the wrong direction from those necessary for competitive advantage. ” [ 308 ] This is clearly wrong . If it ’ s true , why not encourage other nations to ramp up unfair advantages , as doing so would really motivate U.S. firms to compete . But if the unfairness is actually a Colt 45 to the head , as it is with China , it won ’ t motivate , it will decimate . Porter also applied the same corollary to domestic policy , when he wrote , “ Direct government ‘ assistance ’ [ again note the quotation marks to imply that it is not actually assisting ] in one firm or industry also has a strong tendency to create forces that cause it to spread and multiply. ” [ 309 ] He was writing as if assistance were highly contagious and a deadly communicable disease and not a key factor to respond to Chinese power industry predation . Related to this , and reflecting his firm orientation , Porter repeatedly rejected the idea that nations should seek to address systematic cost disadvantages , in fact , bizarrely saying that these are good , as they spur firms to compete and innovate more . Perhaps , but not when the cost differentials are large and persistent as they are vis-à-vis the United States and China . Perhaps betraying his lack of understanding of international economics Porter did not appear to ever consider that currency is the natural market adjustment mechanism in international trade except that it doesn ’ t work for the United States because the dollar is the reserve currency . A Limited Role for Government : Second , Porter only saw a limited role for government in boosting firm or industry competitiveness . The role of government “ is inevitably partial. ” [ 310 ] When a nation ’ s companies are competing against companies from other nations that generally play by the rules , perhaps this framing is correct . Although Porter largely ignored the key role the USG played in the development of many industries , including shipbuilding , aerospace , semiconductors , and interchangeable parts . But again , in a world where China practices techno-economic predation , such a limited role is by definition a death sentence for domestic industry that China targets . He applied his famous Porter diamond of five forces that affect firm competitiveness to national policy . These were threat of new entrants , bargaining power of suppliers , bargaining power of buyers , threat of substitute products or services , and in the middle , rivalry among existing competitors . For countries , he listed four : national factor conditions , firm strategy , structure and rivalry , related and supporting industries , and demand conditions . But this reflects his overarching ideology of limited government , a blind spot most business strategists suffer from . Sure , government can build some roads and fund some R & D and put in place some regulations . But under no circumstances should it be involved in industry strategy . Porter ’ s theory allowed firm exit from markets , and in fact actively supported it . But countries can not allow power industry exit unless they want less power . He made assumptions that at least in the case of China are not true as when he said that “ even when staffed with the most elite civil servants , governments make erratic decisions about the industry to develop , the technologies to invest in , and the competitive advantages that will be the most appropriate and achievable. ” [ 311 ] Yet , he assumed that leaving these choices to a nation ’ s firms would maximize competitiveness : which Porter meant as productivity . Porter opposed governments targeting particular industries because “ targeting distorts market signals by altering the incentives of private firms to compete in an industry. ” [ 312 ] He wrote that when government distorts market signals , especially through direct targeting , it can not rely on firms to invest only in fundamentally sound industries . It places the burden on government planners to understand the subtle conditions for national advantage. ” [ 313 ] He went on to complain that “ one nation after another crowds into the same industries , ” creating overcapacity . [ 314 ] Perhaps in a pre-China world this might have some basis , but not now . When China targets U.S. firms with attacks , fundamentally distorting market forces , not responding distorts market forces . Nations Can Choose Any Industry : Porter ’ s third error was that he treated industry choice the way companies treated it . Profit-making companies are indifferent about the industry they are in , as long as they maximize profits . So should nations be , said Porter , writing , “ Manufacturing is not ‘ better ’ than services … because many services involve sophisticated technology and high levels of productivity. ” [ 315 ] If the goal is productivity , Porter was correct . Whatever set of industries maximize productivity are the best ones . But if the goal is competitiveness , and in particular power industry competitiveness , then nations can not be indifferent about which industries they are strong in . Porter ’ s theory allowed firm exit from markets , and in fact actively supported it . But countries can not allow power industry exit unless they want less power . Cost Competition Is Not Key : Fourth , Porter rejected cost competition . Like almost all strategy gurus , he advised firms to not engage in slugging it out in price competition because doing so eroded margins . Better to find ways to move up the value chain or seek niches that maintain margins . If that doesn ’ t work , then shrink . But that clearly can not be the answer for strategic industries . The United States does not have the luxury of getting out of industries such as semiconductors and aerospace even if China attacks the margins . He wrote that a “ 10 percent cost saving through economies of scale … is nullified quickly by rapid product and process improvement. ” [ 316 ] But in a hyper-competitive environment with China , where it will have the former and the latter , not pursuing the former is a recipe for market share loss . Porter ’ s third error was that he treated industry choice the way companies treated it . Profit-making companies are indifferent about the industry they are in , as long as they maximize profits . So should nations be . Top-Line Growth Is Key : Fifth , Porter reflected the common view in the business strategy literature that the best strategy is to go for top-line growth in new markets , rather than slugging it out with other firms in existing markets . He wrote , “ The most sustainable strategies are those that widen and upgrade the market rather than simply taking business away from foreign firms. ” [ 317 ] That might be a good strategy for firms that have no fundamental responsibility for maintaining production of power goods . But it is a defeating strategy for nations . Firms Must Choose Between Cost and Differentiation : His sixth error was in assuming that firms had a fundamental choice in industry positioning between lower cost and differentiation . This was common business strategy advice at the time . As David Moshella argued : In 1995 , Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema argued that companies could excel in one of three areas— product leadership ( PL ) , operational efficiency ( OE ) , or customer intimacy ( CI ) 7 . Strategically , they needed to choose which discipline to focus on , and then be competitive in the other two . This thinking made great sense in the pre-digital age—with Sony ( PL ) , McDonald ’ s ( OE ) , and the Ritz-Carlton ( CI ) serving as iconic examples of each approach . But the digital leaders shown in the figure typically excel in all three dimensions . For example , Amazon and Netflix have the widest product selection , the most efficient operations , and the most personalized customer experience in their respective markets . [ 318 ] That was certainly true when he wrote the book Seeing Digital : A Visual Guide to the Industries , Organizations , and Careers of the 2020s . [ 319 ] But the emergence of digital technologies has made that much less true . Digital-first companies can now achieve low costs , high quality , and differentiation . That means the safety niche of moving upscale to differentiation is less safe from attack . One key aspect of Porter ’ s work ( and others in the field ) is the idea of bad competitors . For anyone who plays poker , a bad player is someone who is so bad they don ’ t know when the opponent is making a great bluff and hence stay in and win . In the case of bad competitors , Porter argues they have several characteristics . First , they are aggressive price cutters even if doing so hurts their long-term profitability and overall industry profitability . Second , they are low-differentiation players that offer similar products with little or no differentiation , making it difficult for any firm to establish a sustainable competitive advantage . Third , they are unstable participants that enter an industry with aggressive tactics and limited resources , potentially destabilizing the market . And finally , they are high-stakes competitors that are heavily invested in an industry and will fight aggressively to maintain their position , even during downturns . These factors largely describe Chinese competitors that , for the most part , are bad competitors employing almost militaristic , scorched-earth policies . They aggressively cut prices , not worrying about year after year of losses , usually backed up by Chinese government deep pockets . This China price—aggressive pricing—destroys gross margins industry-wide . Second , they specialize in copycat products . Third , they aggressively enter new industries such as biotech , aerospace , and high-speed rail where they have little experience and ultimately completely destabilizing markets , in part because they end up closing their own markets to competition . And finally , they don ’ t blink in either economy- or industry-wide downturns ; they keep investing and expanding , leading to global overcapacity . U.S. and allied nations must prepare for a decades-long siege wherein a share of national income will have to be devoted to shoring up power industries in order to endure grueling trench warfare . When it comes to dealing with such competitors in normal countries , Porter proposed three possible strategies . First , abandon the industry . If the industry is structurally unattractive due to bad competitors and offers limited profit potential , a company might choose to exit the market and pursue opportunities elsewhere . Or it might abandon the United States and seek to match the artificial China price by moving production to China , or more recently , to even lower-cost locations such as India . Or it might go “ asset-light ” and outsource capital-intensive , lower-margin shares of the business to other companies , including companies outside the United States . In these situations , it makes little economic sense to invest , which is why so many companies return free cash to shareholders through stock buybacks . But this is temporary strategy at best . Moreover , both strategies hollow out domestic industrial capacity : strategy 1 directly reduces the manufacturing base , while Strategy 2 degrades supplier ecosystems and workforce capabilities . The result is a self-reinforcing cycle wherein American firms lose the ability to scale innovation and compete in advanced manufacturing , validating Andy Grove ’ s 2010 warning about the strategic risks of abandoning production competencies . [ 320 ] While this might be useful for the company in the short run , eventually , the company will have few places to run . And more importantly , abandonment is not a choice that countries seeking to maintain national techno-economic power can make . Second , convert bad competitors . Porter says that a c ompany might try to influence or educate bad competitors to adopt more sustainable competitive practices , such as focusing on differentiation or value-added services . Perhaps this might work with a normal company in a normal government , but it absolutely will not work with China . For at least two decades , U.S. policymakers thought that if they just engaged in enough dialogue , they could show the CCP the error of its ways and that it would start to compete fairly . Needless to say , that proved to be false . If neither of these two steps is possible , Porter advised preparing for a siege . In t his case , the company needs to adopt a long-term strategy focused on cost leadership or differentiation while enduring intense competition and potentially lower profits . That is what U.S. and allied nations must do : prepare for a decades-long siege wherein a share of national income will have to be devoted to shoring up power industries in order to endure grueling trench warfare . America needs a national power industry strategy . Conventional consumer-welfare economics won ’ t cut it , nor will progressive neo-New Dealism . Competitiveness , innovation , and manufacturing policy , while closer , all fall short of the mark . While there was considerable excellent work done on competitiveness policy , including by scholars such as John Zysman , Laura Tyson , Robert Hayes , Lester Thurow , Michael Piorre , James Womack , Annalee Saxenian , Ira Magaziner , and others in the 1980s and 1990s , that work did not have to focus on national power industries because our core competitors—particularly Japan and Germany—were allies . [ 321 ] Finally , new concepts such as the “ abundance movement , ” at best address only small parts of the challenge . For a national power industry strategy , the first issue is to identify which industries ( products in business strategy terms ) to compete for . And the second is development of an action plan based on an amalgam of deep industry analyses . What to do ? Unfortunately , in part because the United States has never faced this kind of challenge before , there is little intellectual work on which to build . As discussed , the closest is the field of business strategy . We need to look at this field , not for cookie cutter answers , but rather for inspiration and ideas that can be built upon to construct a national power industry strategy framework . What is business strategy ? It is not culture . It is not operational excellence . It is not planning and policy . Rather , strategy is about positioning and reacting . As strategy guru Roger Martin has written : Planning and strategy are two fundamentally different actions—and conflating them undermines performance . Planning is about allocating resources and setting out actions within a company ’ s control , like opening a new plant or hiring staff . Strategy , on the other hand , is about making a coherent set of choices that position an organization to win in a specific market . [ 322 ] One business strategy article argues that a business strategy has two core elements : The first is the product-market investment decision which includes the product-market scope of the business strategy , its investment intensity and the resource allocation in a multiple business context . The alternatives range from a withdrawal from a business area to a milking strategy to various growth strategies such as market share growth , or expansion of the product line or served market . The second core element is the development of a sustainable competitive advantage which encompasses underlying distinctive competences or assets , appropriate objectives , functional area policies , and the creation of synergy . A sustainable competitive advantage is usually based upon a strong point of differentiation such as product quality , a sustainable cost advantage , or a focus upon one or more market segments . [ 323 ] In other words , for a national power industry strategy , the first issue is to identify which industries ( products in business strategy terms ) to compete for . And the second is development of an action plan based on an amalgam of deep industry analyses . Business strategy is a much more effective source of information for a national power industry strategy than conventional dominant consumer welfare economics . First , unlike consumer welfare economics , which assumes in the Ricardian framework that trade is win-win , business strategy sees competition as mostly win-lose , with market share gains of one company coming at the expense of a competitor . And that is exactly what the U.S.-China techno-economic and trade relationship is . The PricewaterhouseCoopers journal Strategy and Business wrote : The concept of strategy originates in war , where the objective is to destroy the enemy . In business , if the enemy is your competitor , then the objective of strategy must be to crush the competition . Michael Porter gave academic standing to this way of thinking when he made popular the idea of “ competitive advantage ” with his best-selling textbook , Competitive Strategy , published in 1980 . [ 324 ] One leading strategy book from 1986 , Marketing Warfare , notes that it : applies military strategic principles to business competition , outlining four primary competitive strategies : defensive warfare ( for market leaders ) , offensive warfare ( for strong challengers ) , flanking attacks ( for smaller players finding undefended market segments ) , and guerrilla warfare ( for small companies using focused , limited attacks ) . [ 325 ] Second , unlike consumer welfare economics , which assumes that all industries are similar ( they all compete on demand and supply ) , business strategy also is grounded in recognition that industries ( and technologies ) are fundamentally different , and require different strategies . And that matters when competing with China because winning in biopharmaceuticals requires a very different kind of strategy than competing in quantum computing . Third , unlike consumer welfare economics , business strategy largely sees firm inputs as undifferentiated commodities firms can buy in markets . Business strategy recognizes the many different factors that go into a firm being able to win competitive challenges , including taxes . This is key because winning ( or at least not losing ) in various national power industries requires understanding that each requires unique inputs and policies . The concepts in business strategy are vastly richer than economics , wherein everything boils down to supply and demand , profit and loss , and allocation efficiency . Finally , unlike consumer welfare economics , which assumes that national economies tend toward a state of equilibrium , business strategy , especially work after the late 1990s , assumes a constant dynamic process . And also unlike consumer welfare economics , which assumes that innovation is constant , essentially “ manna from heaven , ” business strategy sees it as intentional . UC Berkely professor David Teece wrote : Dynamic capability is “ the firm ’ s ability to integrate , build , and reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments. ” Dynamic capabilities can be distinguished from operational or “ ordinary ” capabilities , which pertain to the current operations of an organization . Dynamic capabilities , by contrast , refer to “ the capacity of an organization to purposefully create , extend , or modify its resource base. ” [ 326 ] As one article notes , “ Competitive dynamics refer to a series of attacks and counterattacks launched by companies operating in a particular market to strengthen their competitive positions , where strategic actions by one firm often trigger reactions from rival firms. ” [ 327 ] The concepts in business strategy are vastly richer than economics , wherein everything boils down to supply and demand , profit and loss , and allocation efficiency . In other words , if you would have one discipline to shape national techno-economic and trade policy , economists or business scholars we would be better off with the latter . While certain sub-disciplines of economics such as industrial organization and regional economics address some of these concepts , by and large , consumer welfare economics glosses over them . These concepts include the following : ▪ Choices of technology leapfrogging ▪ Overcoming latecomer disadvantages ▪ Role of market share building ▪ Fixed costs and variable costs and impacts on marginal costs ▪ Economies of scope and scale ▪ Importance of execution vs. strategy ▪ Sources of competitive advantage ( price , quality , customization , innovation ) ▪ Incremental vs. disruptive innovation ▪ Organizational culture and resistance to disruptive innovation ▪ Turnaround strategies vs. sustaining ▪ Experience curve and learning curve [ 328 ] ▪ Growth-share matrix [ 329 ] ▪ Cost advantage vs. differentiation ▪ Barriers to entry ▪ Product life cycle and commodification ▪ Market growth rates ▪ Sustaining vs. disruptive innovation ▪ Industry positioning ▪ Market scope ( local , national , global ) ▪ Kinds of innovation ( product , process , business model ) ▪ Kinds of competition ( dynamic vs. static ) ▪ Industry externalities ▪ Network effects ▪ Agglomeration ( localization and urbanization ) ▪ First mover vs. latecomer advantages [ 330 ] ▪ Threat of entry and barriers to entry ▪ Expected retaliation from incumbent ▪ Substitutability ▪ Modularity These and other business strategy concepts can be incorporated into the shaping of a national power industry strategy and the multitude of sub-industry strategies that must be developed . While the business strategy frame offers a much more promising foundation to build on , there are important ways it does not fully translate for the establishment of a national power industry strategy . First , business strategy is based on indifference to strategic sectors . If Intel can make more money by becoming a fabless chip designer than it can competing with the likes of TSMC to produce chips , by all means it should do this . But that can not be an acceptable outcome from a power industry strategy because the nation needs leading chipmakers that are headquartered in the United States . Second , business strategy advises firms to not slug it out in markets based on cost competition . Pretty much every business strategy tells business executives to retreat to higher-margin parts of the business . This may or may not be good business advice , but it also might be bad in that it assumes that the cost challenger is consigned to cost competition , not other forms of higher-margin competition such as quality , customization , or brand . But either way , it is poor strategy for a nation seeking to not lose in cost competition because China always starts industry competition with a cost assault—and if U.S. firms fold and run at the first whiff of gunpowder , America will lose power industry capabilities . Besides , Chinese firms have shown that they always intend to move up the value chain and attack the high-margin segments . Going asset-light is usually counter to the goals of a national power industry strategy , which is based on boosting capital assets in country . Third , some of the business strategy literature , and most of the equity market advice , is for firms to maximize return on net assets . A key way to do boost this ratio is to reduce net assets . Companies do this by going asset-light and outsourcing more capital-intensive work to other companies that presumably don ’ t listen to business consultants . This way , capital can be freed up for other uses , such as stock buybacks . This may or may not be a good strategy to maximize long-term profitability and net-present value returns . But going asset-light is usually counter to the goals of a national power industry strategy , which is based on boosting capital assets in country . As one article notes , “ The tension is often between financial goals , such as cash flow and profit , and strategic goals , such as market position and growth. ” [ 331 ] For a corporation , the former dominate . For a country , the latter must dominate . Fourth , of course , is that the fundamental goals and operations of an economy are different than that of a firm , and the business strategy literature largely ignores the role of the state . It is instructive that chapter 12 of Porter ’ s book Competitive Advantage of Nations is not “ government strategy ” but “ government policy. ” This is key . The competitiveness community eschews strategy , but without it , we can ’ t solve for China strategic industry aggression . Box 5 : Shih-Paisano Industry Classification Model At the same time , calls for massive reshoring ignore the fact that it makes sense to rely on global supply chains for at least some manufacturing production . One useful framework for thinking about this comes from Harvard Business School professors Gary Pisano and Willy Shih . [ 332 ] They have argued that the degree to which it makes sense to offshore production or keep it at home depends on two factors : process maturity ( the extent to which the technologies used to produce a product are mature or continuing to evolve ) and modularity ( the degree to which information about product design can be separated from the manufacturing industry ) . Their argument is that in industries with high modularity and mature production processes , offshoring in order to lower costs makes good business sense and does not come at the cost of product or process innovation . They put the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients ( APIs ) in this category ; the production process is relatively mature and product innovation ( the development of new drugs ) is not dependent on close linkages to the production process . This is why a significant share of API production has moved offshore . In contrast , they ’ ve argued that biotechnology production ( the production of large-molecule , living compounds ) is not a mature production process and there are closer links between drug development and drug production . This is why a much larger share of biotechnology production is still in the United States . There are at least five main policy implications from this . The first is that , to the extent that policy can spur more drug innovation , especially in large-molecule , biotech drugs , it is more likely that production will be located in the United States . The converse is also true : the more there is a push to replace novel drugs with generics , the more likely that supply will be filled through offshore production . As Shih and Pisano wrote , in sectors developing breakthrough products at the frontiers of science , the major process innovations are evolving rapidly and are critical to product innovation . Later reports in this series will lay out in greater detail a national power industry strategy , including a comprehensive list of actionable policy steps America needs to take . For now , a broad framework follows . As in any conflict , there are two main tactics : strengthening one ’ s own forces and slowing the advance of the adversary ’ s forces or even degrading them . The former tactic requires a coherent national strategy to bolster domestic economic power . The latter requires steps to limit the PRC ’ s advances in national power industries . Both are required to succeed . The PRC ’ s subsidies and other weapons are so powerful that responding by simply boosting America ’ s domestic capabilities will not be enough , because for a variety of reasons the United States and core allies will never be able to do enough to counter PRC advantage . To slow Chinese gains , the United States and its core allies need to take actions in four areas : 1 ) limiting Chinese knowledge acquisition ; 2 ) limiting Chinese imports and investment in U.S. and key allied markets ; 3 ) reducing allied firms ’ production in China ; and 4 ) contesting Chinese firms in non-allied markets . Doing all of this will require a host of detailed legislative actions , plus administrative follow-up and enforcement . The PRC ’ s subsidies and other weapons are so powerful that responding by simply boosting America ’ s domestic capabilities will not be enough . Meanwhile , spurring U.S. and allied gains also will require action in four main areas . First , allied nations need to invest much more in the foundations of technology-based competitiveness , including R & D and skills development in science , technology , and engineering . And these initiatives will need to be structured and targeted in new ways for national power industries , working closely with industry leaders and experts . At the same time , a wide range of federal policies and programs need to be scrapped or modernized for the new era—especially environmental regulations , immigration policy , antitrust policy , tax policy , and economic policies pertaining to small businesses and industrial support . Second , it ’ s time to jettison the entire idea of free trade agreements . The very concept is based on the quasi-utopian idea that all nations are allies and inherently free traders . Alas , the last 15 years have proved that vision is deficient . Rather than free trade agreements , the United States needs to take the lead in forming strategic national power industry partnerships with allies that are willing to stand up against the CCP ’ s techno-economic aggression . These partnerships would require not only eliminating virtually all trade and investment barriers , but also requiring that each nation commits to limiting Chinese investment in their domestic markets , adopts a robust export-control and outward bound investment-review regime when it comes to China , agrees to share commercial counterintelligence , and engages in close techno-industrial partnerships . The U.S. government needs to craft industry-specific strategies as part of an overarching national power industry strategy . Third , as American capitalism and corporate financing have evolved into a finance-driven system that presses companies to be asset-light and to prioritize short-term returns , U.S. firms ’ ability to robustly fight this techno-economic war has declined . They are competing with Chinese firms that are willing to accept zero or negative returns ; that receive massive subsidies for capital investment ; and that are prepared to slug it out in market competition until capitalist adversaries throw in the towel . While specific techno-industrial development policies are needed , as long as those incentives are in place for Chinese firms , it will be critical for the United States to provide incentives for even the most patriotically minded CEO not to act in ways that will lose the war . That will likely entail thoroughly overhauling the corporate tax code to reduce or eliminate incentives for short-termism , while at the same time putting in place positive incentives for long-term investment , such as a stronger R & D tax credit and an investment tax credit . Fouth , the U.S. government needs to craft industry-specific strategies as part of an overarching national power industry strategy . Industries are all different in terms of their structures , competitive forces , technology needs , and other factors . While generic support policies like the R & D credit , infrastructure , and science investment can help the overall innovation and competitiveness environment , they lack the specificity needed to help firms in the United States compete effectively in global markets . So , we need a national semiconductor strategy , a national biopharma strategy , a national machine tool and robotics strategy , a national aerospace strategy , and more . These strategies would assess industries ’ strengths , weaknesses , opportunities , and threats in a classic “ SWOT ” analysis , and examine how a wide array of federal , state , and local policies impact their power and competitiveness . Box 6 : National Power Industry Policy vs. Industrial Policy At first glance , it would appear that national power industry strategy and traditional industrial policy ( industrial policy designed around U.S. competitiveness , as opposed to industrial policy for social goals such as climate change or social welfare ) would be quite similar . They are at the same level , as they both reject consumer-welfare , free-market economics and envision an active role for government in boosting value added output in certain industries . But there is where their similarity ends . Traditional industrial policy advocates stress its benefits for productivity . Oren Cass has stated that industrial policy is needed because the industries it grows “ are actually the place where we get a lot of our productivity growth over time. ” [ 333 ] But that ’ s no longer true , as manufacturing productivity growth has lagged behind overall economy productivity growth over the last 15 years or so . The pro-industrial policy group Prosperous America has written that industrial policy is “ essential to rebuilding U.S. industry and prosperity. ” [ 334 ] The logic is that industrial policy will boost output in industries with high value added per worker and by definition will reduce output in industries with lower value added per worker ( this is an identity because the models and theory have to assume full employment ) . When a country is early in its development phase , as South Korea was in the 1950s , this moving-up-the-value-chain model can be quite effective . Workers move from lower productivity sectors such as agriculture and textiles to higher productivity sectors such as steel and then semiconductors . But once an economy becomes fully industrialized , the potential gains from such a strategy are quite limited . For example , the Bureau of Economic Analysis ranks the 19 major manufacturing industries by value added per worker , with petroleum and coal products at $ 836,600 per worker and furniture and related products at just $ 69,000 . Assume that industrial policy boosts the higher value-added sector output and jobs by an average of 30 percent and reduces the lower value-added sector output and jobs by the same ( so the economy has the same number of manufacturing jobs ) , GDP would experience a one-time increase of $ 230 billion , or about 1 percent of GDP . [ 335 ] Even if we assume that the losses are in even lower value-added nonmanufacturing sectors such as retail trade and personal services , the gains would still be quite small , perhaps 2 to 3 percent of GDP . Second , traditional industrial policy is indifferent to industries in terms of their importance to national power . If an industry has high value added ( such as tobacco products ) , it ’ s a valuable industry , even if it has no impact on national power . In contrast , the goal of national power industry strategy is not to boost national income ; it ’ s to preserve national power , even if that means a lower standard of living because consumers are paying more for products than they would in a world where more of these products were imported . In addition , national power industry strategy is not agnostic toward industry type . These distinctions may seem esoteric—after all , both approaches embrace industrial policy . But in fact , they are key . Adopting the former strategy will have some positive effects on national power industries , but much of those effects may be irrelevant . The latter strategy will focus on national power industries , even if consumers and taxpayers pay a price . Political economy is almost everything . To be sure , articulating the right strategic framing for a national power industry strategy is key . But at the end of the day , what matters is executing and implementing that strategy . For the most part , the USG is lacking implementation capabilities . There are too few people in government with deep understanding of technology , industry , and national industry strategy . And too many government programs are bogged down with too many rules and restrictions to make them fully effective . The characteristics of the U.S. political economy will have a major influence on the extent to which the United States can put in place an effective national power industry strategy . Even if , by miracle , a president were elected who placed the U.S.-China techno-economic war as their top priority and were fully committed to formulating and carrying out a national power industry strategy , the odds of its success would be limited unless there were broad political support for it , or at least the absence of vociferous opposition . With regard to the political economy of a national power industry strategy , the single biggest factor is that the United States no longer has a developmental state . A developmental state works to prioritize industrial and economic development , along with technological innovation , to strengthen a nation ’ s competitive standing and geopolitical power . In this model , the state plays an active role in fostering specific sectors and capabilities , in contrast to the more hands-off approach of neoliberalism or the more antibusiness , redistribution of neo-New Deal liberalism . We have a developmental state for defense , but nothing else . With regard to the political economy of a national power industry strategy , the single biggest factor is that the United States no longer has a developmental state . What we have is a fight between a capitalist class that wants nothing more than to be left alone and a Left that wants to limit them and redistribute wealth and power . The U.S. political economy is made up of at least five key players : business , labor unions , civil society , universities , and government . And within each group , there are key subgroups . Unfortunately , none of the five groups fully supports a national power industry strategy . Arguably the most incisive analysis of the role of corporations in U.S. economic policy is from U.C . Berkely political science professor David Vogel in his 1979 article “ Why Businessmen Distrust Their State : The Political Consciousness of American Corporate Executives. ” [ 336 ] While Vogel wrote this almost 50 years ago , little has changed . Vogel tried to answer why such a large share of U.S. corporate leaders looked askance at the state and wanted little to do with it , unlike corporate leaders in Europe and rising Asian nations . He wrote : The business community has been remarkably consistent in its opposition to the enactment of any government policies that would centralize economic decision making or strengthen the authority of government over the direction of the business system as a whole . It is only with respect to policies that have their impact on particular firm or industry that its much heralded pragmatism at times comes into play . The criterion by which business evaluates government policy has remained quite firm : does the proposed intervention strengthen or weaken the autonomy of management ? [ 337 ] This was not , in Vogel ’ s view just some recent development ; it was baked into the evolution of the U.S. economy . He wrote that this : was an element in conservative doctrine throughout the first seventy-five years of the Republic . After the Civil War , however , it became clear that capitalism was now strong enough to get along without more active assistance from government than it already enjoyed . Equally important , it began to appear that in a partnership between government and business the danger of gratuitous political interference was becoming too serious to justify the risk . The idea of a positive relationship between government and economic life thus fell out of favor among those who underwrote the conservative program . [ 338 ] It wasn ’ t that the state per se would be inept of anticorporate , it was that democratic forces , albeit stronger in the United States than in any other nation , would capture the state in ways that would harm business and overall economic development . Again , Vogel wrote , “ Indeed , it was the fact that the state was not required to overthrow anticapitalist forces in the United States that leads to the unique view among U.S. business leaders. ” Vogel went on : The critical key to understanding why businessmen are more anti-statist than virtually any other major interest in American society lies in the unique role of the state at their institution ’ s birth . Business—both large and small—developed during a period when the state was relatively weak and small : in the case of virtually all other major national institutions , the state and the political process played a critical role in their formation… Accepting their nation ’ s most powerful legitimating ideology , they remain concerned that governmental policy will indeed come to reflect popular preferences . Their hostility to both the ideal and the idea of government involvement in the economy is significantly due to their lack of confidence in their ability to dominate the political process . Unlike France , Germany and Japan , we have no tradition of a strong and autocratic state or of a bureaucracy independent of popular pressures . [ 339 ] He added : This historical development pattern , doesn ’ t just shape business leaders ’ views toward business , it shapes their self-identity . For despite what Marxists might say , the United States does not have a unified , self-aware capitalist class , it has individual business leaders who see themselves as such for most interactions , every once in a while seeing them as part of a narrow industry , but almost never once as capitalists . [ 340 ] Vogel then wrote : The extent to which capitalism has been ideologically unchanged in America—either by an aristocracy or by a socialist working movement—has also inhibited American businessmen from developing a stronger sense of internal unity . A sense of classlessness that pervades American society , cited so frequently by both defenders and critics of America ’ s unique political tradition , not only made American unions relatively indifferent to socialist ideology ; the individualistic ethic that is so critical a component of the liberal tradition also inhibits a sense of solidarity within the bourgeoisie . Nearly one hundred and fifty years ago , de Tocqueville remarked : To tell the truth , though there are rich men , the class of rich men does not exist ; for these individuals have no feelings or purposes , no traditions or hopes , in common ; there are individuals , therefore , but no definitive class ... The rich are not compactly united among themselves .... In their intense and exclusive anxiety to make a fortune , they lose sight of the close connection which exists between the private fortune of each of them and the prosperity of all ... The discharge of political duties appears to them to be a troublesome annoyance , which diverts them from their occupations and business ... These people think that they are following the principle of self-interest , but the idea they entertain of that principle is a very rude one ; and the better to look after what they call their business , they neglect their chief business , which is to remain their own masters . [ 341 ] He quoted one business executive : “ We don ’ t have a business community . Just a bunch of self-interested people. ” 53 He further wrote , “ American businessmen appear to behave quite rationally toward government when the interests of their firm or industry are at stake , yet their understanding of the American business system remains remarkably shortsighted and provincial : they confuse their role as businessmen with their interests as capitalists. ” [ 342 ] This unfortunately has gotten worse , not better , since 1979 . As Vogel pointed out , because of the nature of capitalist development in the United States , where the state did not have to play a strong role to overthrow feudal interests , U.S. business leaders never adopted a very strong role as “ capitalists. ” But even so , their understanding of that role and the key importance of it declined significantly after the late 1970s . Before then , many corporate leaders saw themselves as not only as business leaders but also as corporate statesmen . CEOs such as Reg Jones of General Electric , Irving Shapiro of Dupont , Thomas Watson of IBM , David Packard of HP , George Romney of American Motors , and even John Young of HP in the 1980s spent considerable time advancing the interests of the nation , not just their own firms . And unless you are a diehard anticorporate advocate , there is no doubt that this advocacy strengthened America . But that started to die in the late 1970s and 1980s , prompted by the shareholder value movement and the libertarian notions of popular economic figures such as Milton Friedman , who proclaimed that the only purpose of business is to maximize profits . At one level , this is , of course , true . Companies have to make profits , or they can not stay in business . But if support for the capitalist system and the policies that support it are weakened , then the ability to earn individual profits is lessened . As Wall Street shifted from providing long-term capital for productive investment to a short-term extraction game—led by raiders such as Mike Miliken , Carl Icahn , Nelson Peltz , T. Boone Pickens , and others—CEOs could no longer afford anything but a focus on short-term profits . The capitalist system would have to take care of itself . And it has not . At the same time , corporate norms shifted and so what was once a system that enabled and largely required statesmanship was now one that penalized it . And the rise of intense global competition only contributed to that short-termism and selfish focus . Doug Henwood wrote that “ the transaction replaced the relationship—not just on Wall Street but in American business generally. ” [ 343 ] And it turns out that relationships are critical to the effective functioning and strength of the U.S. economy . At the same time , the decline of the traditional American WASP ruling class , with all its flaws , had the singular advantage of promoting leaders who were civic minded and not only self-interested , and played a key role . Say what you will about this class , it at least had an ethos of service to the nation . We saw this in the motto of private boarding school Groton , the lead training ground for American leadership class before the 1950s : “ Cui servire est regnare , ” which is conventionally translated as “ To serve is to rule. ” In other words , service was key . This didn ’ t mean that these leaders were always right or altruistic . It did mean that there was an expectation to serve and preserve the Republic . Today , WASPs are a timid minority that recognizes itself at its private clubs , but not much more . It ’ s not just the change in the system , it ’ s that the U.S. business community has not been able to generate its own leadership . Who are the top few business leaders who represent American business . Elon Musk ? Tim Cook ? Jamie Diamond ? Not really . Even in 1979 , Vogel dismissed the effectiveness of leading “ peak associations ” such as the Business Roundtable and the Council of Foreign Relations . He argued that the closest the capitalist class came to this was from the 1890s to 1920s , particularly with the leadership of Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan . Morgan was said to have told President Theordore Roosvelt during the Northern Securities antitrust case , “ If we have done anything wrong , send your man to my man and they can fix it up ” reflecting his centrality to U.S. business . [ 344 ] Vogel wrote that four factors weakened that : Since the 1920S four developments have markedly reduced the ability of corporate executives to generate their own political leadership : the decline of the dominance of the Morgan financial interests ; the reduction in market control of many of the turn-of-the-century monopolies , e.g. , Standard Oil , U.S. Steel , International Harvester ; the displacement of entrepreneurs by professional managers ; and the internationalization of U.S. corporations . The impact of the first two developments is obvious : they significantly decentralized authority within the corporate system , making it less likely that the position of any one firm could provide a point of departure for understanding the needs of business as a whole . Most of the voluminous literature on the separation of ownership and control is concerned with its impact on corporate economic behavior ; what has been overlooked is its impact on corporate political consciousness . This is serious : the managerial revolution severely undermined the formation of corporate class consciousness and business solidarity . [ 345 ] Their class consciousness and solidarity are now almost completely gone . The state itself will have to have stronger capabilities , of course , deeply informed by industry , but willing to act for U.S. national power , even when business support might be lacking . At the same time , in part because of the overreach of the neoliberal vision ( e.g. , tax cuts for upper-income Americans and excessive globalization , reduced public investment , and an acceptance of what was once seen as a fringe ideology , libertarianism ) what was once a Left that supported the American capitalist system but wanted it tamed and regulated to reduce excesses , is now largely antagonistic to the system . As an example , while Senator Elizabeth Warren ( D-MA ) will proclaim that she ’ s pro capitalist , this appears to be mostly a smoke screen to defend her anticorporate positions . All this has two major implications for the development of a national power industry strategy . First , it means that companies , even if they realize the nature of the China challenge , will be hesitant about asking for state help because they do not trust the ability of the state to either not get captured by nonbusiness interests or to effectively implement a developmental program . Such concerns are not unwarranted , as we saw with the politicization of the CHIPS program by the Biden administration and now the Trump administration . But there are policies and program designs that can limit such flaws , such as tax incentives and industry-led programs . Second , it means that there are few voices advancing the overall U.S. business interests , especially as they align with state interests . Few companies have the leeway to think much beyond their own firm ’ s interests—especially their near-term interests . This is not because the leadership is populated with selfish individuals . It is because they are operating in a financialized capitalist system wherein any behavior other than that will be punished by markets . As such , it means that the state itself will have to have stronger capabilities , of course deeply informed by industry , but willing to act for U.S. national power , even when business support might be lacking . Box 7 : From Shareholder Value Capitalism to National Power Capitalism The emergence of the shareholder value movement—the notion that the sole purpose of capitalist enterprises is to maximize profits—is often attributed to a 1970 New York Times Magazine article by economist Milton Friedman , who wrote that the purpose of a business “ is to increase its profits. ” [ 346 ] Radical libertarian Friedman saw anything other than extreme selfishness as socialism : This is the basic reason why the doctrine of “ social responsibility ” involves the acceptance of the socialist view that political mechanisms , not market mechanisms , are the appropriate way to determine the allocation of scarce resources to alternative uses . [ 347 ] Today , the shareholder value movement tolerates no other corporate purpose than producing short-term profits . Yet , from the early 1900s until the 1970s , there was a general view held by corporations that their mission was not just to increase stock price but also to serve other constituencies , including the national interests ( something libertarians such as Friedman do not believe exists ) . Eminent business scholar Peter F. Drucker represented this view in 1952 , writing : We believe today , both inside and outside the business world , that the business enterprise , especially the large business enterprise , exists for the sake of the contribution which it makes to the welfare of society as a whole . Our economic-policy discussions are all about what this responsibility involves and how best it can be discharged . There is , in fact , no disagreement , except on the lunatic fringes of the Right and on the Left , that business enterprise is responsible for the optimum utilization of that part of society 's always-limited productive resources which are under the control of the enterprise . [ 348 ] But beginning in the 1980s , changes in the institutional system of U.S. investing and management , under the rubric of the “ shareholder value movement , ” changed all that . How investment funds were structured and their managers were rewarded meant that funds moved money around in search of the quickest return , regardless of where long-term value might be found . How managers were compensated—increasingly with stock options that were not always related to actual managerial performance—reflected this new view that a manager ’ s job was to maximize value for the shareholders . And because managers themselves became key short-term stockholders ( through the significant growth of stock options ) , they made even more effort to enhance the welfare of short-term stockholders , including by boosting dividends and through stock buybacks . Now stock price was all that mattered , and the best way to get that price up was to engage in frenetic bidding wars to get the best CEO and top-level management team , which meant a massive increase in executive compensation . The rise of the shareholder value movement and its later evolution into corporate short-termism , or what some call “ quarterly capitalism , ” meant that CEOs were rewarded for downsizing firms , limiting investment in capital stock ( in order to maximize return on net assets ) , and paying attention solely to the bottom line . This focus on short-term returns was not rational in the sense of maximizing returns for society , or even for companies ( if returns are defined as maximizing the net present value of all future profits ) . The shareholder value revolution hurt national economic power . Indeed , as companies began paying out more in dividends and engaging in stock buybacks as a way to boost stock prices for short-term investors , relatively less was available for investing in activities that would boost national economic power . With the rise of the shareholder value movement came a shift in the political role and orientation of the corporate community . Prior to the mid-1980s , many CEOs , such as GM ’ s Charlie Wilson , GE ’ s Reginald Jones , HP ’ s John Young , DuPont ’ s Irving Shapiro , and Loral ’ s Bernard Schwartz , saw their role not just as CEO but as corporate statesman . But around that time , the role of “ business statesman ” began to fade . Executives came under increasing pressure to focus ruthlessly on boosting profits and share prices . Those who didn ’ t risked losing their jobs or seeing their companies swallowed up in hostile takeovers . This is not to say that some of today ’ s CEOs don ’ t try to play some broader role , but overall , U.S. corporate leaders have abdicated their roles as statesmen for roles as CEOs alone . In his book , The Fracturing of the Corporate Elite , Mark Mizruchi observed : [ After ] World War II , American business leaders hewed to an ethic of civic responsibility and enlightened self-interest.… In the 1970s , however , faced with inflation , foreign competition , and growing public criticism , corporate leaders became increasingly confrontational with labor and government . As they succeeded in taming their opponents , business leaders paradoxically undermined their ability to act collectively . [ 349 ] A survey by the corporate organization Committee for Economic Development supports this observation , finding that the three biggest barriers to business leaders taking a more active role in public issues were “ concern about criticism others have experienced ; shareholder pressure for short-term results ; and belief that a CEO should focus on his/her company. ” [ 350 ] For the CEOs , it became a collective action problem . Why step up and fight for big business and the U.S. economy generally when it only means taking valuable time away from your company ? As a thought experiment , try to name a current CEO who is seen as a leader for good policy for the American economy . Today , the lunatic fringes of the Right and Left are no longer fringes . The Right embraces Friedman ’ s shareholder value movement . Today ’ s Left , at best , talks about stakeholder capitalism ( e.g. , helping workers , the environment , and other interests ) . Some , such as radical globalist Klaus Scwab , even argue that the key stakeholder should be the entire global proletariat and environment . [ 351 ] Others , including many on the progressive Left , would have companies completely do away with a focus on profits , while others would wrap corporations up in a Gulliver-like straitjacket . [ 352 ] But even mainstream thinking has missed the point . The Business Roundtable says that the best companies “ put the customer first and invest in their employees and communities ” and supporting their suppliers . [ 353 ] For many , shareholder capitalism is following an alphabet soup of ESG ( environment , social , and governance ) goals . Absent is any discussion of the needs of the nation as a whole . What is needed is an alternative to shareholder capitalism that is not stakeholder capitalism . We need national power capitalism . In this framework , companies don ’ t ignore profit , but they work wherever possible to align that with U.S. and allied techno-economic and trade power . And they certainly do not oppose , and ideally support , national government policies to encourage the alignment of companies and the national interest . Just as corporations used to think of themselves as defenders of the system , so did organized labor . Of course , this was before labor unions were significantly weakened and now largely represent government workers , some low-pay service workers , and certain construction trades . Like corporations , unions focus largely on their own interests , in this case , demanding higher wages and benefits and resisting automation . A 2023 United Auto Workers strike led the Big Three U.S. automakers to grant workers at least 27 percent wage increases . [ 354 ] The Writers Guild strike resulted in studios agreeing to limit the use of AI to automate creative work . The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace struck for a 40 percent wage increase and a restoration of defined-benefit retirement plans . The question few are asking is what the effect will be on the global competitiveness of these companies , and by extension the U.S. economy . It ’ s one thing for a teachers ’ union to demand higher wages ; the only result would be higher taxes . But in industries that are globally traded , overly aggressive union demands often put firms at a competitive disadvantage—helping current union members in the short term , but hurting the firms , future workers , and the national economy in the long term as the firms become less competitive in global markets . We have the role of unions in leading to industrial decline in the United Kingdom , as all their incentives have been to maximize short-term gains at the expense of long-term stability . Even if unions realized the harm they were doing to their firms , all too often , they haven ’ t been able to stop themselves . As one scholar wrote with regard to U.K. unions : What occurred in industry after industry in the U.K. was a Greek tragedy.… Somehow workers in some sectors have found themselves destroying their firm , fully aware of what they were doing , yet unable to stop . They found themselves answering strike calls … in the full awareness that … the result could only be ruin for all concerned . [ 355 ] That description bears a striking resemblance to what has also occurred in many unionized U.S. industries . Around 2015 , I asked a former UAW leader whether , if the UAW had known in the 1970s and 1980s what it knows now about the decline of the Big Three , it would have done things differently . His response was , “ No. ” While he acknowledged that UAW actions hurt the Big Three ’ s global market share , he believed that union leadership could have acted no differently . If it had , he said , workers would have voted UAW leadership out and installed leaders who would stand up for the interests of workers now . Moreover , while some in the AFL-CIO have called for more industrial policy support , the lion ’ s share of its efforts to go boosting wages and expanding members . [ 356 ] On its web page “ What We Care About , ” the Federation lists better pay and benefits , civil rights , corporate greed , gender equality , global worker rights , immigration , infrastructure , and workplace health and safety . [ 357 ] Lower on the page , on a list of other issues , it does list manufacturing . As Vogel has rightly pointed out , institutionalized civil society after the New Deal accepted and even supported the corporate capitalist system . They just wanted to ensure that broader societal interests were adequately represented , and their concerns addressed . That is no longer the case . Most of these groups , largely funded by major left-wing foundations , now reject the U.S. capitalist system , seeing it as inherently evil and harmful . It is racist , sexist , imperialist , and every other “ ist. ” Hundreds of these often-well-funded groups push for ever stronger land use and environmental regulations , stronger privacy rules , stronger antitrust prosecution , higher business taxes , and technology bans . The philanthropy consultancy , Blue Tent , has identified over 200 left-leaning foundations in America . [ 358 ] These include groups that reject copyright enforcement , seek to hold tech firms “ accountable , ” promote technology justice , protect individual privacy , oppose new technologies such as facial recognition and AI , highlight “ power imbalances , ” and want to break-up large firms and regulate large telecom providers to bridge various digital divides . The Ford Foundation alone has funded nearly 100 nonprofit advocacy groups focused on “ public interest technology. ” [ 359 ] Not one comes close to supporting a national power industry strategy . Most of these groups , largely funded by major left-wing foundations , now reject the U.S. capitalist system , seeing it as inherently evil and harmful . At the same time , most free-market foundations fund organizations that are diametrically opposed to the government development of a national power industry strategy because their task is less government . While that can be an important component of a national power industry strategy , if it focuses on eliminating or streamlining regulations inimical to national power industry competitiveness , overall , they oppose the areas where government needs to be more active and strategic . In addition , a variety of nonprofits now mobilize political interests to not only prevent any reforms needed to better compete with China , but also to rachet up new regulatory restrictions . We see this with the pressure environmental organizations exert any time Congress attempts even the most common-sense reform of environmental laws . A national power industry strategy would entail a very different role for U.S. research universities . They would , among other things , need to focus more on STEM education , especially for Americans ; on research areas critical to success in national power industries ; and on working more closely with industry to ensure that more of the benefits of that research flow to firms in America , rather than China . But the problem is that U.S. universities resist the imposition of even guidance from the federal government . As Vogel argued that U.S. business executives value autonomy from government above all else , the same is true with faculty , who ultimately call the shots at universities . We have seen this with the reaction to President Trump ’ s “ Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education , ” which would provide universities with a set of benefits if they adopt the measures in the Compact . The point here is not whether the Compact is good , or if the president has the authority to implement it ; it ’ s to show the utter focus on autonomy by higher education . For example , in rejecting the invitation to join , Brown University ’ s president , Christina Paxson , said that the compact “ by its nature and by various provisions would restrict academic freedom and undermine the autonomy of Brown ’ s governance. ” [ 360 ] Todd Wolfson , president of the American Association of University Professors ( AAUP ) , stated : By declining to compromise its core mission , Brown University has affirmed that no amount of federal inducement is worth surrendering the freedom to question , explore and dissent . In rejecting the compact , Brown stands as a bulwark for higher education ’ s sacred commitment to academic freedom and institutional self-governance . [ 361 ] To be sure , they would be mostly correct if they were not receiving funding from taxpayers through federal grants . If they want to give up that , then have at it . But the acceptance of federal funding should come with it an expectation to act in the national interest , not just the university ’ s own interest , however it defines it . Academic freedom is a code word for being able to say and do whatever they want with virtually no constraints . But with the national industry power war , it is in the national interest for universities to operate differently . This means boosting the quality of undergraduate education from its fairly mediocre levels . Keeping tuition increases reasonable so students can afford education without federal subsidies . Focusing more on STEM education , especially for American students . And focusing on research critical to the success of national power industries . With the national industry power war , it is in the national interest for universities to operate differently . However , as we saw with the vociferous resistance by higher education to the provisions in the Endless Frontier Act ( which was incorporated with the CHIPS Act to become the Chips and Science Act ) that would have given most of the increase in National Science Foundation funding to the Technology Innovation Partnerships program rather than to traditional programs , we can expect most higher education institutions to actively resist ensuring that higher ed policy be guided by a national advanced industry strategy . They will continue to trot out stale bromides such as academic freedom and Vannevar Bush ’ s linear model of science that lets researchers study whatever they want and only focus on research publications . Universities that agree to support U.S. national power industries would likely be attacked by their fellow universities and academics . Finally , government . The state itself is an actor advancing interests : something the MAGA right calls the “ deep state , ” implying that government interests are not national interests . Notwithstanding this radical view , the U.S. state itself is actually weak . Vogel nailed it when he wrote , “ The American state still lacks essential information about the basic functioning of the economy and even if that information were available the fragmentation of authority and power within the federal bureaucracy would make any coordinated government policy extremely problematic. ” [ 362 ] Given the hollowing out of the federal government since he wrote this in 1979 , including the recent calamity of the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ) haphazardly slashing and burning bureaucracy , this is even more true now . [ 363 ] To the extent that the state has real capacity , it is largely limited to DOD , and as discussed in later work on policy steps , the problem is that DOD ( or now called the Department of War ) has become another interest group , focusing on advancing its own narrow military interests rather than national power writ large , especially through a national power industry strategy . In writing about how corporations have to succeed , Gary Hamel and Prahalad stated : To create the future , an entire company , not just a few isolated boffins or ” research fellows ” must possess industry foresight . Top management can not abdicate its responsibility for developing , articulating and sharing a point of view about the future . What is needed are not just skunk works and intrapreneurs , but senior managers who can escape the orthodoxies of the corporation ’ s current “ concept of self. ” [ 364 ] DOD has become another interest group , focusing on advancing its own narrow military interests rather than national power writ large , especially through a national power industry strategy . They went on to write : Making industry and company conventions explicit , understanding how these conventions could imperil the firm ’ s success in the future , delving deeply into industry discontinuities , establishing a process for extending industry foresight and working collectively to craft a strategic architecture are the means for genetic reengineering on a large scale . [ 365 ] That is all the more true for the USG . But today ’ s few SES ( Senior Executive Service ) or political appointees have those capabilities , and as discussed later , there are few easy ways by which they can attain them . When David Vogel wrote his book , majorities in both parties accepted both government and corporate capitalism . The Republicans were always a bit more on the side of corporations . The Democrats were on the side of civil society and used the state to advanced broader public interests and concerns , especially workers ’ and consumers ’ . Now most of the Right wants significantly limited government and some no longer trust corporate America . And much of the Left has rejected large corporations and the capitalist system itself . Vogel noted how the U.S. democratic system , with its open democracy , was one of the few developed economies without a socialist opposition : Whatever may be inconveniences of a relatively open and responsive governmental system to the achievement of specific corporate objectives—and they are often considerable - they are clearly the price the American bourgeoisie pays for a luxury enjoyed by no other business community in the advanced capitalist nations—the absence of a socialist opposition . American executives continually complain about the large number of organizations and interest groups that routinely turn to the state to redress their grievances against the corporation , but this state of affairs certainly preferable to one in which these non or antibusiness factions did not use the political process because they perceived it as fixed against them . The latter would seriously undermine the political stability upon which a sound economic system depends . [ 366 ] That is no longer the case . A large swath of progressives now embrace socialism , even if they do not call it that . And it is quite possible that America will become like Europe : a social welfare state wherein socialism represents the Left . Given that any effective national power industry strategy has to be built around large corporations and a strong government role , all this bodes ill for the ability to take effective action . For conservatives , it ’ s just as bad , if not worse . For much of the post New-Deal through to the election of President Reagan , the business community , and more important conservative intellectuals accepted the New Deal . As Vogel wrote : At his presidential address delivered to the annual meeting of the American Economic Association in 1962 , Edward S. Mason noted …the fact that the really revolutionary changes in the role of government and in the relation of various groups to government produced by the depression and the war have not yet been fully accepted in this country . Where counter-revolution is still considered to be a possibility no one is quite prepared to lay down his arms . [ 367 ] Dwight Eisenhower warned that abolishing New Deal programs would undermine any political party ’ s viability , and for decades , Republicans largely grudgingly heeded that caution . Even though many on the Right have long viewed Wilson ’ s New Freedom , Roosevelt ’ s New Deal , and Johnson ’ s Great Society as fundamental deviations from America ’ s founding principles , conservative politicians , like liberals , have dared not touch them . The policies and programs of those eras were assumed to be sacrosanct pillars of the post-World War II power and prosperity we have known as the American Century . But the counterrevolution was always nascent , occasionally breaking out with someone like Goldwater or Gingrich . Now the counterrevolution has triumphed , working to restore the nation to the pre-New Deal , and even pre-Wilson era . [ 368 ] President Trump and the MAGA movement , buoyed by a perception of the Biden administration ’ s overreach , are now actively revolting against all that was once held sacred . Many are doing so under the banner of “ drain the swamp. ” More fundamentally , though , the animating desire is to return to the governance of more than a century ago—that of the Gilded Age , an era of small government , protective tariffs , limited immigration , and America as regional power—a period that reached its zenith during the Republican administration of President William McKinley . Given that any effective national power industry strategy has to be built around large corporations and a strong government role , all this bodes ill for the ability to take effective action . Ironically , the business community in the United States distrusts the state because it worries that it will be captured by populist forces that neither understand nor care about the economic system—and even more ominously , they will try to dismantle that system . With such a risk always in the background , U.S. corporate leaders have long preferred to be left alone , and to support a weak central government . If America is to not lose the national power industry war to China , it needs a political economy that puts the restoration of U.S. power , especially from national power industries , at the center . It is ironic that in a Marxist-Leninist China , the last thing the state wants is for democratic forces to derail capitalist progress . To be sure , the CCP inserts itself into capitalists ’ business , but it is only to 1 ) make sure that the capitalists do not challenge the Party and 2 ) to make sure that the companies advance CCP and Chinese power globally . If America is to not lose the national power industry war to China , it needs a political economy that puts the restoration of U.S. power , especially from national power industries , at the center . Until recently , China ’ s playbook was to imitate the advances of industrialized countries , but since the 12th Five-Year Plan ( 2011–2015 ) , the Chinese government has shifted its strategy toward incentivizing innovation . We see that in a variety of advanced sectors . China has named biotechnology as a strategic emerging industry and has set development priorities for drugs , biomedical engineering , agriculture , and biomanufacturing . It has developed a comprehensive national strategy to enhance the innovation capabilities of its domestic biotech industry . The strategy includes subsidies , financial incentives , national reimbursement for innovative therapies ; the creation of high-tech science parks , start-up incubators , and public-private partnerships ; talent recruitment initiatives ; reforms to expedite drug review , especially for domestic products ; and efforts to enhance IP protection to foster innovation . China has set several milestones and goals for the industry , including enhancing the originality of biotech through new technologies and products , creating a biotech innovation platform , and strengthening the industrialization of biotechnology . To implement this strategy , China has increased R & D activity and built out its innovation infrastructure—science parks , incubators , and national gene and cell banks . The number of high-quality biotech publications and clinical trials in China has surged . Still , structural challenges remain , such as inconsistent hospital data systems and difficulty translating scientific research into market-ready products , with China lagging behind the United States in commercialization capabilities . However , it is expected that the Chinese share of the global biotech drug market will grow significantly , at the cost of Western leaders ’ market share . China ’ s quantum strategy reflects a clear belief that competing in this field requires central political control , not just industrial strength . Rather than backing a decentralized commercial ecosystem like in the United States , Beijing has placed universities and state-run labs at the center of its quantum push , with funding , talent , and political oversight all flowing through the Party apparatus . The focus is on the areas where state coordination can yield strategic wins—namely , quantum communications and sensing , which are easier to deploy and carry direct national security value . To implement this strategy , the government has folded private industry into its preferred channels . High-profile exits , such as Alibaba and Baidu abandoning their quantum research divisions and transferring their assets to state-linked institutions , reflect a system wherein firms are discouraged from independent leadership and instead are expected to serve as suppliers or technical partners to state-led projects . Rather than bet on uncertain , long-term breakthroughs in quantum computing , China is locking in an early advantage in quantum key distribution ( QKD ) and quantum sensors , which are more mature fields that can scale faster and shape international norms . For the United States , the impact is dual . First , China ’ s rapid progress in quantum communications and sensing shortens the window for U.S. institutions to upgrade to post-quantum secure systems . That raises national security risks ; if adversaries establish quantum-secure channels or advance quantum sensing before the United States adapts , it could compromise intelligence , defense , and critical infrastructure . Second , China ’ s early dominance in export-ready quantum systems , especially sensing technologies , threatens U.S. competitiveness in emerging markets . By offering heavily subsidized AI solutions through state-directed firms , China could lock in long-term customers and establish its standards as the default , making it harder for U.S. companies to enter or influence these strategic sectors later on . China is using state power to tilt the AI playing field . Rather than relying on market dynamics alone , China is using state-led tools—subsidies , open-source acceleration , massive data access , and political endorsement—to build national champions and crowd out foreign competitors . Tsinghua-affiliated start-ups such as Zhipu AI and Moonshot AI , backed by government-linked funding and supercomputing access , show how China incubates AI firms within a politically protected ecosystem . These firms now produce competitive large language models , and some , such as DeepSeek , outperform U.S. peers on key benchmarks . China implements this strategy by tightly aligning AI firms ’ development with state priorities . The government funnels capital through targeted venture funding , particularly benefiting companies overlooked by private markets , and supports strategic partnerships that quickly scale AI platforms . Firms such as DeepSeek receive explicit political endorsement , securing privileged market positions and accelerating their ability to innovate and commercialize . Furthermore , China leverages its enormous population to generate extensive , unrestricted datasets , feeding AI models at a scale unattainable in democratic societies constrained by privacy rules . This creates a structural advantage , allowing Chinese firms to train advanced AI systems more cost-effectively and rapidly . If China ’ s model for AI becomes the reference point in fast-growing markets , U.S. firms may find themselves shut out of both standards-setting processes and adoption pathways . This doesn ’ t mean replicating China ’ s model , but it does mean recognizing the structural advantages it creates and rethinking the domestic policies that may be holding U.S. companies back . China has pursued an ambitious strategy to become the world ’ s leading EV and battery manufacturer and , in so doing , displace “ Western ” ( including Japan and South Korea ) leadership in internal combustion engine ( ICE ) vehicles . The Chinese government began investing in EV-related technologies as early as 2001 , when EV technology was introduced as a priority science research project in China ’ s 10th Five-Year Plan . Subsidies have proven indispensable in building Chinese EV competitiveness . From 2009 to 2023 alone , China channeled $ 230.9 billion in subsidies and other support to its domestic EV sector . From 2018 to 2023 , the Chinese government extended $ 1.8 billion in subsidies to EV battery developer CATL ( Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. , Limited ) alone . Chinese policymakers have put their thumb on the scale for electric as opposed to ICE vehicle adoption , such as by giving EV owners license plates at no cost and not subjecting them to traffic control measures . China has established the world ’ s largest public charging infrastructure network . Growth in Chinese competitiveness in autos has been astounding . In 1985 , Chinese enterprises manufactured a grand total of 5,200 passenger vehicles ; by 2024 , they produced 26.8 million vehicles ( including 10 million EVs ) —21 percent of global production—a share automotive analysts expect will reach one-third by 2030 . The Alliance for Automotive Manufacturing has referred to Chinese EV growth as a potential “ extinction-level event. ” While Chinese EV makers have yet to make significant inroads in the U.S. market , they ’ re capturing considerable market share in third-market countries . The United States has responded by offering 100 percent tariffs on Chinese EV imports . Ever since the 2013 Third Party Plenum , the Chinese government has made semiconductors the country ’ s top industrial innovation priority . China ’ s “ 2014 National Guidelines for Development and Promotion of the Integrated Circuit Industry ” called for $ 150 billion in central government investments to establish a fully “ closed-loop ” semiconductor ecosystem in China . The plan called for eliminating China ’ s trade deficit in ICs by 2030 and achieving 70 percent self-sufficiency in semiconductors by that year . Chris Miller has suggested that adding up semiconductor-sector investments made by Chinese governments at all levels , China “ has probably invested the equivalent of [ America ’ s ] CHIPS Act virtually every year since 2014. ” [ 369 ] One OECD study of the global semiconductor industry from 2014–2018 found that China accounted for 86 percent of all below-market equity injections and that subsidies accounted for 40 percent of foundry SMIC ’ s revenues . The Chinese government stood up NAND memory-maker YMTC from whole cloth by a $ 24 billion investment . China added more chip-making capacity than the rest of the world combined in 2024 , with most centered in the legacy ( 28 nm or greater ) market , which is particularly concerning because Chinese companies are gaining a foothold there and selling products 20–30 percent less than Western competitors , disrupting the industry ’ s innovation economics . Huawei Ascend AI and Kirin mobile chips are increasingly capable and pose market share threats to U.S. companies in China and third-party markets . Elsewhere , Document 79 articulates an import substitution approach that has directed Chinese EV and ICT firms to remove foreign semiconductors from their products . The final report in this Chinese National Power Industry War series will be a comprehensive and detailed policy agenda . But as a way to frame that , based on the argument presented here , this appendix briefly describes major changes needed in various policy areas . For the free-market Right , the goal of antitrust is short-term consumer welfare ; and for the populist Left and Right , the goal is attacking and breaking up big companies . It is time to incorporate a national power industry “ screen ” in antitrust analysis and enforcement wherein national power industries would be treated differently . Merger review , as well as enforcement , would be viewed in equal part of how much the actions would hurt U.S. power industry capabilities . U.S. environmental regulation came of age in an era of supposed plenty with virtually no international industry competition . And over the years , it was largely a one-way ratchet , with more regulation added on . Some regulation makes sense . But much of it could be implemented in ways that are less damaging to competitiveness and with lower compliance costs . And some are just unnecessary . The poster child of this is the National Environmental Protection Act , which imposes massive costs and delays , or even bans , on needed development . Again , as with antitrust , environmental regulation needs to reformed and implemented through the “ screen ” of national power industry health . Industry is regulated in a number of ways besides environmental regulation . This includes sector-specific regulation ( e.g. , freight rail , housing construction , etc . ) , data privacy regulation , worker safety , and others . Again , as with environmental regulation , these were put in place and enforced with little consideration for impact on national power industry competitiveness . That needs to change . For most Republicans ( and neoclassical economists ) , the best business tax code is a broad base ( few to no exemptions of incentives and a low rate ) . For most Democrats , the best business tax code is one that raises the effective tax rate of large corporations . A national power industry-based tax code reduces the effective rate on business , but especially on national power industries , by boosting specific incentives to align their interests with national interests for a strong national power industry sector . Both parties are afraid of the wrath of selfish American voters of raising taxes on anyone but the rich . And most Republicans favor cutting USG discretionary spending , including on activities that would support U.S. national power industry competitiveness . Most Democrats want to boost spending to help current consumers and workers , even if this means less public investment that would support power industries . And both parties are terrified of controlling entitlement spending , even though without that , there is almost no way to generate the fiscal headroom for the kinds of direct and indirect ( tax ) expenditures needed to win the national power industry war with China . Most in Washington are loathe to prioritize particular industries in trade policy— '' agriculture is as important as aerospace. ” That needs to change , where the interests of U.S. national power industries are paramount on trade policy and negotiations may require comprising with other nations in ways that hurt nonpower industries while helping U.S. power industries . At the same time , traditional trade supporters see free trade with all nations as good , and populist trade advocates on both the Right and the Left now reject global trade and seek autocracy ; sometimes euphemistically called a “ trade agenda for the middle class. ” A national power industry trade agenda prioritizes China , including strengthening allied trade relations and allied efforts to restrict Chinese exports , especially of power industry goods and services . U.S. foreign policy on the right prioritizes the United States being the policeman throughout the world . On the Left , it prioritizes pushing for human rights throughout the world , including in China . In addition , foreign policy has long been willing to spend “ national power industry capital ” to achieve these globalist foreign policy goals . We see this in how the United States has consistently engaged in export controls to punish nations for taking actions we didn ’ t like , even though that came at the cost of U.S. power industry competitiveness . A national power industry foreign policy prioritizes China over all else , and seeks to advance U.S. national power interests throughout the world . Since the start of the first Cold War , U.S. policy has idolatrized small business , blessing it with a wide panoply of regulatory , tax , and spending protections and favors . The Left supports it because it believes that it can convince petit-bourgeois small business owners to think of themselves as part of the proletariat oppressed by large capitalist corporations . The Right supports them because they see them as being driven by Adam Smith-like competition , unlike large supposedly woke , crony capitalist large corporations . In a world of national power industry war with China , the nation can longer afford to do this . It costs too much money , and it weakens power industry firms . In a power industry world , all U.S. policy would become size neutral . Banking and investment regulation has largely supported financial markets , even though many of them have become zero-sum casinos benefiting a small cadre of billionaire hedge fund managers , driving national power industry corporations toward short-term financial maximization at the cost of long-term competitiveness . Investment regulation needs to focus first on how to drastically reduce the size of the industry as it sucks off needed talent and GDP away from national power industries . Second , it needs to reform the industry away from its parasitic short-termism toward long-term national wealth and power creation . Science policy still is under the post-WWII shadow of Vannevar Bush and the linear model of science focused on prioritizing early-stage basic science of whatever scientists want to study . Science policy should evolve to “ science , technology , and engineering ” policy and more money should go to targeted areas critical to advancing U.S. national power industries and in ways that involve industry more . Whether that can be done at the National Science Foundation with its deep commitment to the desires of individual scientists and research universities , or whether it requires the creation of separate institution is an open question . There is a reason the United States has no real national power industry strategy and why so few policy areas are aligned to support that . And it is because there are few forces in American politics pushing for this . Most Republicans , including most “ Trumpians , ” still are committed to small government and “ freedom ” from government . That is largely what the president wants . And most Democrats now are firmly redistributionists , wanting more now , especially for those “ oppressed ” by the U.S. capitalist system and big corporations . That is largely what President Biden pushed for . Not losing the national power industry war with China requires more state capacity and action , strong support for power industry corporations , and way more sacrifice of current consumption toward future investment . As Robert Kagan of the Brookings Institution put it : If and when American power declines , the institutions and norms that American power has supported will decline , too . Or more likely , if history is a guide , they may collapse altogether as we make a transition to another kind of world order , or to disorder . We may discover then that the U.S. was essential to keeping the present world order together and that the alternative to American power was not peace and harmony but chaos and catastrophe—which is what the world looked like right before the American order came into being .

US,cset.georgetown.edu,news,2024-06-28T16:46:33+00:00,Center for Security and Emerging Technology,"CSET’s Helen Toner shared her expert analysis in an article published by The Wall Street Journal. The article discusses China’s accelerated push to compete with the U.S. in generative artificial intelligence. Jacob Feldgoise and Hanna Dohmen Since 2019, the U.S. government has imposed restrictive export controls on Huawei—one of China’s leading tech giants—seeking, in part, to hinder the company’s AI chip development efforts. This data snapshot reveals how exactly Huawei’s latest AI chip—the Ascend 910B—improves on the prior generation and demonstrates how export controls are likely hindering Huawei’s production. This analysis of Huawei’s first-generation Ascend 910 series (2019) and second-generation Ascend 910B series (2022) suggests that despite facing export controls, Huawei was able to design a higher-performing chip that could be manufactured domestically at SMIC and meet some of China’s domestic demand for AI compute. Nonetheless, our analysis reveals that the performance increase is smaller than advertised; only 75 percent of the theoretical maximum performance increase can be attributed to an actual increase in hardware performance. Additionally, Huawei reduced the number of active AI cores between the 910 and 910B series—likely either due to poor yields or limited capacity on SMIC’s 7nm fabrication process. While Huawei’s development is significant and demonstrates China’s progress in chip design and manufacturing, U.S. export controls have almost certainly slowed Huawei’s progress. Over the last two years, the United States implemented export controls on the chips needed to develop and deploy the most advanced AI systems, seeking to deny China access to those chips. As U.S. policymakers evaluate the policy’s effectiveness, an important indicator to monitor is China’s domestic AI chip design and manufacturing progress. To provide insight into China’s AI chip design progress, CSET is tracking over 180 AI chip products designed by over 30 Chinese organizations. Of particular interest is Huawei’s AI chip development. Despite being Entity-listed since 2020, Huawei brought AI chips to market that are comparable to one of NVIDIA’s higher performing chips—the A100. In fact, Huawei’s Ascend chips are some of the most advanced Chinese AI chips and are likely the most widely deployed. 1 In this data snapshot, we provide insights into how Huawei has been able to domestically design and manufacture AI chips despite U.S. export controls, including what challenges Huawei likely faced and how it worked around limitations. In 2019, Huawei released its top-of-the-line Ascend 910 chips fabricated on TSMC’s 7nm process node. The chip quickly gained traction in China; it was installed in data centers affiliated with the Chinese government and incorporated into numerous server products. 2 But Huawei was forced to halt production with TSMC in 2020 when the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) at the U.S. Department of Commerce placed Huawei on the Entity List and imposed the Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR) on the company. This extraterritorial control effectively prohibited foreign foundries from manufacturing Huawei’s chips, kneecapping Huawei’s ability to produce its Ascend 910 chips. Two years later, Huawei began selling a second generation of Ascend 910 chips—called the Ascend 910B series—which are fabricated domestically in mainland China. 3 Due to Huawei’s close collaboration with Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), these chips appear to be among the select few to use China’s most advanced but highly limited 7nm fabrication capacity. Comparing the two generations of Ascend 910 chips provides insights into how Huawei is designing and manufacturing around U.S. export controls, in particular the FDPR, to supply the Chinese market with high-performance AI chips. 4 To inform this analysis, we reviewed technical documentation for both generations of Ascend 910 chips and technical documentation for over 20 server products that incorporate those chips. While both generations of the Ascend 910 chips are similarly designed, a few key differences are worth noting. The second-generation Ascend 910B chips have higher maximum performance, a higher clock speed but fewer active AI cores, one additional vector unit in each AI core, and a newer memory type with higher bandwidth and capacity. Huawei created five models of the first-generation Ascend 910 chip, the highest performing of which appears to be capable of 320 FP16 TFLOPS. To put this in context, this is roughly comparable to NVIDIA’s A100, which was state-of-the-art in 2020. 5 Ascend 910 models range from 30-32 active AI cores. Each AI core contains one matrix execution unit and one vector execution unit; both types of units are needed to train AI models, but most of the core’s performance comes from the matrix unit, which is specially designed for AI operations. The second-generation 910B series, likely released in 2022, has at least four models. The highest performing of these four models appears to be capable of 400 FP16 TFLOPS. All four models have fewer active AI cores, ranging from 20-25. A key difference between the two generations is that each AI core of the second generation contains one matrix execution unit and two vector execution units—one more vector unit than the previous generation. Huawei likely added a second vector unit because the sole vector unit may have had insufficient throughput, becoming a bottleneck for the matrix unit. 6 With an additional vector unit the second-generation Ascend 910B likely can more quickly perform vector operations, which may increase overall AI training and speed. Additionally, compared with the first-generation series, the 910B has twice as much on-chip memory, which should relieve memory bottlenecks and help the chip’s actual performance approach its theoretical maximum. The 910B also features a newer external memory type (HBM2e) with higher bandwidth and double the maximum memory capacity. See Table 1 for a direct comparison between the first- and second-generation Ascend 910 chips. Huawei also created the Ascend 910C series, which likely was intended to double the performance of the 910B series by doubling the number of active AI cores. However, potentially due to manufacturing issues, Huawei ultimately reduced the specifications for the 910C series to match those of the 910B. 7 Table 1: Key Specifications for First- and Second-Generation Ascend 910 Series Chips 8 The increase in theoretical maximum performance from the first-generation Ascend 910 (320 TFLOPS) to the second-generation Ascend 910B (400 TFLOPS) is a significant upgrade. However, a deeper analysis reveals that the performance difference between the first- and second-generation chips is lower than it appears. In general, a chip’s performance is calculated by multiplying the clock speed (i.e., the number of cycles a chip can perform per second) and the throughput of the chip (i.e., the number of operations a chip can perform per cycle). Based on CSET analysis, there are three factors responsible for the 80 TFLOPS increase in theoretical performance from the first-generation to the second-generation Ascend 910B chips. Half of the increase (40 TFLOPS) comes as a result of the second-generation Ascend 910B being clocked at a higher speed. Increasing the clock speed means that a chip is able to cycle more times per second, which increases the speed of operation and leads to overall higher performance. Per cycle, the two generations have nearly identical throughput aside from an additional vector unit per core and an accounting change, which are responsible for the remaining increase in performance. More specifically, about a fourth (20 TFLOPS) of the increase can be attributed to the additional vector unit per core incorporated in the 910B. The remaining fourth (20 TFLOPS) comes as a result of an accounting change in how Huawei calculated the chips’ performance. Figure 1. Factors Responsible for the Increase in TFLOPS Between Ascend 910 and Ascend 910B 9 Between the first- and second-generation Ascend 910 chips, Huawei changed which operations it counted towards performance. Even though the first generation appears able to run matrix and vector operations in parallel, Huawei only counted operations performed by matrix units towards the chip’s peak performance—excluding operations performed by the vector units. 10 For the second generation, however, Huawei counted operations from both the matrix and vector units. If we applied the same accounting method to the first-generation Ascend 910 chip (i.e., counting both matrix and vector units towards performance), it would have a maximum theoretical performance of 340 TFLOPS. As a result, the real improvement in maximum theoretical performance is only 60 TFLOPS rather than 80 TFLOPS. As explained above, the second-generation 910B series uses significantly fewer active AI cores than the first-generation 910 series, suggesting yield or capacity constraints on SMIC’s manufacturing process. There are two likely reasons why the second-generation 910B has fewer AI cores. The first possibility is that both generations use 32 total AI cores, but because the yields of SMIC’s 7nm process are low, only 20-25 cores could be activated per 910B series chip. The second possibility is that Huawei made a die with fewer total AI cores, allowing Huawei to fabricate more chips per wafer using SMIC’s limited 7nm fabrication capacity. This could also be an effort to offset the likely die area increase resulting from adding more on-chip memory to the chip. 11 Whether due to SMIC’s poor yields or limited capacity, Huawei reduced the number of active AI cores between the 910 and 910B—successfully designing a chip that could be manufactured domestically at SMIC and supplied to the Chinese market. But to accomplish this, Huawei needed at least two years—from when the FDPR was applied in 2020 to when the 910B series first appeared in technical documentation in 2022—to redesign and domestically fabricate the chip. Meanwhile, since 2020, leading U.S. AI chip design companies designed and produced new chips capable of performance that surpasses any Huawei Ascend chip. 12 Huawei’s Ascend 910 and 910B chips are both consequential innovations. The first-generation 910 demonstrated that Huawei was a fast follower in AI chip design; Huawei unveiled the 910 before NVIDIA’s A100—claiming similar performance on paper but falling short in practice. Then, in 2022, despite extraterritorial U.S. export controls, Huawei produced the second-generation Ascend 910B chip with improved performance and memory—a true Chinese-made alternative to NVIDIA’s now-restricted A100. Today, the 910B is available through Huawei’s own cloud services and has been purchased by Chinese companies, including Baidu, Tencent, and iFLYTEK. The chip’s performance and (albeit limited) commercial success demonstrate how Huawei is already producing the exact type of chip that U.S. export controls intend to restrict China from obtaining. Nonetheless, Huawei’s production capacity and technology leadership are both constrained by serious limitations. Huawei faces numerous challenges in meeting the demands of the Chinese market with its most advanced AI chips, primarily because of manufacturing constraints. SMIC’s yield rates and cost efficiency appear to be low, making this an expensive endeavor for Huawei, SMIC, and their government backers. Additionally, SMIC’s 7nm production capacity remains limited, forcing Huawei to decide between manufacturing its most advanced smartphone chips (i.e., the Kirin 9000S) or its AI chips. These challenges will likely continue to limit China’s access to advanced AI chips, at least in the short term, until SMIC is able to improve yields and bring more production capacity online. The 910B demonstrates that Huawei is continuing to innovate under export controls but is falling behind. The Ascend 910B is only an incremental improvement over the first-generation 910. In a fast-moving technology space where the industry leaders have tripled chip performance between recent generations, the 910B’s performance is only 1.2 times that of the first-generation 910. 13 The future of Huawei’s leadership in AI chip technology will depend on whether the company can make consistent, transformative design and packaging innovations to compensate for the manufacturing improvements denied to China by U.S. export controls.

The article discusses China ’ s accelerated push to compete with the U.S. in generative artificial intelligence . Jacob Feldgoise and Hanna Dohmen Since 2019 , the U.S. government has imposed restrictive export controls on Huawei—one of China ’ s leading tech giants—seeking , in part , to hinder the company ’ s AI chip development efforts . This data snapshot reveals how exactly Huawei ’ s latest AI chip—the Ascend 910B—improves on the prior generation and demonstrates how export controls are likely hindering Huawei ’ s production . This analysis of Huawei ’ s first-generation Ascend 910 series ( 2019 ) and second-generation Ascend 910B series ( 2022 ) suggests that despite facing export controls , Huawei was able to design a higher-performing chip that could be manufactured domestically at SMIC and meet some of China ’ s domestic demand for AI compute . Nonetheless , our analysis reveals that the performance increase is smaller than advertised ; only 75 percent of the theoretical maximum performance increase can be attributed to an actual increase in hardware performance . Additionally , Huawei reduced the number of active AI cores between the 910 and 910B series—likely either due to poor yields or limited capacity on SMIC ’ s 7nm fabrication process . While Huawei ’ s development is significant and demonstrates China ’ s progress in chip design and manufacturing , U.S. export controls have almost certainly slowed Huawei ’ s progress . Over the last two years , the United States implemented export controls on the chips needed to develop and deploy the most advanced AI systems , seeking to deny China access to those chips . As U.S. policymakers evaluate the policy ’ s effectiveness , an important indicator to monitor is China ’ s domestic AI chip design and manufacturing progress . To provide insight into China ’ s AI chip design progress , CSET is tracking over 180 AI chip products designed by over 30 Chinese organizations . Of particular interest is Huawei ’ s AI chip development . Despite being Entity-listed since 2020 , Huawei brought AI chips to market that are comparable to one of NVIDIA ’ s higher performing chips—the A100 . In fact , Huawei ’ s Ascend chips are some of the most advanced Chinese AI chips and are likely the most widely deployed . 1 In this data snapshot , we provide insights into how Huawei has been able to domestically design and manufacture AI chips despite U.S. export controls , including what challenges Huawei likely faced and how it worked around limitations . In 2019 , Huawei released its top-of-the-line Ascend 910 chips fabricated on TSMC ’ s 7nm process node . The chip quickly gained traction in China ; it was installed in data centers affiliated with the Chinese government and incorporated into numerous server products . 2 But Huawei was forced to halt production with TSMC in 2020 when the Bureau of Industry and Security ( BIS ) at the U.S. Department of Commerce placed Huawei on the Entity List and imposed the Foreign Direct Product Rule ( FDPR ) on the company . This extraterritorial control effectively prohibited foreign foundries from manufacturing Huawei ’ s chips , kneecapping Huawei ’ s ability to produce its Ascend 910 chips . Two years later , Huawei began selling a second generation of Ascend 910 chips—called the Ascend 910B series—which are fabricated domestically in mainland China . 3 Due to Huawei ’ s close collaboration with Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation ( SMIC ) , these chips appear to be among the select few to use China ’ s most advanced but highly limited 7nm fabrication capacity . Comparing the two generations of Ascend 910 chips provides insights into how Huawei is designing and manufacturing around U.S. export controls , in particular the FDPR , to supply the Chinese market with high-performance AI chips . 4 To inform this analysis , we reviewed technical documentation for both generations of Ascend 910 chips and technical documentation for over 20 server products that incorporate those chips . While both generations of the Ascend 910 chips are similarly designed , a few key differences are worth noting . The second-generation Ascend 910B chips have higher maximum performance , a higher clock speed but fewer active AI cores , one additional vector unit in each AI core , and a newer memory type with higher bandwidth and capacity . Huawei created five models of the first-generation Ascend 910 chip , the highest performing of which appears to be capable of 320 FP16 TFLOPS . To put this in context , this is roughly comparable to NVIDIA ’ s A100 , which was state-of-the-art in 2020 . 5 Ascend 910 models range from 30-32 active AI cores . Each AI core contains one matrix execution unit and one vector execution unit ; both types of units are needed to train AI models , but most of the core ’ s performance comes from the matrix unit , which is specially designed for AI operations . The second-generation 910B series , likely released in 2022 , has at least four models . The highest performing of these four models appears to be capable of 400 FP16 TFLOPS . All four models have fewer active AI cores , ranging from 20-25 . A key difference between the two generations is that each AI core of the second generation contains one matrix execution unit and two vector execution units—one more vector unit than the previous generation . Huawei likely added a second vector unit because the sole vector unit may have had insufficient throughput , becoming a bottleneck for the matrix unit . 6 With an additional vector unit the second-generation Ascend 910B likely can more quickly perform vector operations , which may increase overall AI training and speed . Additionally , compared with the first-generation series , the 910B has twice as much on-chip memory , which should relieve memory bottlenecks and help the chip ’ s actual performance approach its theoretical maximum . The 910B also features a newer external memory type ( HBM2e ) with higher bandwidth and double the maximum memory capacity . See Table 1 for a direct comparison between the first- and second-generation Ascend 910 chips . Huawei also created the Ascend 910C series , which likely was intended to double the performance of the 910B series by doubling the number of active AI cores . However , potentially due to manufacturing issues , Huawei ultimately reduced the specifications for the 910C series to match those of the 910B . 7 Table 1 : Key Specifications for First- and Second-Generation Ascend 910 Series Chips 8 The increase in theoretical maximum performance from the first-generation Ascend 910 ( 320 TFLOPS ) to the second-generation Ascend 910B ( 400 TFLOPS ) is a significant upgrade . However , a deeper analysis reveals that the performance difference between the first- and second-generation chips is lower than it appears . In general , a chip ’ s performance is calculated by multiplying the clock speed ( i.e. , the number of cycles a chip can perform per second ) and the throughput of the chip ( i.e. , the number of operations a chip can perform per cycle ) . Based on CSET analysis , there are three factors responsible for the 80 TFLOPS increase in theoretical performance from the first-generation to the second-generation Ascend 910B chips . Half of the increase ( 40 TFLOPS ) comes as a result of the second-generation Ascend 910B being clocked at a higher speed . Increasing the clock speed means that a chip is able to cycle more times per second , which increases the speed of operation and leads to overall higher performance . Per cycle , the two generations have nearly identical throughput aside from an additional vector unit per core and an accounting change , which are responsible for the remaining increase in performance . More specifically , about a fourth ( 20 TFLOPS ) of the increase can be attributed to the additional vector unit per core incorporated in the 910B . The remaining fourth ( 20 TFLOPS ) comes as a result of an accounting change in how Huawei calculated the chips ’ performance . Figure 1 . Factors Responsible for the Increase in TFLOPS Between Ascend 910 and Ascend 910B 9 Between the first- and second-generation Ascend 910 chips , Huawei changed which operations it counted towards performance . Even though the first generation appears able to run matrix and vector operations in parallel , Huawei only counted operations performed by matrix units towards the chip ’ s peak performance—excluding operations performed by the vector units . 10 For the second generation , however , Huawei counted operations from both the matrix and vector units . If we applied the same accounting method to the first-generation Ascend 910 chip ( i.e. , counting both matrix and vector units towards performance ) , it would have a maximum theoretical performance of 340 TFLOPS . As a result , the real improvement in maximum theoretical performance is only 60 TFLOPS rather than 80 TFLOPS . As explained above , the second-generation 910B series uses significantly fewer active AI cores than the first-generation 910 series , suggesting yield or capacity constraints on SMIC ’ s manufacturing process . There are two likely reasons why the second-generation 910B has fewer AI cores . The first possibility is that both generations use 32 total AI cores , but because the yields of SMIC ’ s 7nm process are low , only 20-25 cores could be activated per 910B series chip . The second possibility is that Huawei made a die with fewer total AI cores , allowing Huawei to fabricate more chips per wafer using SMIC ’ s limited 7nm fabrication capacity . This could also be an effort to offset the likely die area increase resulting from adding more on-chip memory to the chip . 11 Whether due to SMIC ’ s poor yields or limited capacity , Huawei reduced the number of active AI cores between the 910 and 910B—successfully designing a chip that could be manufactured domestically at SMIC and supplied to the Chinese market . But to accomplish this , Huawei needed at least two years—from when the FDPR was applied in 2020 to when the 910B series first appeared in technical documentation in 2022—to redesign and domestically fabricate the chip . Meanwhile , since 2020 , leading U.S. AI chip design companies designed and produced new chips capable of performance that surpasses any Huawei Ascend chip . 12 Huawei ’ s Ascend 910 and 910B chips are both consequential innovations . The first-generation 910 demonstrated that Huawei was a fast follower in AI chip design ; Huawei unveiled the 910 before NVIDIA ’ s A100—claiming similar performance on paper but falling short in practice . Then , in 2022 , despite extraterritorial U.S. export controls , Huawei produced the second-generation Ascend 910B chip with improved performance and memory—a true Chinese-made alternative to NVIDIA ’ s now-restricted A100 . Today , the 910B is available through Huawei ’ s own cloud services and has been purchased by Chinese companies , including Baidu , Tencent , and iFLYTEK . The chip ’ s performance and ( albeit limited ) commercial success demonstrate how Huawei is already producing the exact type of chip that U.S. export controls intend to restrict China from obtaining . Nonetheless , Huawei ’ s production capacity and technology leadership are both constrained by serious limitations . Huawei faces numerous challenges in meeting the demands of the Chinese market with its most advanced AI chips , primarily because of manufacturing constraints . SMIC ’ s yield rates and cost efficiency appear to be low , making this an expensive endeavor for Huawei , SMIC , and their government backers . Additionally , SMIC ’ s 7nm production capacity remains limited , forcing Huawei to decide between manufacturing its most advanced smartphone chips ( i.e. , the Kirin 9000S ) or its AI chips . These challenges will likely continue to limit China ’ s access to advanced AI chips , at least in the short term , until SMIC is able to improve yields and bring more production capacity online . The 910B demonstrates that Huawei is continuing to innovate under export controls but is falling behind . The Ascend 910B is only an incremental improvement over the first-generation 910 . In a fast-moving technology space where the industry leaders have tripled chip performance between recent generations , the 910B ’ s performance is only 1.2 times that of the first-generation 910 . 13 The future of Huawei ’ s leadership in AI chip technology will depend on whether the company can make consistent , transformative design and packaging innovations to compensate for the manufacturing improvements denied to China by U.S. export controls .

US,www.rand.org,news,Commentary,Leashing Chinese AI Needs Smart Chip Controls,"RAND's divisions conduct research on a uniquely broad front for clients around the globe. Commentary Aug 7, 2025 Employees work on a semiconductor production line in Nanchong, Sichuan Province, China, April 7, 2025 Photo by Li Tao/VCG/Reuters By Kyle Chan and Ray Wang This commentary was originally published by Foreign Policy on August 4, 2025. China's stunning achievements in AI have one glaring weak spot: access to compute—the raw processing power that fuels AI and relies on large volumes of advanced semiconductors. The United States currently has a tenfold advantage over China in total compute capacity, a gap that may only widen over time. U.S. tech firms are pouring billions of dollars into new data centers and can reap the benefits of the latest chip advancements from Nvidia and AMD or their own self-developed AI chips. Meanwhile, the performance and volume of foreign AI chips that Chinese firms can obtain have gone down over time due to increasingly stringent U.S. export controls. Chinese tech leaders such as Tencent , Baidu , and DeepSeek have called out compute constraints as a key bottleneck to faster AI development. Huawei's domestically produced AI chips, known as the Ascend series, might seem like the obvious solution to China's compute challenges. But there's a catch: Chinese tech firms don't want to use Huawei's chips, which lag behind their foreign counterparts, for training their AI models. In 2024, Chinese companies bought around 1 million Nvidia H20 chips compared with an estimated shipment of 450,000 Huawei Ascend 910B chips. Only a handful of state-backed companies in China have used Huawei chips to train their models, including iFlytek , SenseTime , and China Mobile. Chinese companies are dragging their feet on switching to domestic AI chips despite pressure from Chinese central government agencies to do so. Chinese AI developers overwhelmingly prefer using Nvidia chips—even severely performance-degraded ones—and go to great lengths to access them. Many of China's top AI models today are still trained on Nvidia's hardware, including DeepSeek's V3 model and Moonshot's Kimi K2 model ( PDF ) . In anticipation of the U.S. ban on Nvidia's H20 chips, ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent rushed to spend $16 billion to stockpile roughly 1.3 million to 1.6 million H20 units. At the end of 2024, ByteDance had planned to spend $7 billion to access Nvidia chips on servers outside of China. Chinese tech companies have been scouring black markets across Asia as well as e-commerce sites to acquire banned Nvidia chips for as much as double their normal price . Chinese buyers have even resorted to buying Nvidia's RTX gaming chips as substitutes, even though they are not designed for AI workloads, and smuggling hard drives full of data out of the country to train models on servers outside of China. Chinese tech firms don't want to use Huawei's chips, which lag behind their foreign counterparts, for training their AI models. Why are China's AI developers so reluctant to switch from Nvidia to Huawei, even as their access to Nvidia chips becomes increasingly constrained? First, Nvidia's degraded chips for sale to China still outperform Huawei's chips in some important dimensions. Huawei's Ascend 910B chips use older HBM2E memory technology, offering only two-thirds of the memory capacity and 40 percent of the bandwidth of Nvidia's H20 chips. Huawei's newer Ascend 910C chips , which are ramping up production this year, offer 80 percent of the H20's bandwidth but still use the older HBM2E memory standard that is two generations behind the most advanced AI chips. This gap in memory performance is particularly important given the rise of reasoning models and inference, where memory bandwidth plays a vital role. A second key reason why Chinese tech companies can't easily quit Nvidia is the same reason American tech companies can't, either: CUDA . Nvidia's parallel computing platform, launched in 2006, has accumulated users and is tightly integrated with PyTorch, the dominant AI framework, creating a mature software ecosystem that locks developers into Nvidia's AI systems. For Chinese tech firms, switching away from Nvidia means rewriting code, abandoning this industry-leading infrastructure, and losing access to the applications in CUDA libraries built up over years by global developers. Huawei's alternatives—its CANN platform and MindSpore framework, launched in 2018 and 2019 —are newer, less mature, and plagued by technical issues including bugs , crashes, and overheating . With a far smaller AI hardware user base than Nvidia's systems, Huawei lacks the high-volume, real-world feedback from major customers needed to rapidly refine its chips and software. As a result, Huawei's AI solutions are unable to take advantage of the kind of iterative optimization that made China a global leader in other industries. While access to Nvidia chips is becoming increasingly difficult, the supply of Huawei's chips remains both constrained and uncertain. U.S.-led export controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China have limited the country's chipmaking capabilities. In particular, Huawei and SMIC have been struggling to ramp up production of advanced chips at the 7-nanometer process level or below. A lack of access to extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines from ASML and U.S. tools for key tasks such as etching and deposition have made it difficult for SMIC to manufacture advanced chips precisely and reliably , keeping its production yield far below industry leader TSMC. While SMIC is making steady progress and Huawei is on track to sell over a million Ascend dies this year, Huawei also illegally procured more than 2 million of TSMC's logic dies, a core chip component, for its Ascend 910B and 910C chips in 2024. Ironically, because Huawei is already heavily sanctioned, it faces little punishment for skirting export controls in this way. Chinese companies are also wary of the additional commercial and geopolitical risks involved with Huawei, which has been a frequent target of the U.S. government for years. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce warned in May that using Huawei chips “anywhere in the world” would violate U.S. export control rules before later adjusting its announcement. Huawei is not only a chip supplier to Chinese tech companies but also a powerful competitor. Huawei is China's second-largest cloud service provider and has developed its own open-source Pangu family of AI models. Other Chinese tech companies are jostling with Huawei to provide cloud services not just within China but globally as well —making Huawei's chips an unpopular option for firms competing in the same space. However, this could all change if the United States makes the wrong decisions. While Huawei's chips have lower bandwidth memory performance than Nvidia's H20 chips, Huawei's 910B and 910C chips already offer greater total processing performance (TPP) and better energy efficiency (TPP/watt) than the H20. Far from being a “powerful chip” as some have claimed, the H20 actually has worse computational performance and energy efficiency than Nvidia's older A100 chips, launched back in 2020. Moreover, Huawei has been able to improve the computational performance of its Ascend chips, even after switching production from Taiwanese chip manufacturer TSMC to China's own SMIC following U.S. export controls. Perhaps more importantly, Huawei has been making significant progress at the level of AI computing systems. Huawei recently unveiled its CloudMatrix 384 system , made up of 384 of Huawei's latest 910C chips and a novel all-optical networking approach. According to SemiAnalysis , Huawei's new CloudMatrix system outperforms Nvidia's state-of-the-art GB200 NVL72 system on key dimensions, such as compute power (how fast the chip can process large volumes of data), memory bandwidth, and integrated networking. While Huawei's new system is a lot more costly and energy intensive than Nvidia's counterpart, which may limit customer adoption, it marks a striking advancement in system-level performance, which may be even more important than individual chip performance for scaling up large AI compute clusters. In a recent technical paper ( PDF ) , Huawei has already proven that its new CloudMatrix system can be successfully used to train advanced AI models. The pricing and energy issues will likely be manageable for Huawei as it continues to invest heavily in R&D and receive significant state support. As Huawei's AI systems continue to improve, U.S. export control policies must be carefully calibrated to avoid pushing China's AI industry too far. If China's domestic AI chips continue to improve, while U.S. chips available in China are further downgraded by export controls, there will be a crossover point where the performance of Chinese chips clearly exceeds that of American chips available in China. The crucial tipping point could be if China's largest tech companies, such as Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance, throw their formidable resources toward working with Chinese AI chipmakers. This would kick off a positive feedback loop for China's AI chipmakers, particularly Huawei, building up the software libraries and tools for creating a complete Chinese AI hardware-software ecosystem. Once this process is underway, it would also mark a point of no return for American AI chipmakers like Nvidia in the China market. There are already some signs of this potential shift. DeepSeek and ByteDance are experimenting with using Huawei's AI chips to run their AI models. Ant Group , a spinoff of Alibaba, is even testing the use of Huawei's chips for model training. Huawei's Ascend developer community has grown nearly tenfold in the past four years, though it still remains far smaller than Nvidia's. Other Chinese AI chipmakers besides Huawei are making progress as well, including Cambricon, Biren, Moore Threads, Enflame, and Hygon. Cambricon saw its first-quarter revenue surge more than forty-fold last year and received a large order for its AI chips from ByteDance , Cambricon's revenue is forecasted to grow 3.7 times to 5.5 billion yuan this year according to Goldman Sachs. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, has said that Nvidia's market share in China has declined from 95 percent to 50 percent—a claim supported by other credible analysis. The United States needs a more sophisticated approach to export controls. The reversal of the H20 chip ban by the Trump administration was a step in the right direction. At the same time, the White House's new AI action plan correctly recognizes that winning the AI race with China depends on making the U.S. tech stack, including its AI chips, the dominant platform for global AI development. As Huawei's AI systems continue to improve, U.S. export control policies must be carefully calibrated to avoid pushing China's AI industry too far. Semiconductor export controls are not as simple as tightening the valve on a tap. China's AI chip dilemma is not just a hardware problem but an ecosystem one. Huawei now has access to many of the key resources it needs to develop advanced AI chips, including financing and talent. But it's missing a large and dedicated customer base that is committed to co-refining the software and hardware Huawei offers. A smart approach to export controls would focus on setting a performance threshold for AI chips that can be sold to China based on a window between U.S. and Chinese hardware capabilities. The performance threshold should be high enough to outperform China's domestic hardware options to ensure Chinese developers remain on U.S. platforms. At the same time, it should be low enough to maintain a significant performance gap with hardware systems available to American developers. Ideally, this performance threshold would include a buffer, such as a 50 percent performance advantage over Chinese hardware systems on key metrics, in anticipation of improvements in Chinese hardware offerings. A regular yearly update, with ad hoc changes for unexpected developments, would likely be sufficient to adjust for advances made in Chinese AI chips while providing enough policy stability for industry participants. The overarching policy goal is clear: Ensure the United States continues to lead the world in AI. By constraining China's access to cutting-edge chips without pushing Chinese AI developers to make the leap to China's own domestic chips, the United States can use export controls to help make this a reality.

According to SemiAnalysis , Huawei's new CloudMatrix system outperforms Nvidia's state-of-the-art GB200 NVL72 system on key dimensions, such as compute power (how fast the chip can process large volumes of data), memory bandwidth, and integrated networking. While Huawei's new system is a lot more costly and energy intensive than Nvidia's counterpart, which may limit customer adoption, it marks a striking advancement in system-level performance, which may be even more important than individual chip performance for scaling up large AI compute clusters. In a recent technical paper ( PDF ) , Huawei has already proven that its new CloudMatrix system can be successfully used to train advanced AI models. The pricing and energy issues will likely be manageable for Huawei as it continues to invest heavily in R&D and receive significant state support. As Huawei's AI systems continue to improve, U.S. export control policies must be carefully calibrated to avoid pushing China's AI industry too far. If China's domestic AI chips continue to improve, while U.S. chips available in China are further downgraded by export controls, there will be a crossover point where the performance of Chinese chips clearly exceeds that of American chips available in China. The crucial tipping point could be if China's largest tech companies, such as Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance, throw their formidable resources toward working with Chinese AI chipmakers. This would kick off a positive feedback loop for China's AI chipmakers, particularly Huawei, building up the software libraries and tools for creating a complete Chinese AI hardware-software ecosystem. Once this process is underway, it would also mark a point of no return for American AI chipmakers like Nvidia in the China market. There are already some signs of this potential shift. DeepSeek and ByteDance are experimenting with using Huawei's AI chips to run their AI models. Ant Group , a spinoff of Alibaba, is even testing the use of Huawei's chips for model training. Huawei's Ascend developer community has grown nearly tenfold in the past four years, though it still remains far smaller than Nvidia's. Other Chinese AI chipmakers besides Huawei are making progress as well, including Cambricon, Biren, Moore Threads, Enflame, and Hygon. Cambricon saw its first-quarter revenue surge more than forty-fold last year and received a large order for its AI chips from ByteDance , Cambricon's revenue is forecasted to grow 3.7 times to 5.5 billion yuan this year according to Goldman Sachs. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, has said that Nvidia's market share in China has declined from 95 percent to 50 percent—a claim supported by other credible analysis. The United States needs a more sophisticated approach to export controls. The reversal of the H20 chip ban by the Trump administration was a step in the right direction. At the same time, the White House's new AI action plan correctly recognizes that winning the AI race with China depends on making the U.S. tech stack, including its AI chips, the dominant platform for global AI development. As Huawei's AI systems continue to improve, U.S. export control policies must be carefully calibrated to avoid pushing China's AI industry too far. Semiconductor export controls are not as simple as tightening the valve on a tap. China's AI chip dilemma is not just a hardware problem but an ecosystem one. Huawei now has access to many of the key resources it needs to develop advanced AI chips, including financing and talent. But it's missing a large and dedicated customer base that is committed to co-refining the software and hardware Huawei offers. A smart approach to export controls would focus on setting a performance threshold for AI chips that can be sold to China based on a window between U.S. and Chinese hardware capabilities. The performance threshold should be high enough to outperform China's domestic hardware options to ensure Chinese developers remain on U.S. platforms. At the same time, it should be low enough to maintain a significant performance gap with hardware systems available to American developers. Ideally, this performance threshold would include a buffer, such as a 50 percent performance advantage over Chinese hardware systems on key metrics, in anticipation of improvements in Chinese hardware offerings. A regular yearly update, with ad hoc changes for unexpected developments, would likely be sufficient to adjust for advances made in Chinese AI chips while providing enough policy stability for industry participants. The overarching policy goal is clear: Ensure the United States continues to lead the world in AI. By constraining China's access to cutting-edge chips without pushing Chinese AI developers to make the leap to China's own domestic chips, the United States can use export controls to help make this a reality.

Commentary Aug 7 , 2025 Employees work on a semiconductor production line in Nanchong , Sichuan Province , China , April 7 , 2025 Photo by Li Tao/VCG/Reuters By Kyle Chan and Ray Wang This commentary was originally published by Foreign Policy on August 4 , 2025 . China 's stunning achievements in AI have one glaring weak spot : access to compute—the raw processing power that fuels AI and relies on large volumes of advanced semiconductors . The United States currently has a tenfold advantage over China in total compute capacity , a gap that may only widen over time . U.S. tech firms are pouring billions of dollars into new data centers and can reap the benefits of the latest chip advancements from Nvidia and AMD or their own self-developed AI chips . Meanwhile , the performance and volume of foreign AI chips that Chinese firms can obtain have gone down over time due to increasingly stringent U.S. export controls . Chinese tech leaders such as Tencent , Baidu , and DeepSeek have called out compute constraints as a key bottleneck to faster AI development . Huawei 's domestically produced AI chips , known as the Ascend series , might seem like the obvious solution to China 's compute challenges . But there 's a catch : Chinese tech firms do n't want to use Huawei 's chips , which lag behind their foreign counterparts , for training their AI models . In 2024 , Chinese companies bought around 1 million Nvidia H20 chips compared with an estimated shipment of 450,000 Huawei Ascend 910B chips . Only a handful of state-backed companies in China have used Huawei chips to train their models , including iFlytek , SenseTime , and China Mobile . Chinese companies are dragging their feet on switching to domestic AI chips despite pressure from Chinese central government agencies to do so . Chinese AI developers overwhelmingly prefer using Nvidia chips—even severely performance-degraded ones—and go to great lengths to access them . Many of China 's top AI models today are still trained on Nvidia 's hardware , including DeepSeek 's V3 model and Moonshot 's Kimi K2 model ( PDF ) . In anticipation of the U.S. ban on Nvidia 's H20 chips , ByteDance , Alibaba , and Tencent rushed to spend $ 16 billion to stockpile roughly 1.3 million to 1.6 million H20 units . At the end of 2024 , ByteDance had planned to spend $ 7 billion to access Nvidia chips on servers outside of China . Chinese tech companies have been scouring black markets across Asia as well as e-commerce sites to acquire banned Nvidia chips for as much as double their normal price . Chinese buyers have even resorted to buying Nvidia 's RTX gaming chips as substitutes , even though they are not designed for AI workloads , and smuggling hard drives full of data out of the country to train models on servers outside of China . Chinese tech firms do n't want to use Huawei 's chips , which lag behind their foreign counterparts , for training their AI models . Why are China 's AI developers so reluctant to switch from Nvidia to Huawei , even as their access to Nvidia chips becomes increasingly constrained ? First , Nvidia 's degraded chips for sale to China still outperform Huawei 's chips in some important dimensions . Huawei 's Ascend 910B chips use older HBM2E memory technology , offering only two-thirds of the memory capacity and 40 percent of the bandwidth of Nvidia 's H20 chips . Huawei 's newer Ascend 910C chips , which are ramping up production this year , offer 80 percent of the H20 's bandwidth but still use the older HBM2E memory standard that is two generations behind the most advanced AI chips . This gap in memory performance is particularly important given the rise of reasoning models and inference , where memory bandwidth plays a vital role . A second key reason why Chinese tech companies ca n't easily quit Nvidia is the same reason American tech companies ca n't , either : CUDA . Nvidia 's parallel computing platform , launched in 2006 , has accumulated users and is tightly integrated with PyTorch , the dominant AI framework , creating a mature software ecosystem that locks developers into Nvidia 's AI systems . For Chinese tech firms , switching away from Nvidia means rewriting code , abandoning this industry-leading infrastructure , and losing access to the applications in CUDA libraries built up over years by global developers . Huawei 's alternatives—its CANN platform and MindSpore framework , launched in 2018 and 2019 —are newer , less mature , and plagued by technical issues including bugs , crashes , and overheating . With a far smaller AI hardware user base than Nvidia 's systems , Huawei lacks the high-volume , real-world feedback from major customers needed to rapidly refine its chips and software . As a result , Huawei 's AI solutions are unable to take advantage of the kind of iterative optimization that made China a global leader in other industries . While access to Nvidia chips is becoming increasingly difficult , the supply of Huawei 's chips remains both constrained and uncertain . U.S.-led export controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China have limited the country 's chipmaking capabilities . In particular , Huawei and SMIC have been struggling to ramp up production of advanced chips at the 7-nanometer process level or below . A lack of access to extreme ultraviolet lithography ( EUV ) machines from ASML and U.S. tools for key tasks such as etching and deposition have made it difficult for SMIC to manufacture advanced chips precisely and reliably , keeping its production yield far below industry leader TSMC . While SMIC is making steady progress and Huawei is on track to sell over a million Ascend dies this year , Huawei also illegally procured more than 2 million of TSMC 's logic dies , a core chip component , for its Ascend 910B and 910C chips in 2024 . Ironically , because Huawei is already heavily sanctioned , it faces little punishment for skirting export controls in this way . Chinese companies are also wary of the additional commercial and geopolitical risks involved with Huawei , which has been a frequent target of the U.S. government for years . For example , the U.S. Department of Commerce warned in May that using Huawei chips “ anywhere in the world ” would violate U.S. export control rules before later adjusting its announcement . Huawei is not only a chip supplier to Chinese tech companies but also a powerful competitor . Huawei is China 's second-largest cloud service provider and has developed its own open-source Pangu family of AI models . Other Chinese tech companies are jostling with Huawei to provide cloud services not just within China but globally as well —making Huawei 's chips an unpopular option for firms competing in the same space . However , this could all change if the United States makes the wrong decisions . While Huawei 's chips have lower bandwidth memory performance than Nvidia 's H20 chips , Huawei 's 910B and 910C chips already offer greater total processing performance ( TPP ) and better energy efficiency ( TPP/watt ) than the H20 . Far from being a “ powerful chip ” as some have claimed , the H20 actually has worse computational performance and energy efficiency than Nvidia 's older A100 chips , launched back in 2020 . Moreover , Huawei has been able to improve the computational performance of its Ascend chips , even after switching production from Taiwanese chip manufacturer TSMC to China 's own SMIC following U.S. export controls . Perhaps more importantly , Huawei has been making significant progress at the level of AI computing systems . Huawei recently unveiled its CloudMatrix 384 system , made up of 384 of Huawei 's latest 910C chips and a novel all-optical networking approach . According to SemiAnalysis , Huawei 's new CloudMatrix system outperforms Nvidia 's state-of-the-art GB200 NVL72 system on key dimensions , such as compute power ( how fast the chip can process large volumes of data ) , memory bandwidth , and integrated networking .

US,cepa.org,news,2025-08-19T15:25:13+00:00,Chip Challenge: Goodbye Export Controls,"It’s a significant shift. Under President Joseph Biden, the US banned the sale of most advanced AI chips to China, declaring them a national security risk. President Donald Trump has lifted the ban on the condition that US chipmakers pay the US government 15% of the proceeds. The reversal represents a clear-eyed realization that export controls are failing to achieve their goal of keeping China down, CEPA tech fellows say. While the new policy appears free-market on the surface, it also signaled unprecedented state intervention in the semiconductor business. Christopher Cytera Export controls are ineffective in the medium-term, and counter-productive in the long run. This ultimately accelerates the independence of the target country, which often finds a better way to engineer the product anyway. It already happened in telephone markets. Recall how China’s Huawei developed polar codes for 5G by itself, without stealing IP, but by getting the right academics on its books and launching a development program backed by massive state-backed investment. The 15% “license” is an export tariff to make it more expensive for China Inc. to buy NVIDIA and AMD chips. China Inc. will develop these chips themselves anyway, so why not pocket some revenue for the US taxpayer while they do so? The revenue could be invested in strategic sectors for the US electronics industry, such as defense, or sectors where China is ahead, such as drones, electric vehicles, and greentech chips. Christopher Cytera is a Non-resident senior fellow with the Digital Innovation Initiative at the Center for European Policy Analysis and a technology business executive with over 30 years of experience in semiconductors, electronics, communications, video, and imaging. Elly Rostoum On the surface, these developments epitomize Trump’s laissez-faire, free-market approach, and that the payback deal is quintessentially “deal making.” But the consequences overturn US policy and encourage Europe to re-orient China. This new “15% for a license” model doesn’t just weaken US export controls — it guts their original strategic purpose, as well as the very grand strategy the US was pursuing to contain China’s rise technologically. By turning security-based restrictions into something you can simply pay to bypass, Washington has effectively thrown both the de-risking and decoupling playbooks out the window. You’d have to go back to the era of European colonial oil concessions to find a comparable arrangement to this “15% cut for a license” deal. In the early 20th century, oil companies — backed by their colonial powers — secured long-term concession leases in places like Iraq and Iran by paying their home governments and appointed representatives a share of royalties. The parallel is striking: just as colonial powers traded resource rights for financial windfall, the US is now trading national security leverage for a steady cash flow from chip sales. The message to Europe, especially to the Dutch government and ASML, is clear: you’re on your own. If the US is willing to monetize export licenses, why should Europeans forgo sales of lithography machines to China? This incentivizes them to deal directly with Beijing, eroding the collective pressure needed to “corner” China technologically.

You can find out more about her work here: www.EllyRostoum.com Matthew Eitel The NVIDIA/AMD revenue-sharing deal, while a sea change for US export controls policy, is not necessarily surprising. Between the AI Action Plan , Middle East chip deals , and scrapping the Biden-era Diffusion Rule , the second Trump White House is so far executing a clear vision — albeit one that is ruffling the feathers of DC China Hawks. The Trump Administration’s theory of victory for beating China in the AI race is clear: encourage the export of US AI technology, both software and hardware, to cement US tech as the global standard. The more US AI chips sold to China — even those debatably “older” like the H20 — the argument goes, the less Chinese firms will want to use lower quality domestically produced chips, increasing revenue for US firms while keeping China’s AI industry addicted to American tech. This strategy is striking a nerve in Beijing. Communist Party authorities are having a hard time convincing Chinese AI firms to not use US chips. Issues with Huawei-produced chips forced DeepSeek to delay the launch of its latest AI model. Now Chinese authorities are accusing the US government of embedding tracking devices on NVIDIA chips — potentially leading to a ban on Chinese firms using the chips. The deal is less about the death of export controls and more about the creation of a new policy lever for the Trump administration to demand US firms more closely align with its political priorities. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is weighing applying this “ beta test ” to other industries. Many will point to export taxes being unconstitutional in hope that this deal is not precedent setting. But it remains unclear whether anyone but NVIDIA/AMD have grounds to challenge in court, and neither firm has an incentive to bring said challenge. Alongside reported discussions of the US government taking a stake in Intel, it is clear that Trump 2.0 and China increasingly agree on a more heavy-handed role for the state to guide their competition. As then-Senator JD Vance puts it , “there is no meaningful distinction between the public and the private sector in the American regime.” Matthew Eitel is Chief of Staff at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA). His work is focused on the nexus of EU-US tech, trade, and national security, particularly export controls and transatlantic policy vis-à-vis China. Δ William Echikson The Biden Administration trumpeted industrial policy. Its Chips and Science Act poured billions of dollars into semiconductor and electric vehicle subsidies. The Trump Administration is abandoning these policies — but intervening just as much or more in the free market, particularly with semiconductors. Chipmakers court the president to win permission to sell to China, with a chunk of proceeds going to the government. What will come next? After berating and making peace with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, Trump may have the government take a stake in the US flagship chip manufacturer — or force US chip designers to give Intel business at the expense of industry-leading Taiwan Semiconductor TSMC. Beware: this isn’t a recipe for tech success. It’s a recipe for falling behind, directing companies to potentially buy overpriced, underperforming services. Just like Europe risks falling into a similar digital sovereignty trap of insisting on European tech, the US must resist the temptation of insisting on US tech. Semiconductors and artificial intelligence are globalized industries — and attempts to institute national preferences represent a step backwards for competitiveness. William Echikson is a Non-resident Senior Fellow with the Tech Policy Program and editor of the online tech policy journal Bandwidth at the Center for European Policy Analysis. Jack Galloway Relaxed export controls, the opening of the Chinese market, and a zero-for-zero tariff on European semiconductor equipment will create significant growth opportunities for Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML. The Dutch company represents a critical chokepoint in the global semiconductor and artificial intelligence supply chain. It remains the sole manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet lithography machines used to fabricate sub 7nm chips critical for AI data centers springing up across the globe. Under the Biden Administration, ASML faced strong pressure to not sell EUV equipment to China. While it remains unlikely that the Trump administration will revoke these direct EUV sale restrictions, increased market access and surging capital investment in data centers will spur further demand for ASML EUV machines. Even if American firms in the AI tech stack continue to reshore portions of semiconductor production, they will still need ASML’s lithography equipment.

Christopher Cytera Export controls are ineffective in the medium-term , and counter-productive in the long run . This ultimately accelerates the independence of the target country , which often finds a better way to engineer the product anyway . It already happened in telephone markets . Recall how China ’ s Huawei developed polar codes for 5G by itself , without stealing IP , but by getting the right academics on its books and launching a development program backed by massive state-backed investment . The 15 % “ license ” is an export tariff to make it more expensive for China Inc. to buy NVIDIA and AMD chips . China Inc. will develop these chips themselves anyway , so why not pocket some revenue for the US taxpayer while they do so ? The revenue could be invested in strategic sectors for the US electronics industry , such as defense , or sectors where China is ahead , such as drones , electric vehicles , and greentech chips . Christopher Cytera is a Non-resident senior fellow with the Digital Innovation Initiative at the Center for European Policy Analysis and a technology business executive with over 30 years of experience in semiconductors , electronics , communications , video , and imaging . Elly Rostoum On the surface , these developments epitomize Trump ’ s laissez-faire , free-market approach , and that the payback deal is quintessentially “ deal making. ” But the consequences overturn US policy and encourage Europe to re-orient China . This new “ 15 % for a license ” model doesn ’ t just weaken US export controls — it guts their original strategic purpose , as well as the very grand strategy the US was pursuing to contain China ’ s rise technologically . By turning security-based restrictions into something you can simply pay to bypass , Washington has effectively thrown both the de-risking and decoupling playbooks out the window . You ’ d have to go back to the era of European colonial oil concessions to find a comparable arrangement to this “ 15 % cut for a license ” deal . In the early 20th century , oil companies — backed by their colonial powers — secured long-term concession leases in places like Iraq and Iran by paying their home governments and appointed representatives a share of royalties . The parallel is striking : just as colonial powers traded resource rights for financial windfall , the US is now trading national security leverage for a steady cash flow from chip sales . The message to Europe , especially to the Dutch government and ASML , is clear : you ’ re on your own . If the US is willing to monetize export licenses , why should Europeans forgo sales of lithography machines to China ? This incentivizes them to deal directly with Beijing , eroding the collective pressure needed to “ corner ” China technologically .

You can find out more about her work here : www.EllyRostoum.com Matthew Eitel The NVIDIA/AMD revenue-sharing deal , while a sea change for US export controls policy , is not necessarily surprising . Between the AI Action Plan , Middle East chip deals , and scrapping the Biden-era Diffusion Rule , the second Trump White House is so far executing a clear vision — albeit one that is ruffling the feathers of DC China Hawks . The Trump Administration ’ s theory of victory for beating China in the AI race is clear : encourage the export of US AI technology , both software and hardware , to cement US tech as the global standard . The more US AI chips sold to China — even those debatably “ older ” like the H20 — the argument goes , the less Chinese firms will want to use lower quality domestically produced chips , increasing revenue for US firms while keeping China ’ s AI industry addicted to American tech . This strategy is striking a nerve in Beijing . Communist Party authorities are having a hard time convincing Chinese AI firms to not use US chips . Issues with Huawei-produced chips forced DeepSeek to delay the launch of its latest AI model . Now Chinese authorities are accusing the US government of embedding tracking devices on NVIDIA chips — potentially leading to a ban on Chinese firms using the chips . The deal is less about the death of export controls and more about the creation of a new policy lever for the Trump administration to demand US firms more closely align with its political priorities . US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is weighing applying this “ beta test ” to other industries . Many will point to export taxes being unconstitutional in hope that this deal is not precedent setting . But it remains unclear whether anyone but NVIDIA/AMD have grounds to challenge in court , and neither firm has an incentive to bring said challenge . Alongside reported discussions of the US government taking a stake in Intel , it is clear that Trump 2.0 and China increasingly agree on a more heavy-handed role for the state to guide their competition . As then-Senator JD Vance puts it , “ there is no meaningful distinction between the public and the private sector in the American regime. ” Matthew Eitel is Chief of Staff at the Center for European Policy Analysis ( CEPA ) . His work is focused on the nexus of EU-US tech , trade , and national security , particularly export controls and transatlantic policy vis-à-vis China . Δ William Echikson The Biden Administration trumpeted industrial policy . Its Chips and Science Act poured billions of dollars into semiconductor and electric vehicle subsidies . The Trump Administration is abandoning these policies — but intervening just as much or more in the free market , particularly with semiconductors . Chipmakers court the president to win permission to sell to China , with a chunk of proceeds going to the government . What will come next ? After berating and making peace with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan , Trump may have the government take a stake in the US flagship chip manufacturer — or force US chip designers to give Intel business at the expense of industry-leading Taiwan Semiconductor TSMC . Beware : this isn ’ t a recipe for tech success . It ’ s a recipe for falling behind , directing companies to potentially buy overpriced , underperforming services . Just like Europe risks falling into a similar digital sovereignty trap of insisting on European tech , the US must resist the temptation of insisting on US tech . Semiconductors and artificial intelligence are globalized industries — and attempts to institute national preferences represent a step backwards for competitiveness . William Echikson is a Non-resident Senior Fellow with the Tech Policy Program and editor of the online tech policy journal Bandwidth at the Center for European Policy Analysis . Jack Galloway Relaxed export controls , the opening of the Chinese market , and a zero-for-zero tariff on European semiconductor equipment will create significant growth opportunities for Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML . The Dutch company represents a critical chokepoint in the global semiconductor and artificial intelligence supply chain . It remains the sole manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet lithography machines used to fabricate sub 7nm chips critical for AI data centers springing up across the globe . Under the Biden Administration , ASML faced strong pressure to not sell EUV equipment to China . While it remains unlikely that the Trump administration will revoke these direct EUV sale restrictions , increased market access and surging capital investment in data centers will spur further demand for ASML EUV machines . Even if American firms in the AI tech stack continue to reshore portions of semiconductor production , they will still need ASML ’ s lithography equipment .

Have these controls achieved their goals? Have the assumptions driving them been confirmed or undermined by the rapid evolution of the chip industry and AI capabilities?Â Three factors for assessing chip export controls. We can now draw preliminary conclusions by assessing three factors: Chinaâs domestic chipmaking capability, the sophistication of its AI models, and its market share in providing AI infrastructure. Initial evidence shows that controls have succeeded in several important ways, though not all. Restrictions on chipmaking tool sales have significantly slowed the growth of Chinaâs chipmaking capability. However, restrictions on the export of AI chips to China, while creating challenges, have not prevented Chinese labs from producing highly competitive models (though they may make it harder for China to deploy their models at scale). Controls have severely limited Chinaâs share of the global AI infrastructure market, because, lacking competitive hardware, Chinese cloud computing firms have been unable to establish much, if any, AI infrastructure outside of China. To understand these effects, itâs useful to briefly review the structure and evolution of the export control regime. Escalated export controls began by prohibiting the sale of equipment essential for chip manufacturing. The US has had export controls on semiconductors and chipmaking equipment for decades, but the current phase of escalated controls on China began in 2018, when the US started encouraging the Netherlands to restrict sales of the most advanced extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography tools to Chinaâs leading chipmaker, the partially state-owned Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC).Â EUVs are produced by a single company â the Netherlandsâ ASML â and cost over $100 million each. Only a handful of companies have acquired these tools. Barring US pressure and the Dutch decision to block the sale, China would have acquired its first tool in 2019, and it would likely have acquired many more since then. The US strategy for containing China has shifted toward an explicit focus on AI. The blocked EUV sale was part of a US campaign to keep China technologically behind the US. This campaign ratcheted up in October 2022, shifting from broad containment to an explicit focus on constraining Chinaâs AI industry. That shift reflected a growing awareness within the US government of how AI progress increasingly depended on access to the computational (âcomputeâ) hardware required to train AI models. US government officials had been closely tracking trends in AI, including the central role of âscaling lawsâ â the prediction, based on empirical observations, that AI capabilities are improved by larger training runs. If these scaling laws held, access to the most advanced semiconductors would be an important precondition for developing and deploying AI at scale. The October 2022 controls thus sought to limit Chinaâs access to chipmaking tools and AI chips themselves, which at the time were made mostly by US firms like Nvidia. Shortly after, Japan and the Netherlands â the two other countries that produce advanced chipmaking tools â imposed controls similar to those US export restrictions. Taiwan and South Korea, which have high-end chip-manufacturing capabilities, have also enforced control rules (with loopholes, discussed below). The US has since tightened controls even further, through several rounds of new restrictions on the transfer of tools and chips to China. To understand the impact of these restrictions on Chinaâs chipmaking capabilities, we have to consider the counterfactual: how much progress would China have made in the absence of export controls? SMIC could have become the second-largest producer of advanced AI chips. We know that SMIC would have acquired at least one EUV tool in 2019, had it not been blocked from doing so. Had that sale gone through, SMIC would probably have bought many more. Chinaâs government, in turn, would likely have moved to support the entry of SMIC into the industry by ramping up public investment. In this scenario, SMIC would likely have become a far larger producer of advanced AI chips than South Koreaâs Samsung, Americaâs Intel, and any other firm, except for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). The emergence of SMIC as a major player in advanced chip production would likely have led Western firms to invest less, on the rational conclusion that SMIC would drive down the profitability of competing investments. This same dynamic has played out in the market for less-advanced foundational semiconductors in recent years, where Chinaâs access to relevant chipmaking tools has not been restricted.Â Export controls have had knock-on effects on other Chinese technological capabilities. Access to high-end tools would also have supercharged Chinaâs capabilities to produce high-bandwidth memory chips, which must be paired with AI processors for efficient training and inference: the process of running a trained model to generate outputs in real-world applications. While Chinaâs leading firm in this sphere, ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT), has faced somewhat weaker restrictions than SMIC, which produces processors for Huawei, it has still been banned from acquiring EUV tools and other types of advanced tools that are useful in efficient memory chip manufacturing. Today, most of the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips paired with Huaweiâs AI processors are either purchased or smuggled from abroad. Better access to advanced tools would have improved CXMTâs pathway to producing cutting-edge HBM.Â Export controls have made China a marginal producer of AI chips. Setting aside the counterfactual, let's consider the actual impact of export controls since 2018: restricted access to chipmaking tools has severely hindered Chinaâs industry. The result is that China remains a marginal producer of AI chips. According to recent congressional testimony by US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Huawei will produce only 200,000 AI chips in 2025. By contrast, in 2024, China reportedly legally imported around 1 million chips that Nvidia had downgraded specifically for the Chinese market. Chinese companies must resort to smuggling. This inability to produce large volumes of advanced chips domestically explains why Huawei and other Chinese companies have resorted to large-scale smuggling. While many of the specific smuggling schemes reported in the media involve relatively small numbers of chips, the prevalence of such anecdotes suggests that the volume of chips entering China via this route is significant. Whatâs more, Huawei worked with a shell company that, until 2024, illegally procured over 2 million chips from TSMC.Â In other words, Huaweiâs largest supplier of chips today is not Chinaâs domestic manufacturing capabilities but, instead, a shell company illegally sourcing chips from Taiwan. This is a dramatically different status quo from the counterfactual scenario, in which SMIC would be a close second to TSMC in advanced chip manufacturing.Â China is unlikely to catch up. For now, therefore, Chinaâs AI chip production capacity is far behind the Westâs. Its evolution relative to that of Western countries will depend on Chinese firmsâ ability to make do with second-best equipment; the level of future US controls, which could be tightened or loosened; and the rate of technological advance in the Western supply chain.Â Most estimates suggest that China is likely to increase its production capacity over the next few years. (Of course, TSMC will increase its capacity and develop even more capable manufacturing techniques, too.) Chinese models have advanced despite export controls. Chip export controls have clearly had a significant negative impact on Chinaâs ability to produce advanced chips. But have those hardware limitations hindered the capability of Chinese models? Perhaps surprisingly, the answer is: not really.Â Chinese firms like Alibaba and DeepSeek have produced impressive large language models that score highly on established benchmarks for assessing model quality. Other firms, like ByteDance (which owns TikTok), focus on training internal models to recommend videos that are more addictive; by all accounts, ByteDance has done this very effectively. It is true, of course, that Chinese entrepreneurs in the AI space often talk about the problems that AI chip export controls cause them. Liang Wenfeng, founder of DeepSeek, has publicly said on multiple occasions that his greatest single challenge is accessing chips. In a 2024 interview , he said, âMoney has never been the problem for us; bans on shipments of advanced chips are the problem.âÂ But, despite this frustration, the technical benchmarks suggest that Chinaâs AI models do not have a significant capability gap compared with US-produced models. In some ways, they have innovated to get around the limitations of not having high-end chips.Â It could be the case that, over the next year or two, the chip access gap between US and Chinese firms will grow. US firms will build far larger clusters and will therefore be able to train significantly better AI systems. However, the trend of the last three years suggests the opposite: that, according to benchmarks, US and Chinese model capabilities are fairly evenly matched.Â Export controls may have limited Chinaâs ability to deploy AI. While chip restrictions havenât significantly limited Chinaâs ability to train cutting-edge models, they may have impacted Chinese firmsâ ability to deploy their models at scale. After the release of its R1 model earlier this year, DeepSeek had to restrict access to its API, presumably because it couldnât provide enough inference compute to meet user demand. That interpretation is supported by remarks from Tencent Cloud senior executive Wang Qi, who earlier this year suggested that deficits of advanced chips could slow AI adoption by limiting inference availability or driving up costs. Thus far, however, it isnât clear that chip deficits are delaying AI uptake in China. Puzzlingly, utilization in many of Chinaâs data centers appears to be relatively low, with media reports suggesting that up to 80% of Chinaâs AI chips may be unused. Many of China's medium-sized data centers appear to lack the stability to serve AI models at scale. This dynamic may be driven in part by heavy investment from state-owned telecoms and other state-owned firms, which have often managed these facilities very poorly.Â Export controls may have driven Chinese firms to buy chips they didnât need. Another intriguing possibility is that the inefficiency of Chinese data centers has been exacerbated by chip export controls. If these controls signaled to Chinaâs leadership that AI data center capacity was important â and if that conclusion signaled to state-owned firms that they should buy AI chips â it is possible that the controls have contributed to low utilization rates by encouraging less capable Chinese firms to buy chips for political rather than market reasons. If so, this would be a counterintuitive mechanism for chip export controls to have had an impact â though evidence for this is weak. For now, despite some unanswered questions around uptake, we must conclude that chip export controls have not seriously slowed improvements in Chinese model quality. The last dimension along which to examine the impact of export controls is Chinaâs ability to provide AI infrastructure to the rest of the world: that is, the chips and servers inside AI data centers. Several factors have made US firms â primarily Nvidia â the default global provider of high-end chips around the world, including in China. The quality of the companyâs chips and the depth of its software ecosystem are key factors contributing to its strong market position. But export controls have also shaped the market.Â Chinese companies remain dependent on US AI chips. Restrictions on the sale of chipmaking equipment have done more than drastically limit Chinaâs domestic chipmaking capabilities. They have also helped to guarantee that, because Chinese alternatives are not available at scale, Chinese firms still want to buy large numbers of US chips (such as, until recently, H20s ). Had SMIC been able to buy advanced tools and ramp up its production, it might have been able to meet Chinese tech firmsâ chip demand by producing Huaweiâs Ascend GPUs. Today, it cannot produce at the scale required. Export controls have significantly impacted Chinaâs influence abroad. This dynamic has been even more pronounced outside of China. The limits on Huaweiâs ability to source AI chips have made it a negligible player in providing AI cloud computing capabilities outside of China. Today, there is just one data point â an announced deal to deploy 3,000 Ascend GPUs in Malaysia that was later retracted by the Malaysian government. Beyond that, global AI infrastructure outside China is overwhelmingly built on Western chips â a significant limit on Chinese power.Â Half a decade of intensified export controls has left China with lopsided areas of agency: it has developed AI models whose capabilities rival those of US firms, but its inability to match US chipmaking capabilities has left it more reliant on American hardware to train and deploy these models â even domestically. It has especially limited Chinaâs ability to deploy AI infrastructure abroad.Â Several key uncertainties will shape the future impact of these controls.Â Access to advanced chips will remain critical. Current trends suggest that access to advanced AI chips will be a critical factor in shaping the future of AI. The past six years of export controls on chips and chipmaking equipment have given the US a commanding position in AI hardware globally.Â There is no serious challenge to the US. For now, there is no serious Chinese alternative providing AI infrastructure to Southeast Asia, the Middle East, or other regions. Even China is still importing US AI chips. This control of essential hardware gives Washington outsized leverage in shaping a technology that will define the future.

Have these controls achieved their goals? Have the assumptions driving them been confirmed or undermined by the rapid evolution of the chip industry and AI capabilities?Â Three factors for assessing chip export controls. We can now draw preliminary conclusions by assessing three factors: Chinaâs domestic chipmaking capability, the sophistication of its AI models, and its market share in providing AI infrastructure. Initial evidence shows that controls have succeeded in several important ways, though not all. Restrictions on chipmaking tool sales have significantly slowed the growth of Chinaâs chipmaking capability. However, restrictions on the export of AI chips to China, while creating challenges, have not prevented Chinese labs from producing highly competitive models (though they may make it harder for China to deploy their models at scale). Controls have severely limited Chinaâs share of the global AI infrastructure market, because, lacking competitive hardware, Chinese cloud computing firms have been unable to establish much, if any, AI infrastructure outside of China. To understand these effects, itâs useful to briefly review the structure and evolution of the export control regime. Escalated export controls began by prohibiting the sale of equipment essential for chip manufacturing. The US has had export controls on semiconductors and chipmaking equipment for decades, but the current phase of escalated controls on China began in 2018, when the US started encouraging the Netherlands to restrict sales of the most advanced extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography tools to Chinaâs leading chipmaker, the partially state-owned Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC).Â EUVs are produced by a single company â the Netherlandsâ ASML â and cost over $100 million each. Only a handful of companies have acquired these tools. Barring US pressure and the Dutch decision to block the sale, China would have acquired its first tool in 2019, and it would likely have acquired many more since then. The US strategy for containing China has shifted toward an explicit focus on AI. The blocked EUV sale was part of a US campaign to keep China technologically behind the US. This campaign ratcheted up in October 2022, shifting from broad containment to an explicit focus on constraining Chinaâs AI industry. That shift reflected a growing awareness within the US government of how AI progress increasingly depended on access to the computational (âcomputeâ) hardware required to train AI models. US government officials had been closely tracking trends in AI, including the central role of âscaling lawsâ â the prediction, based on empirical observations, that AI capabilities are improved by larger training runs. If these scaling laws held, access to the most advanced semiconductors would be an important precondition for developing and deploying AI at scale. The October 2022 controls thus sought to limit Chinaâs access to chipmaking tools and AI chips themselves, which at the time were made mostly by US firms like Nvidia. Shortly after, Japan and the Netherlands â the two other countries that produce advanced chipmaking tools â imposed controls similar to those US export restrictions. Taiwan and South Korea, which have high-end chip-manufacturing capabilities, have also enforced control rules (with loopholes, discussed below). The US has since tightened controls even further, through several rounds of new restrictions on the transfer of tools and chips to China. To understand the impact of these restrictions on Chinaâs chipmaking capabilities, we have to consider the counterfactual: how much progress would China have made in the absence of export controls? SMIC could have become the second-largest producer of advanced AI chips. We know that SMIC would have acquired at least one EUV tool in 2019, had it not been blocked from doing so. Had that sale gone through, SMIC would probably have bought many more. Chinaâs government, in turn, would likely have moved to support the entry of SMIC into the industry by ramping up public investment. In this scenario, SMIC would likely have become a far larger producer of advanced AI chips than South Koreaâs Samsung, Americaâs Intel, and any other firm, except for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). The emergence of SMIC as a major player in advanced chip production would likely have led Western firms to invest less, on the rational conclusion that SMIC would drive down the profitability of competing investments. This same dynamic has played out in the market for less-advanced foundational semiconductors in recent years, where Chinaâs access to relevant chipmaking tools has not been restricted.Â Export controls have had knock-on effects on other Chinese technological capabilities. Access to high-end tools would also have supercharged Chinaâs capabilities to produce high-bandwidth memory chips, which must be paired with AI processors for efficient training and inference: the process of running a trained model to generate outputs in real-world applications. While Chinaâs leading firm in this sphere, ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT), has faced somewhat weaker restrictions than SMIC, which produces processors for Huawei, it has still been banned from acquiring EUV tools and other types of advanced tools that are useful in efficient memory chip manufacturing. Today, most of the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips paired with Huaweiâs AI processors are either purchased or smuggled from abroad. Better access to advanced tools would have improved CXMTâs pathway to producing cutting-edge HBM.Â Export controls have made China a marginal producer of AI chips. Setting aside the counterfactual, let's consider the actual impact of export controls since 2018: restricted access to chipmaking tools has severely hindered Chinaâs industry. The result is that China remains a marginal producer of AI chips. According to recent congressional testimony by US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Huawei will produce only 200,000 AI chips in 2025. By contrast, in 2024, China reportedly legally imported around 1 million chips that Nvidia had downgraded specifically for the Chinese market. Chinese companies must resort to smuggling. This inability to produce large volumes of advanced chips domestically explains why Huawei and other Chinese companies have resorted to large-scale smuggling. While many of the specific smuggling schemes reported in the media involve relatively small numbers of chips, the prevalence of such anecdotes suggests that the volume of chips entering China via this route is significant. Whatâs more, Huawei worked with a shell company that, until 2024, illegally procured over 2 million chips from TSMC.Â In other words, Huaweiâs largest supplier of chips today is not Chinaâs domestic manufacturing capabilities but, instead, a shell company illegally sourcing chips from Taiwan. This is a dramatically different status quo from the counterfactual scenario, in which SMIC would be a close second to TSMC in advanced chip manufacturing.Â China is unlikely to catch up. For now, therefore, Chinaâs AI chip production capacity is far behind the Westâs. Its evolution relative to that of Western countries will depend on Chinese firmsâ ability to make do with second-best equipment; the level of future US controls, which could be tightened or loosened; and the rate of technological advance in the Western supply chain.Â Most estimates suggest that China is likely to increase its production capacity over the next few years. (Of course, TSMC will increase its capacity and develop even more capable manufacturing techniques, too.) Chinese models have advanced despite export controls. Chip export controls have clearly had a significant negative impact on Chinaâs ability to produce advanced chips. But have those hardware limitations hindered the capability of Chinese models? Perhaps surprisingly, the answer is: not really.Â Chinese firms like Alibaba and DeepSeek have produced impressive large language models that score highly on established benchmarks for assessing model quality. Other firms, like ByteDance (which owns TikTok), focus on training internal models to recommend videos that are more addictive; by all accounts, ByteDance has done this very effectively. It is true, of course, that Chinese entrepreneurs in the AI space often talk about the problems that AI chip export controls cause them. Liang Wenfeng, founder of DeepSeek, has publicly said on multiple occasions that his greatest single challenge is accessing chips. In a 2024 interview , he said, âMoney has never been the problem for us; bans on shipments of advanced chips are the problem.âÂ But, despite this frustration, the technical benchmarks suggest that Chinaâs AI models do not have a significant capability gap compared with US-produced models. In some ways, they have innovated to get around the limitations of not having high-end chips.Â It could be the case that, over the next year or two, the chip access gap between US and Chinese firms will grow. US firms will build far larger clusters and will therefore be able to train significantly better AI systems. However, the trend of the last three years suggests the opposite: that, according to benchmarks, US and Chinese model capabilities are fairly evenly matched.Â Export controls may have limited Chinaâs ability to deploy AI. While chip restrictions havenât significantly limited Chinaâs ability to train cutting-edge models, they may have impacted Chinese firmsâ ability to deploy their models at scale. After the release of its R1 model earlier this year, DeepSeek had to restrict access to its API, presumably because it couldnât provide enough inference compute to meet user demand. That interpretation is supported by remarks from Tencent Cloud senior executive Wang Qi, who earlier this year suggested that deficits of advanced chips could slow AI adoption by limiting inference availability or driving up costs. Thus far, however, it isnât clear that chip deficits are delaying AI uptake in China. Puzzlingly, utilization in many of Chinaâs data centers appears to be relatively low, with media reports suggesting that up to 80% of Chinaâs AI chips may be unused. Many of China's medium-sized data centers appear to lack the stability to serve AI models at scale. This dynamic may be driven in part by heavy investment from state-owned telecoms and other state-owned firms, which have often managed these facilities very poorly.Â Export controls may have driven Chinese firms to buy chips they didnât need. Another intriguing possibility is that the inefficiency of Chinese data centers has been exacerbated by chip export controls. If these controls signaled to Chinaâs leadership that AI data center capacity was important â and if that conclusion signaled to state-owned firms that they should buy AI chips â it is possible that the controls have contributed to low utilization rates by encouraging less capable Chinese firms to buy chips for political rather than market reasons. If so, this would be a counterintuitive mechanism for chip export controls to have had an impact â though evidence for this is weak. For now, despite some unanswered questions around uptake, we must conclude that chip export controls have not seriously slowed improvements in Chinese model quality. The last dimension along which to examine the impact of export controls is Chinaâs ability to provide AI infrastructure to the rest of the world: that is, the chips and servers inside AI data centers. Several factors have made US firms â primarily Nvidia â the default global provider of high-end chips around the world, including in China. The quality of the companyâs chips and the depth of its software ecosystem are key factors contributing to its strong market position. But export controls have also shaped the market.Â Chinese companies remain dependent on US AI chips. Restrictions on the sale of chipmaking equipment have done more than drastically limit Chinaâs domestic chipmaking capabilities. They have also helped to guarantee that, because Chinese alternatives are not available at scale, Chinese firms still want to buy large numbers of US chips (such as, until recently, H20s ). Had SMIC been able to buy advanced tools and ramp up its production, it might have been able to meet Chinese tech firmsâ chip demand by producing Huaweiâs Ascend GPUs. Today, it cannot produce at the scale required. Export controls have significantly impacted Chinaâs influence abroad. This dynamic has been even more pronounced outside of China. The limits on Huaweiâs ability to source AI chips have made it a negligible player in providing AI cloud computing capabilities outside of China. Today, there is just one data point â an announced deal to deploy 3,000 Ascend GPUs in Malaysia that was later retracted by the Malaysian government. Beyond that, global AI infrastructure outside China is overwhelmingly built on Western chips â a significant limit on Chinese power.Â Half a decade of intensified export controls has left China with lopsided areas of agency: it has developed AI models whose capabilities rival those of US firms, but its inability to match US chipmaking capabilities has left it more reliant on American hardware to train and deploy these models â even domestically. It has especially limited Chinaâs ability to deploy AI infrastructure abroad.Â Several key uncertainties will shape the future impact of these controls.Â Access to advanced chips will remain critical. Current trends suggest that access to advanced AI chips will be a critical factor in shaping the future of AI. The past six years of export controls on chips and chipmaking equipment have given the US a commanding position in AI hardware globally.Â There is no serious challenge to the US. For now, there is no serious Chinese alternative providing AI infrastructure to Southeast Asia, the Middle East, or other regions. Even China is still importing US AI chips. This control of essential hardware gives Washington outsized leverage in shaping a technology that will define the future.

Have these controls achieved their goals ? Have the assumptions driving them been confirmed or undermined by the rapid evolution of the chip industry and AI capabilities ? Â Three factors for assessing chip export controls . We can now draw preliminary conclusions by assessing three factors : Chinaâs domestic chipmaking capability , the sophistication of its AI models , and its market share in providing AI infrastructure . Initial evidence shows that controls have succeeded in several important ways , though not all . Restrictions on chipmaking tool sales have significantly slowed the growth of Chinaâs chipmaking capability . However , restrictions on the export of AI chips to China , while creating challenges , have not prevented Chinese labs from producing highly competitive models ( though they may make it harder for China to deploy their models at scale ) . Controls have severely limited Chinaâs share of the global AI infrastructure market , because , lacking competitive hardware , Chinese cloud computing firms have been unable to establish much , if any , AI infrastructure outside of China . To understand these effects , itâs useful to briefly review the structure and evolution of the export control regime . Escalated export controls began by prohibiting the sale of equipment essential for chip manufacturing . The US has had export controls on semiconductors and chipmaking equipment for decades , but the current phase of escalated controls on China began in 2018 , when the US started encouraging the Netherlands to restrict sales of the most advanced extreme ultraviolet ( EUV ) lithography tools to Chinaâs leading chipmaker , the partially state-owned Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation ( SMIC ) .Â EUVs are produced by a single company â the Netherlandsâ ASML â and cost over $ 100 million each . Only a handful of companies have acquired these tools . Barring US pressure and the Dutch decision to block the sale , China would have acquired its first tool in 2019 , and it would likely have acquired many more since then . The US strategy for containing China has shifted toward an explicit focus on AI . The blocked EUV sale was part of a US campaign to keep China technologically behind the US . This campaign ratcheted up in October 2022 , shifting from broad containment to an explicit focus on constraining Chinaâs AI industry . That shift reflected a growing awareness within the US government of how AI progress increasingly depended on access to the computational ( âcomputeâ ) hardware required to train AI models . US government officials had been closely tracking trends in AI , including the central role of âscaling lawsâ â the prediction , based on empirical observations , that AI capabilities are improved by larger training runs . If these scaling laws held , access to the most advanced semiconductors would be an important precondition for developing and deploying AI at scale . The October 2022 controls thus sought to limit Chinaâs access to chipmaking tools and AI chips themselves , which at the time were made mostly by US firms like Nvidia . Shortly after , Japan and the Netherlands â the two other countries that produce advanced chipmaking tools â imposed controls similar to those US export restrictions . Taiwan and South Korea , which have high-end chip-manufacturing capabilities , have also enforced control rules ( with loopholes , discussed below ) . The US has since tightened controls even further , through several rounds of new restrictions on the transfer of tools and chips to China . To understand the impact of these restrictions on Chinaâs chipmaking capabilities , we have to consider the counterfactual : how much progress would China have made in the absence of export controls ? SMIC could have become the second-largest producer of advanced AI chips . We know that SMIC would have acquired at least one EUV tool in 2019 , had it not been blocked from doing so . Had that sale gone through , SMIC would probably have bought many more . Chinaâs government , in turn , would likely have moved to support the entry of SMIC into the industry by ramping up public investment . In this scenario , SMIC would likely have become a far larger producer of advanced AI chips than South Koreaâs Samsung , Americaâs Intel , and any other firm , except for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( TSMC ) . The emergence of SMIC as a major player in advanced chip production would likely have led Western firms to invest less , on the rational conclusion that SMIC would drive down the profitability of competing investments . This same dynamic has played out in the market for less-advanced foundational semiconductors in recent years , where Chinaâs access to relevant chipmaking tools has not been restricted.Â Export controls have had knock-on effects on other Chinese technological capabilities . Access to high-end tools would also have supercharged Chinaâs capabilities to produce high-bandwidth memory chips , which must be paired with AI processors for efficient training and inference : the process of running a trained model to generate outputs in real-world applications . While Chinaâs leading firm in this sphere , ChangXin Memory Technologies ( CXMT ) , has faced somewhat weaker restrictions than SMIC , which produces processors for Huawei , it has still been banned from acquiring EUV tools and other types of advanced tools that are useful in efficient memory chip manufacturing . Today , most of the high-bandwidth memory ( HBM ) chips paired with Huaweiâs AI processors are either purchased or smuggled from abroad . Better access to advanced tools would have improved CXMTâs pathway to producing cutting-edge HBM.Â Export controls have made China a marginal producer of AI chips . Setting aside the counterfactual , let 's consider the actual impact of export controls since 2018 : restricted access to chipmaking tools has severely hindered Chinaâs industry . The result is that China remains a marginal producer of AI chips . According to recent congressional testimony by US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick , Huawei will produce only 200,000 AI chips in 2025 . By contrast , in 2024 , China reportedly legally imported around 1 million chips that Nvidia had downgraded specifically for the Chinese market . Chinese companies must resort to smuggling . This inability to produce large volumes of advanced chips domestically explains why Huawei and other Chinese companies have resorted to large-scale smuggling . While many of the specific smuggling schemes reported in the media involve relatively small numbers of chips , the prevalence of such anecdotes suggests that the volume of chips entering China via this route is significant . Whatâs more , Huawei worked with a shell company that , until 2024 , illegally procured over 2 million chips from TSMC.Â In other words , Huaweiâs largest supplier of chips today is not Chinaâs domestic manufacturing capabilities but , instead , a shell company illegally sourcing chips from Taiwan . This is a dramatically different status quo from the counterfactual scenario , in which SMIC would be a close second to TSMC in advanced chip manufacturing.Â China is unlikely to catch up . For now , therefore , Chinaâs AI chip production capacity is far behind the Westâs . Its evolution relative to that of Western countries will depend on Chinese firmsâ ability to make do with second-best equipment ; the level of future US controls , which could be tightened or loosened ; and the rate of technological advance in the Western supply chain.Â Most estimates suggest that China is likely to increase its production capacity over the next few years . ( Of course , TSMC will increase its capacity and develop even more capable manufacturing techniques , too . ) Chinese models have advanced despite export controls . Chip export controls have clearly had a significant negative impact on Chinaâs ability to produce advanced chips . But have those hardware limitations hindered the capability of Chinese models ? Perhaps surprisingly , the answer is : not really.Â Chinese firms like Alibaba and DeepSeek have produced impressive large language models that score highly on established benchmarks for assessing model quality . Other firms , like ByteDance ( which owns TikTok ) , focus on training internal models to recommend videos that are more addictive ; by all accounts , ByteDance has done this very effectively . It is true , of course , that Chinese entrepreneurs in the AI space often talk about the problems that AI chip export controls cause them . Liang Wenfeng , founder of DeepSeek , has publicly said on multiple occasions that his greatest single challenge is accessing chips . In a 2024 interview , he said , âMoney has never been the problem for us ; bans on shipments of advanced chips are the problem.âÂ But , despite this frustration , the technical benchmarks suggest that Chinaâs AI models do not have a significant capability gap compared with US-produced models . In some ways , they have innovated to get around the limitations of not having high-end chips.Â It could be the case that , over the next year or two , the chip access gap between US and Chinese firms will grow . US firms will build far larger clusters and will therefore be able to train significantly better AI systems . However , the trend of the last three years suggests the opposite : that , according to benchmarks , US and Chinese model capabilities are fairly evenly matched.Â Export controls may have limited Chinaâs ability to deploy AI . While chip restrictions havenât significantly limited Chinaâs ability to train cutting-edge models , they may have impacted Chinese firmsâ ability to deploy their models at scale . After the release of its R1 model earlier this year , DeepSeek had to restrict access to its API , presumably because it couldnât provide enough inference compute to meet user demand . That interpretation is supported by remarks from Tencent Cloud senior executive Wang Qi , who earlier this year suggested that deficits of advanced chips could slow AI adoption by limiting inference availability or driving up costs . Thus far , however , it isnât clear that chip deficits are delaying AI uptake in China . Puzzlingly , utilization in many of Chinaâs data centers appears to be relatively low , with media reports suggesting that up to 80 % of Chinaâs AI chips may be unused . Many of China 's medium-sized data centers appear to lack the stability to serve AI models at scale . This dynamic may be driven in part by heavy investment from state-owned telecoms and other state-owned firms , which have often managed these facilities very poorly.Â Export controls may have driven Chinese firms to buy chips they didnât need . Another intriguing possibility is that the inefficiency of Chinese data centers has been exacerbated by chip export controls . If these controls signaled to Chinaâs leadership that AI data center capacity was important â and if that conclusion signaled to state-owned firms that they should buy AI chips â it is possible that the controls have contributed to low utilization rates by encouraging less capable Chinese firms to buy chips for political rather than market reasons . If so , this would be a counterintuitive mechanism for chip export controls to have had an impact â though evidence for this is weak . For now , despite some unanswered questions around uptake , we must conclude that chip export controls have not seriously slowed improvements in Chinese model quality . The last dimension along which to examine the impact of export controls is Chinaâs ability to provide AI infrastructure to the rest of the world : that is , the chips and servers inside AI data centers . Several factors have made US firms â primarily Nvidia â the default global provider of high-end chips around the world , including in China . The quality of the companyâs chips and the depth of its software ecosystem are key factors contributing to its strong market position . But export controls have also shaped the market.Â Chinese companies remain dependent on US AI chips . Restrictions on the sale of chipmaking equipment have done more than drastically limit Chinaâs domestic chipmaking capabilities . They have also helped to guarantee that , because Chinese alternatives are not available at scale , Chinese firms still want to buy large numbers of US chips ( such as , until recently , H20s ) . Had SMIC been able to buy advanced tools and ramp up its production , it might have been able to meet Chinese tech firmsâ chip demand by producing Huaweiâs Ascend GPUs . Today , it can not produce at the scale required . Export controls have significantly impacted Chinaâs influence abroad . This dynamic has been even more pronounced outside of China . The limits on Huaweiâs ability to source AI chips have made it a negligible player in providing AI cloud computing capabilities outside of China . Today , there is just one data point â an announced deal to deploy 3,000 Ascend GPUs in Malaysia that was later retracted by the Malaysian government . Beyond that , global AI infrastructure outside China is overwhelmingly built on Western chips â a significant limit on Chinese power.Â Half a decade of intensified export controls has left China with lopsided areas of agency : it has developed AI models whose capabilities rival those of US firms , but its inability to match US chipmaking capabilities has left it more reliant on American hardware to train and deploy these models â even domestically . It has especially limited Chinaâs ability to deploy AI infrastructure abroad.Â Several key uncertainties will shape the future impact of these controls.Â Access to advanced chips will remain critical . Current trends suggest that access to advanced AI chips will be a critical factor in shaping the future of AI . The past six years of export controls on chips and chipmaking equipment have given the US a commanding position in AI hardware globally.Â There is no serious challenge to the US . For now , there is no serious Chinese alternative providing AI infrastructure to Southeast Asia , the Middle East , or other regions . Even China is still importing US AI chips .

US,techblog.comsoc.org,news,2025-04-21T19:40:22-04:00,IEEE ComSoc Technology Blog,"Damage of U.S. Export Controls and Trade War with China: The U.S. big tech sector, especially needs to know what the rules of the trade game will be looking ahead instead of the on-again/off-again Trump tariffs and trade war with China which includes 145% tariffs and export controls on AI chips from Nvidia, AMD, and other U.S. semiconductor companies. The latest export restriction on Nvidia’s H20 AI chips are a case in point. Nvidia said it would record a $5.5 billion charge on its quarterly earnings after it disclosed that the U.S. will now require a license for exporting the company’s H20 processors to China and other countries . The U.S. government told the chip maker on April 14th that the new license requirement would be in place “indefinitely.” Nvidia designed the H20 chip to comply with existing U.S. export controls that limit sales of advanced AI processors to Chinese customers. That meant the chip’s capabilities were significantly degraded; Morgan Stanley analyst Joe Moore estimates the H20’s performance is about 75% below that of Nvidia’s H100 family. The Commerce Department said it was issuing new export-licensing requirements covering H20 chips and AMD’s MI308 AI processors . Big Chinese cloud companies like Tencent, ByteDance (TikTok’s parent), Alibaba, Baidu , and iFlytek have been left scrambling for domestic alternatives to the H20 , the primary AI chip that Nvidia had until recently been allowed to sell freely into the Chinese market. Some analysts suggest that H20 bulk orders to build a stockpile were a response to concerns about future U.S. export restrictions and a race to secure limited supplies of Nvidia chips. The estimate is that there’s a 90 days supply of H20 chips, but it’s uncertain what China big tech companies will use when that runs out. The inability to sell even a low-performance chip into the Chinese market shows how the trade war will hurt Nvidia’s business. The AI chip king is now caught between the world’s two superpowers as they jockey to take the lead in AI development. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang “flew to China to do damage control and make sure China/Xi knows Nvidia wants/needs China to maintain its global ironclad grip on the AI Revolution,” the analysts note. The markets and tech world are tired of “deal progress” talks from the White House and want deals starting to be inked so they can plan their future strategy. The analysts think this is a critical week ahead to get some trade deals on the board, because Wall Street has stopped caring about words and comments around “deal progress.” “With Nvidia’s H20 and other advanced GPUs restricted, domestic alternatives like Huawei’s Ascend series are gaining traction,” said Doug O’Laughlin, an industry analyst at independent semiconductor research company SemiAnalysis . “While there are still gaps in software maturity and overall ecosystem readiness, hardware performance is closing in fast,” O’Laughlin added. According to the SemiAnalysis report, Huawei’s Ascend chip shows how China’s export controls have failed to stop firms like Huawei from accessing critical foreign tools and sub-components needed for advanced GPUs. “While Huawei’s Ascend chip can be fabricated at SMIC, this is a global chip that has HBM from Korea, primary wafer production from TSMC, and is fabricated by 10s of billions of wafer fabrication equipment from the US, Netherlands, and Japan,” the report stated. Huawei’s New AI Chip May Dominate in China: Huawei Technologies plans to begin mass shipments of its advanced 910C artificial intelligence chip to Chinese customers as early as next month, according to Reuters . Some shipments have already been made, people familiar with the matter said. Huawei’s 910C, a graphics processing unit (GPU) , represents an architectural evolution rather than a technological breakthrough, according to one of the two people and a third source familiar with its design. It achieves performance comparable to Nvidia’s H100 chip by combining two 910B processors into a single package through advanced integration techniques, they said. That means it has double the computing power and memory capacity of the 910B and it also has incremental improvements, including enhanced support for diverse AI workload data. Conclusions : The U.S. Commerce Department’s latest export curbs on Nvidia’s H20 “will mean that Huawei’s Ascend 910C GPU will now become the hardware of choice for (Chinese) AI model developers and for deploying inference capacity,” said Paul Triolo, a partner at consulting firm Albright Stonebridge Group.

The H20 graphic processing unit (GPU) was specifically designed for sale in the Chinese market to comply with U.S. export controls, but ByteDance, Alibaba and Tencent began preparing last year for the possibility that Washington could curb their shipments, too, sources said. These chips, specifically designed to comply with U.S. export controls, are vital for AI applications, particularly inference tasks. ByteDance, one of the most aggressive buyers, and other firms reportedly placed rush orders worth over $12 billion, with several billion dollars’ worth shipped before the new restrictions took effect earlier this month, according to the report. The H20 is a downgraded version of Nvidia’s H100 chip, popular in China due to its lower power requirements compared to the original model. Earlier this month, Nvidia said it would take a $5.5 billion hit in the first quarter due to the new restrictions. With the new curbs, Chinese firms are looking at alternatives like Huawei’s Ascend chips and exploring ways to bypass the export restrictions, including setting up overseas subsidiaries, Nikkei reported. The stockpiling comes amid surging demand for AI computing power in China, fueled by the rise of applications like DeepSeek integrated into Tencent’s WeChat. Source: Nikkei Asia Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang criticized U.S. export controls blocking the sale of its AI chips to China. Last month, the company took a $5.5 billion write-down to its inventory, after the U.S. demanded companies get a license to sell their AI chips to China. Huang called the export curbs “a failure” during a tech forum in Taipei on Wednesday. “The local companies are very, very talented and very determined, and the export control gave them the spirit, the energy, and the government support to accelerate their development,” Huang told the media during the Computex show in Taipei. “I think, all in all, the export control was a failure,” he said. Beginning in 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce implemented new criteria for some AI chips by restricting their exportation to China. The move was in an effort to “keep advanced technologies out of the wrong hands,” a spokesperson told Reuters three years ago. To get around these restrictions, Nvidia downgraded one of its chips to make it less powerful. Fast-forward to last month, when the chipmaker said the U.S. demanded a license for some of its AI chips, contributing to a $5.5 billion charge on inventory slated for sale, according to an 8-K filing. Nvidia’s command of the Chinese AI chip market has declined significantly since the progressive tightening began. According to Huang, when former President Joe Biden took office, the chipmaker held a 95% share of the market. In the years since, it has declined to 50%. “China has a vibrant technology ecosystem, and it’s very important to realize that China has 50% of the world’s AI researchers, and China is incredibly good at software,” Huang said. “AI researchers are still doing AI research in China. If they don’t have enough Nvidia, they will use their own,” Huang added. While global demand for Nvidia chips remains strong, Huang was in the Gulf region during President Donald Trump’s visit as the administration closed multibillion-dollar deals with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to sell chips. Trump administration officials think these deals will strengthen AI in the U.S. to catapult it ahead in the AI race. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jensen-huang-blasts-u-curbs-071300758.html Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang warned against the Trump administration’s decision to ban Nvidia chip sales to China, saying that the AI platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally. “China is one of the world’s largest AI markets and a springboard to AI success,” Huang said, adding that China’s AI will move on with or without US-made chips like Nvidia’s. Nvidia announced that the Trump administration banned sales of its H20 chip to China in April and reported a $4.5 billion revenue impact in its first fiscal quarter. The company says it will also miss out on $8 billion worth of H20 revenue in its second quarter. Nvidia says it can no longer build chips on its Hopper platform to manufacture chips for China. The company’s Hopper line is the predecessor to Nvidia’s current Blackwell chips. Nvidia specifically designed the H20 to meet the Biden administration’s restrictions on AI chips destined for China. But DeepSeek sent shockwaves through Washington and Wall Street when it proved it could produce powerful AI models using below top-of-the-line Nvidia chips. As a result, President Trump imposed tighter restrictions on the company’s chips, banning the sale of H20s in the country. “The AI race isn’t just about chips,” he said, adding that the more important aspect of the US-China AI battle is the software stack that companies build on. Huang has previously laid out how important it is for Nvidia to continue to compete in China, explaining that the country has half of the world’s AI developers and that driving those workers to build on Chinese chips would hurt not just Nvidia, but also the US’ national security goals. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-touts-us-manufacturing-plans-warns-china-export-controls-threaten-us-chip-lead-231557180.html Nvidia’s warning highlights a crucial point: restricting AI chip sales to China may backfire.

The latest export restriction on Nvidia’s H20 AI chips are a case in point. Nvidia said it would record a $5.5 billion charge on its quarterly earnings after it disclosed that the U.S. will now require a license for exporting the company’s H20 processors to China and other countries . The U.S. government told the chip maker on April 14th that the new license requirement would be in place “indefinitely.” Nvidia designed the H20 chip to comply with existing U.S. export controls that limit sales of advanced AI processors to Chinese customers. That meant the chip’s capabilities were significantly degraded; Morgan Stanley analyst Joe Moore estimates the H20’s performance is about 75% below that of Nvidia’s H100 family. The Commerce Department said it was issuing new export-licensing requirements covering H20 chips and AMD’s MI308 AI processors . Big Chinese cloud companies like Tencent, ByteDance (TikTok’s parent), Alibaba, Baidu , and iFlytek have been left scrambling for domestic alternatives to the H20 , the primary AI chip that Nvidia had until recently been allowed to sell freely into the Chinese market. Some analysts suggest that H20 bulk orders to build a stockpile were a response to concerns about future U.S. export restrictions and a race to secure limited supplies of Nvidia chips. The estimate is that there’s a 90 days supply of H20 chips, but it’s uncertain what China big tech companies will use when that runs out. The inability to sell even a low-performance chip into the Chinese market shows how the trade war will hurt Nvidia’s business. The AI chip king is now caught between the world’s two superpowers as they jockey to take the lead in AI development. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang “flew to China to do damage control and make sure China/Xi knows Nvidia wants/needs China to maintain its global ironclad grip on the AI Revolution,” the analysts note. The markets and tech world are tired of “deal progress” talks from the White House and want deals starting to be inked so they can plan their future strategy. The analysts think this is a critical week ahead to get some trade deals on the board, because Wall Street has stopped caring about words and comments around “deal progress.” “With Nvidia’s H20 and other advanced GPUs restricted, domestic alternatives like Huawei’s Ascend series are gaining traction,” said Doug O’Laughlin, an industry analyst at independent semiconductor research company SemiAnalysis . “While there are still gaps in software maturity and overall ecosystem readiness, hardware performance is closing in fast,” O’Laughlin added. According to the SemiAnalysis report, Huawei’s Ascend chip shows how China’s export controls have failed to stop firms like Huawei from accessing critical foreign tools and sub-components needed for advanced GPUs. “While Huawei’s Ascend chip can be fabricated at SMIC, this is a global chip that has HBM from Korea, primary wafer production from TSMC, and is fabricated by 10s of billions of wafer fabrication equipment from the US, Netherlands, and Japan,” the report stated. Huawei’s New AI Chip May Dominate in China: Huawei Technologies plans to begin mass shipments of its advanced 910C artificial intelligence chip to Chinese customers as early as next month, according to Reuters . Some shipments have already been made, people familiar with the matter said. Huawei’s 910C, a graphics processing unit (GPU) , represents an architectural evolution rather than a technological breakthrough, according to one of the two people and a third source familiar with its design. It achieves performance comparable to Nvidia’s H100 chip by combining two 910B processors into a single package through advanced integration techniques, they said. That means it has double the computing power and memory capacity of the 910B and it also has incremental improvements, including enhanced support for diverse AI workload data. Conclusions : The U.S. Commerce Department’s latest export curbs on Nvidia’s H20 “will mean that Huawei’s Ascend 910C GPU will now become the hardware of choice for (Chinese) AI model developers and for deploying inference capacity,” said Paul Triolo, a partner at consulting firm Albright Stonebridge Group.

US,internationalbanker.com,news,2025-11-12T05:00:56+00:00,Why China Has Banned Domestic Firms from Buying Nvidia’s AI Chips,"By Joseph Moss , International Banker “ We probably contributed more to the China market than most countries have. And I’m disappointed with what I see,” Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia, lamented when asked to comment on a report from the Financial Times that China’s internet regulator had banned the country’s biggest tech firms from buying Nvidia’s artificial intelligence (AI) chips. “But they have larger agendas to work out between China and the United States, and I’m understanding of that.” Against the backdrop of an intense trade stand-off with the United States, Beijing’s decision to implement the ban is also being viewed as a major power play to significantly boost the development of its domestic semiconductor sector. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) reportedly told companies such as TikTok’s parent ByteDance and Alibaba in mid-September to cease testing and ordering the RTX Pro 6000D chip, which Nvidia designed specifically for the Chinese market. The order came despite several companies having signalled their intentions to order tens of thousands of this AI chip, in many cases having already begun testing and verification work with Nvidia’s server suppliers, the FT added. The UK financial news publication had previously reported that China’s chipmakers are seeking to triple the country’s domestic AI output next year, as Beijing steps up its competition with the United States to develop the most advanced AI. The ban on Nvidia chips, therefore, appears to be in line with such ambitions. “The message is now loud and clear,” a tech company executive said after the ban was announced. “Earlier, people had hopes of renewed Nvidia supply if the geopolitical situation improves. Now it’s all hands on deck to build the domestic system.” “China clearly prefers to develop AI at its own pace on a domestic tech stack. Better to bite the bullet now than to rely on US tech that can be restricted upon a whim,” Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee (UBP), told Bloomberg . “A complete ban, if true, would show China’s confidence in its local supply chain somewhat. But still likely it’s a bargaining chip in the trade negotiations.” Indeed, the power of banning one of the US’ “Magnificent Seven” tech firms for use as leverage in ongoing trade discussions should not be discounted. “The move is likely to be a negotiation tactic as part of a broader set of discussions involving other topics, including tariffs,” AJ Kourabi, analyst at SemiAnalysis, explained to CNBC. “China is no doubt trying to encourage and establish silicon self-sovereignty, while also getting the best possible chip in the meantime.” Beijing’s push for “self-sovereignty” can also be seen as prudent risk management, especially amid the trade volatility unleashed by US President Donald Trump’s brutal tariff war. Nvidia’s H20 chip, which had been tailored to comply with US export restrictions, was blocked from being sent to China in April. “The problem with banning [H20 chips] is you’re effectively handing the AI market and training over to companies like Huawei or Cambricon or … other local players,” Stacy Rasgon, senior analyst of US semiconductors and semiconductor capital equipment at Bernstein Research, told Fortune . By August, the Trump Administration had granted certain export licenses to China for Nvidia and AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) chips, with the two companies agreeing to pay the US government 15 percent of their revenues from their chip sales to China. Nonetheless, Nvidia confirmed that no chip sales to China had been recorded during the second quarter. According to Huang, moreover, such trade aggression against China could backfire and damage the American AI industry. Nvidia’s chief executive officer (CEO) has frequently decried the US policy of export controls, arguing that they will only spur more rapid innovation among China’s domestic chipmakers. “The China market, I’ve estimated to be about $50 billion of opportunity for us this year if we were able to address it with competitive products,” Huang said during his company’s second-quarter earnings call. The Nvidia CEO recently cautioned that Washington should perhaps focus less on “policies that are hurtful to other people” and instead prioritise policies that are “helpful” to the US. “China has about 50 percent of the world’s AI researchers, incredible schools, incredible focus in AI, lots of passion around AI. And I think it’s a mistake to not have those researchers build AI on American technology,” Huang recently said at the Citadel Securities Future of Global Markets 2025 conference. “We are 100 percent out of China … we went from 95 percent market share to 0 percent, and so I can’t imagine any policymaker thinking that’s a good idea, that whatever policy we implemented caused America to lose one of the largest markets in the world.” China’s chip ban may also have been partly motivated by the findings published on September 15 by China’s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), which found that Nvidia had violated the country’s anti-monopoly law through its acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, an Israeli technology company that creates network solutions for data centres and servers. Although Chinese authorities had approved the deal in 2020, an investigation opened late last year re-examined some of the agreements made during the acquisition, although SAMR has yet to provide specific details of the violations. “We comply with the law in all respects,” a Nvidia spokesperson affirmed in a statement. “We will continue to cooperate with all relevant government agencies as they evaluate the impact of export controls on competition in the commercial markets.” Ongoing trade tensions with the US also appear to be significantly advancing China’s indigenous chipmaking capabilities, with the likes of Huawei Technologies, Cambricon Technologies, Alibaba and Baidu taking the lead. Almost as soon as the Nvidia ban was revealed, for instance, Huawei announced that it had developed what it calls the “world’s most powerful” supernode computing cluster, using local chipmaking processes—and without the use of Nvidia chips. “Huawei is seeking to build a ‘supernode + cluster’ computing solution using chip manufacturing processes available in China to meet the growing compute needs,” Xu Zhijun, Huawei’s deputy chairman, said at the time. In late August, China-based semiconductor firm Cambricon posted record profits of 1.04 billion yuan for the first six months of the year, compared with a 530-million-yuan loss a year earlier, while revenue surged by a staggering 4,300 percent to 2.88 billion yuan. Goldman Sachs stated it expected Cambricon’s AI-chip shipments to grow from 143,000 units in 2025 to 2.1 million in 2030. Guosheng Securities projected that the company would sustain its profitability in the coming quarters as revenue continues to grow. “With the AI ​​wave and the increasing chip localisation, we are optimistic about the company’s subsequent strong supply and demand,” Guosheng stated in a research note. That said, not everyone is convinced that China can completely eliminate Nvidia chips from its semiconductor industry. “In terms of China’s domestic chip preparedness, I believe it is misleading to suggest the country can advance AI at a current level solely with domestic alternatives and without NVIDIA’s systematic offerings,” Ray Wang, research director for semiconductors, supply chain and emerging technology at Futurum Group, told CNBC. Huawei itself even acknowledged in June that its chips trail the US by a generation, although the firm is finding ways to improve performance through methods such as cluster computing. “The United States has exaggerated Huawei’s achievements. Huawei is not that great. We have to work hard to reach their evaluation,” Huawei’s chief executive officer, Ren Zhengfei, told the state-run People’s Daily newspaper, as reported by Reuters . “Our single chip is still behind the US by a generation. We use mathematics to supplement physics, non-Moore’s law to supplement Moore’s law and cluster computing to supplement single chips, and the results can also achieve practical conditions. Software is not a bottleneck for us.” Nonetheless, China’s rapid progress in AI development cannot be ignored, with Nvidia’s Huang continuing to stress this burgeoning sector’s potential opportunities. “The Chinese market is important. It’s large. The technology industry is vibrant. We’ve been in service of it for 30 years,” the Nvidia CEO recently stated. Huang also confirmed that his company would “continue to be supportive of the Chinese government and Chinese companies as they wish, and we’re of course going to continue to support the US government as they all sort through these geopolitical policies”.

And I’m disappointed with what I see,” Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia, lamented when asked to comment on a report from the Financial Times that China’s internet regulator had banned the country’s biggest tech firms from buying Nvidia’s artificial intelligence (AI) chips. “But they have larger agendas to work out between China and the United States, and I’m understanding of that.” Against the backdrop of an intense trade stand-off with the United States, Beijing’s decision to implement the ban is also being viewed as a major power play to significantly boost the development of its domestic semiconductor sector. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) reportedly told companies such as TikTok’s parent ByteDance and Alibaba in mid-September to cease testing and ordering the RTX Pro 6000D chip, which Nvidia designed specifically for the Chinese market. The order came despite several companies having signalled their intentions to order tens of thousands of this AI chip, in many cases having already begun testing and verification work with Nvidia’s server suppliers, the FT added. The UK financial news publication had previously reported that China’s chipmakers are seeking to triple the country’s domestic AI output next year, as Beijing steps up its competition with the United States to develop the most advanced AI. The ban on Nvidia chips, therefore, appears to be in line with such ambitions. “The message is now loud and clear,” a tech company executive said after the ban was announced. “Earlier, people had hopes of renewed Nvidia supply if the geopolitical situation improves. Now it’s all hands on deck to build the domestic system.” “China clearly prefers to develop AI at its own pace on a domestic tech stack. Better to bite the bullet now than to rely on US tech that can be restricted upon a whim,” Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee (UBP), told Bloomberg . “A complete ban, if true, would show China’s confidence in its local supply chain somewhat. But still likely it’s a bargaining chip in the trade negotiations.” Indeed, the power of banning one of the US’ “Magnificent Seven” tech firms for use as leverage in ongoing trade discussions should not be discounted. “The move is likely to be a negotiation tactic as part of a broader set of discussions involving other topics, including tariffs,” AJ Kourabi, analyst at SemiAnalysis, explained to CNBC. “China is no doubt trying to encourage and establish silicon self-sovereignty, while also getting the best possible chip in the meantime.” Beijing’s push for “self-sovereignty” can also be seen as prudent risk management, especially amid the trade volatility unleashed by US President Donald Trump’s brutal tariff war. Nvidia’s H20 chip, which had been tailored to comply with US export restrictions, was blocked from being sent to China in April. “The problem with banning [H20 chips] is you’re effectively handing the AI market and training over to companies like Huawei or Cambricon or … other local players,” Stacy Rasgon, senior analyst of US semiconductors and semiconductor capital equipment at Bernstein Research, told Fortune . By August, the Trump Administration had granted certain export licenses to China for Nvidia and AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) chips, with the two companies agreeing to pay the US government 15 percent of their revenues from their chip sales to China. Nonetheless, Nvidia confirmed that no chip sales to China had been recorded during the second quarter. According to Huang, moreover, such trade aggression against China could backfire and damage the American AI industry. Nvidia’s chief executive officer (CEO) has frequently decried the US policy of export controls, arguing that they will only spur more rapid innovation among China’s domestic chipmakers. “The China market, I’ve estimated to be about $50 billion of opportunity for us this year if we were able to address it with competitive products,” Huang said during his company’s second-quarter earnings call. The Nvidia CEO recently cautioned that Washington should perhaps focus less on “policies that are hurtful to other people” and instead prioritise policies that are “helpful” to the US. “China has about 50 percent of the world’s AI researchers, incredible schools, incredible focus in AI, lots of passion around AI. And I think it’s a mistake to not have those researchers build AI on American technology,” Huang recently said at the Citadel Securities Future of Global Markets 2025 conference. “We are 100 percent out of China … we went from 95 percent market share to 0 percent, and so I can’t imagine any policymaker thinking that’s a good idea, that whatever policy we implemented caused America to lose one of the largest markets in the world.” China’s chip ban may also have been partly motivated by the findings published on September 15 by China’s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), which found that Nvidia had violated the country’s anti-monopoly law through its acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, an Israeli technology company that creates network solutions for data centres and servers. Although Chinese authorities had approved the deal in 2020, an investigation opened late last year re-examined some of the agreements made during the acquisition, although SAMR has yet to provide specific details of the violations. “We comply with the law in all respects,” a Nvidia spokesperson affirmed in a statement. “We will continue to cooperate with all relevant government agencies as they evaluate the impact of export controls on competition in the commercial markets.” Ongoing trade tensions with the US also appear to be significantly advancing China’s indigenous chipmaking capabilities, with the likes of Huawei Technologies, Cambricon Technologies, Alibaba and Baidu taking the lead.

US,www.businessinsider.com,news,2025-05-21T05:15:09.411Z,Jensen Huang says chip export rules for China are 'a failure',"Tech titan Jensen Huang slammed US rules on chip exports to China, which have hit Nvidia's business hard. In a session with reporters and industry analysts at the Computex Taipei tech conference in Taiwan on Wednesday, Huang said the chipmaker's market share in China has decreased to 50%, down from 95% four years ago. Huang also said Chinese tech companies have benefited from the crackdown. ""The export control gave them the spirit, the energy, and the government support to accelerate their development. So I think, all in all, the export control is a failure,"" he said. The US started taking steps to limit China's use of high-tech chips in 2022. Huang's comments on Wednesday mark an escalation from his previous messaging about the US's controls. In February, Huang told CNBC, ""It's hard to tell whether export control is effective."" In April, Nvidia said the Trump administration tightened rules that effectively banned the sale of the kinds of chips — H20 — Nvidia had created to comply with the Biden administration's export controls. The company said it expected a $5.5 billion charge in first-quarter earnings due to the new restrictions. About 13% of Nvidia's revenue in the year ending in January came from China and Hong Kong, down from 17% the year before. ""China is where 50% of the world's AI researchers are, and we want AI researchers to build on Nvidia. DeepSeek was built on Nvidia. That's a gift to us, that's a gift to the world,"" Huang said. On Wednesday, Huang repeated past compliments for DeepSeek, the AI startup that took global financial markets by surprise in January with a competitive new model, and for tech giant Huawei . He again called the latter, which builds its own chips, ""formidable."" ""Our competition in China is really intense,"" Huang said. The CEO also said the US has no monopoly on AI development. ""Power is quite cost-effective in China, and there's plenty of land. So the ban on H20 is not effective,"" he said. Huang added that there was no way to further ""degrade"" the company's current graphics processing unit architecture such that buyers would want it. Bouts of broad market and tech sell-offs and angst about export controls, among other issues, have depressed investor darling Nvidia's stock recently.

In a session with reporters and industry analysts at the Computex Taipei tech conference in Taiwan on Wednesday, Huang said the chipmaker's market share in China has decreased to 50%, down from 95% four years ago. Huang also said Chinese tech companies have benefited from the crackdown. ""The export control gave them the spirit, the energy, and the government support to accelerate their development.

About 13% of Nvidia's revenue in the year ending in January came from China and Hong Kong, down from 17% the year before. ""China is where 50% of the world's AI researchers are, and we want AI researchers to build on Nvidia. DeepSeek was built on Nvidia. That's a gift to us, that's a gift to the world,"" Huang said.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan, File) China has blasted a new U.S. rule against use of Ascend computer chips made by Huawei Technologies anywhere in the world, chafing Thursday against the limitations of a temporary truce in the trade war between the two biggest economies. Beijing moved ahead, however, with fulfilling its promise to lift retaliatory measures it imposed after U.S. President Donald Trump escalated his trade war, raising tariffs on Chinese products to as high as 145%. One key action was to remove a ban on exports to the United States of minerals known as rare earths that are used in many high-tech products. Despite the deal struck last weekend in Geneva, frictions remain . Earlier this week, the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security issued guidance saying that Huawei’s Ascend semiconductors are subject to U.S. export controls, on the basis that they are thought to employ U.S. technology. “These chips were likely developed or produced in violation of U.S. export controls,” it said in a statement on its website, adding that “the use of such PRC advanced computing ICs risks violating U.S. export controls and may subject companies to BIS enforcement action.” China’s Commerce Ministry responded that the move was “not conducive to long-term, mutually beneficial, and sustainable cooperation and development between the two countries. The Chinese side urges the U.S. side to immediately correct its erroneous practices,” said ministry spokesperson He Yongqian. Huawei’s Ascend chip is central to China’s effort to build its own capacity to build leading edge computer chips and other technologies. Analysts say use of the chip in China’s DeepSeek artificial intelligence effort reflects a potential challenge for Nvidia in the global AI market. He also lashed out against U.S. tariffs on imports of Chinese steel and aluminum, which have not gotten a reprieve after Beijing and Washington agreed to their pause in many tariff increases.

US,apnews.com,news,2025-10-29T11:02:36,"US government allowed and even helped US firms sell tech used for surveillance in China, AP finds","Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Image recognition analysis overlaid on scenes from Washington and meetings between U.S. and Chinese leaders. (AP video Marshall Ritzel) U.S. lawmakers have tried four times since September last year to close what they called a glaring loophole: China is getting around export bans on the sale of powerful American AI chips by renting them through U.S. cloud services instead. But the proposals prompted a flurry of activity from more than 100 lobbyists from tech companies and their trade associations trying to weigh in, according to disclosure reports. The result: All four times, the proposal failed, including just last month. Following a long-heralded meeting between leaders Donald Trump and Xi Jinping , the sale of U.S. technology to China remains among the thorniest issues the U.S. faces, with billions of dollars and the future of tech dominance at stake . But the tough talk about China obscures a deeper story: Even while warning about national security and human rights abuse, the U.S. government across five Republican and Democratic administrations has repeatedly allowed and even actively helped American firms to sell technology to Chinese police, government agencies and surveillance companies, an Associated Press investigation has found. U.S. President Donald Trump, left, meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a meeting on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan, June 29, 2019. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File) And time after time, despite bipartisan attempts, Congress has turned a blind eye to loopholes that allow China to work around its own rules, such as cloud services, third-party resellers, and holes in sanctions passed after the Tiananmen massacre . For example, despite U.S. export rules around advanced chips, China bought $20.7 billion worth of chipmaking equipment from U.S. companies in 2024 to bolster its homegrown industry, a report from a congressional committee this month warned. This reluctance to act reflects the tremendous wealth and power of the tech industry, which is more visible than ever under the Trump administration. And in recent months, the president himself has struck grand deals with Silicon Valley firms that even more closely tie the U.S. economy to tech exports to China, giving taxpayers a direct stake in the profits for the first time. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. In August, Trump announced a deal with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD to lift export controls on sales of advanced chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut of the revenue, despite concerns from national security experts that such chips will end up in the hands of Chinese military and intelligence services. Trump said after Thursday’s meeting with Xi that China would follow up with Nvidia on the sales of chips but did not announce any resolution. Trump also has announced that the U.S. government has taken a 10 percent stake in Intel worth around $11 billion. Longtime Chinese activist Zhou Fengsuo said the U.S. government is letting American companies set the agenda and ignoring how they help Beijing surveil and censor its own people. In 1989, Zhou was a student leader during the Tiananmen protests, where hundreds and possibly thousands were shot and killed by the Chinese government. Zhou was arrested and imprisoned.

(AP Photo/Ivan Valencia) Now a U.S. citizen, Zhou testified before Congress in 2024 , calling on Washington to investigate the involvement of American tech companies in Chinese surveillance. An AP investigation in September found that American companies to a large degree designed and built China’s surveillance state, playing a far greater role in enabling human rights abuses than previously known. “It’s driven by profit, and that’s why these strategic discussions have been silenced or delayed,” Zhou said. “I’m extremely disappointed. … this is a strategic failure by the United States.” The sale of technology to China is contentious among both Republicans and Democrats, with some arguing for a harder stance. They are fighting a powerful opponent. An AP analysis of lobbying filings showed U.S. tech and telecom companies, as well as their trade associations, spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the past two decades on lobbyists who listed key bills impacting China-related trade on their quarterly disclosure reports, among other issues.

Tech companies argue that further export restrictions will push China to develop its own domestic supply and strengthen its position in the global race for leadership in artificial intelligence. “Continuing to ban U.S. computing from commercial markets only benefits foreign competition and undercuts President Trump’s efforts to create jobs, reduce the trade deficit, and grow the economy,” Nvidia said in a statement. Nvidia has also said that it does not make surveillance systems or software, does not work with police in China and has not designed its H20 AI chip for police surveillance. Intel, which partnered with a Chinese fingerprinting company as recently as last year , has said the company follows export control policies, and did not address details of its deal with the U.S. government. “The U.S. government’s investment is a passive ownership, with no board representation, governance or information rights,” Intel said in a statement. AMD did not respond. The White House and the Commerce and State departments also did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The AP investigation was based on dozens of open record requests, hundreds of pages of congressional testimony, lobbying disclosures and dozens of interviews with current and former Chinese and American executives, politicians, and former federal officials. Under the cloud services loophole, Chinese companies barred from accessing cutting-edge chips can use Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services overseas instead to train their AI models. Microsoft and AWS also both advertise the capacity to store video surveillance footage on their cloud services for Chinese customers. Vistiors stand in line at a booth for Amazon cloud computing services at the China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS) in Beijing, Friday, Sept. 2, 2022. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, File) For example, SDIC Contech, a state-owned tech company that works with AI, sought access to AWS and Microsoft Azure big data analytics services, procurement bids show. And Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute , a government-backed research institute working on sensitive technologies such as encryption, sought access to $280,000 worth of Azure OpenAI cloud services from Microsoft. Even sanctioned Chinese companies can use AWS and Microsoft Azure to offer surveillance abilities to customers overseas. For example, despite U.S. sanctions over human rights abuses in Xinjiang in 2019, Dahua and Hikvision, China’s two largest surveillance companies, use AWS to offer networked surveillance abroad , according to marketing material on the company websites . Hikvision markets a video surveillance platform called “HikCentral” to private companies overseas, which can be also deployed on Azure, according to a post on Hikvision’s website this year . Microsoft denied providing services to Hikvision or partnering with them to provide services to others. OpenAI, which provides its advanced AI models through Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform, said it was subject to Microsoft’s policies and doesn’t support China’s access to its services. AWS did not respond on the record to questions about the cloud services loophole. Another enduring loophole is in the restrictions passed after the Tiananmen massacre that didn’t include newer policing technologies, such as security cameras, surveillance drives, or facial recognition systems. In 2006, 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013, lawmakers introduced bills to try and close the loophole. All failed. The U.S. government under both Republican and Democratic presidents has made other attempts to regulate tech surveillance exports to China. In 2008, the Department of Commerce asked for comment on whether to include “biometric devices” and “integrated security systems” under controlled exports, but ran out of time before the next administration came in. In 2014 and 2015, it tried to tighten controls on surveillance products , but most fell through. In 2024, it sought to restrict exports of face-recognition systems and bar many more military, police, and intelligence end users from receiving U.S. goods, with no success. Some politicians on both sides of the aisle blame the failures in part on the money and political influence of tech companies. “I think we’ve been naive or complicit in the extreme,” said New Jersey GOP Rep. Chris Smith. The U.S., he said, has been “selling and conveying to a malevolent power the ability to destroy us and destroy like-minded Western democracies.” “What do all those companies all have in common? A big wallet,” said Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon. “That is as much as anything is what’s behind the fact we haven’t made as much progress.” A rickshaw driver transports wounded people, with the help of bystanders, to a nearby hospital in Beijing, on Sunday, June 4, 1989, after PLA soldiers fired rounds towards crowds gathered outside Tiananmen Square. (AP Photo/Liu Heung Shing, File) The first round of U.S. prohibitions on Chinese police came after the Tiananmen massacre and applied to “crime control and detection” equipment. They largely stopped U.S. companies from exporting goods to Chinese entities such as restraints, helmets, shields and batons. But the controls were narrowly confined to largely low-tech goods, leaving out advanced technologies that could be used by police and leading at times to puzzling priorities. U.S. regulators warned sex shops against shipping novelty gold handcuffs to China. At the same time, they broadly permitted Silicon Valley companies to sell routers, servers, software, and more recently, AI-powered surveillance systems to Chinese police. For example, despite explicit restrictions on fingerprint recognition systems, U.S. companies still were able to sell gear to process, store and compare fingerprints. In 2006, with bipartisan support, Smith introduced the Global Online Freedom Act to curtail the involvement of American tech companies in Chinese surveillance. Smith drew parallels with IBM’s sale of computing gear to Nazi Germany, which has been well documented by historians . IBM told AP in a follow-up statement that the claim that IBM knowingly collaborated with Nazi Germany was “false and has been rejected by credible historians.” Associations representing the tech and telecommunications industries and dozens of companies stepped up their lobbying against Smith’s proposal, disclosures show. The companies argued the computers, servers and routers they sold in China were no different from what they sold to other countries. Industry groups and individual companies also submitted hundreds of comments to regulators, hoping to influence China-related export regulations. Smith’s bill went nowhere. Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., speaks about China during an interview in his office on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2025. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) “Money talks … When they flood certain members on strategic committees with the money, PAC money and the like, how much easier it is to listen to their narrative that somehow they’re part of the reform?” said Smith. Tech sales to China continued, sometimes with direct government support. Numerous archived webpages show that the U.S. Commercial Service, the export-promoting arm of the Commerce Department, played a crucial role for more than a decade in connecting U.S. vendors to Chinese security agencies and key government officials, including through its marquee Gold Key Matching service. In 2004, the Commercial Service invited American companies selling security technologies and equipment to show off their products at a Chinese security exposition. Two years later, it advertised opportunities for American firms in the “safety and security” market , followed by another publication later describing market opportunities for foreign security products such as inspection control and guard communication systems . Archived webpages also show that under both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, the Commercial Service steadily promoted U.S. participation in policing trade shows , even those that showcased “biological identification technologies” or were initiated by the Chinese Communist Party. Under Bush, the Commerce Department in 2007 hosted a webinar about how to sell to the Chinese security market and promote surveillance tools to China’s public sector. For just $35, the federal agency could offer attendees “market entry-strategies and long-term market penetration plans,” an archived webpage shows. Jeanette Chu, who then worked at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and helped give the 2007 webinar, recalled sometimes having concerns. “I used to ask myself all the time, ‘what is the scary potential of each item?’” said Chu, now a national security and trade expert advising industry. Despite promises to nail shut Washington’s revolving door, President Barack Obama — like presidents before and after him — gave former industry lobbyists and allies top jobs, including Eric Hirschhorn in the Commerce Department, who represented a trade group that lobbied for tech companies exporting abroad. Hirschhorn wrote that Beijing’s surveillance abilities were nothing compared to the half-million surveillance cameras blanketing London. He was put in charge of the office that administers U.S. export controls. A Chinese national flag flutters near surveillance cameras mounted on a lamp post in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, Friday, March 15, 2019. (AP Photo/Andy Wong, File) In an interview, Hirschhorn said export controls alone were an inefficient way to defend human rights. “You can use a computer to type an order or type a love note,” he told AP. “Are you not going to sell computers to China because one out of every 10,000 of them will be used to store data about a dissident?” In 2010, the U.S. State Department’s human rights report warned of “police surveillance, harassment and detentions of activists.” Yet U.S. Ambassador Jon Huntsman led a mission to promote American business interests in the far-west region of Xinjiang, where authorities had arrested thousands of ethnic Uyghurs and cut internet access after deadly unrest the year before . Huntsman did not respond to requests for comment. That same year, the Commercial Service spotlighted opportunities for U.S. companies to sell equipment directly to China’s central government “to install a city-wide infrastructure of security, surveillance, and alarm systems” on its website. A 2015 State Department draft plan for “smart city” cooperation obtained by AP proposed that China and the U.S. collaborate on joint research, such as on crime and “urban security,” and include private sector players such IBM. Additional documents AP obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request show the U.S. government also sought active counter-terrorism cooperation with China, which gave tech companies a chance for closer contact with Chinese authorities even as Beijing broadly labelled protest or dissent among Uyghurs as terrorism. Documents reviewed by the AP show how the U.S. government helped promote opportunities in the Chinese security market to American companies. (AP video Marshall Ritzel) Kevin Wolf, then an assistant secretary in charge of export controls at Commerce, said as news about human rights abuses inside China kept surfacing, he worried about U.S. innovations falling into the wrong hands. Wolf said he began drafting a rule to regulate certain surveillance gear sales in early 2016. “The problem I was struggling with was, mass surveillance can involve everyday ordinary common items: it’s cameras, it’s software, it’s facial recognition stuff and 99 percent of all of those applications are perfectly benign,” said Wolf, now a compliance attorney for industry. “So if you were to say, ban cameras that can read someone’s face, you blow up international trade.” Wolf’s colleagues told him the draft rule was too complicated, Wolf said, and it foundered. In 2018, Congress passed the Export Control Reform Act, giving Commerce authority to make export control rules about advanced technologies. In 2019 and 2020, the Trump administration sanctioned some Chinese officials and surveillance firms over atrocities in Xinjiang. But sales of surveillance equipment continued, albeit at a slower pace — though references to working with the Chinese police would disappear from annual Commerce Department reports for U.S. industry. In 2021, Joe Biden put out an executive order describing Chinese surveillance tech companies as “unusual and extraordinary threats” that enabled serious human rights abuses. In his final months in office, Biden’s administration drew up sprawling rules for exporting advanced computer chips used to develop AI systems. Commerce also floated an updated version of Wolf’s draft rule to keep facial recognition and other mass surveillance tools from reaching military and intelligence agencies and companies, including in China. But once again, Washington lobbyists, lawyers and politicians pushed back. “The result would slow business considerably and likely result in the loss of customers that do not present any national security or human rights concerns,” said a Chamber of Commerce filing from late last year. The proposed rule, in the end, stalled out.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) Haitiwaji was arrested and detained in internment camps in Xinjiang for more than two years, after policing systems based on U.S. technology led Chinese officers to identify her as a “terrorist.” She was under constant, excruciating surveillance, with cameras watching her even in the toilet. After she was released in 2019, she still found herself living in what she calls “an open-air prison,” with every move monitored, until she finally left Xinjiang later that year. She said U.S. tech companies show little accountability. “It’s truly disappointing that the United States, one of the most powerful countries in the world, would sell such technology to China despite knowing the potential for serious consequences,” Haitiwaji said. —- Burke reported from San Francisco and Washington, Kang reported from Beijing and Tau reported from Washington.

Image recognition analysis overlaid on scenes from Washington and meetings between U.S. and Chinese leaders. (AP video Marshall Ritzel) U.S. lawmakers have tried four times since September last year to close what they called a glaring loophole: China is getting around export bans on the sale of powerful American AI chips by renting them through U.S. cloud services instead. But the proposals prompted a flurry of activity from more than 100 lobbyists from tech companies and their trade associations trying to weigh in, according to disclosure reports. The result: All four times, the proposal failed, including just last month. Following a long-heralded meeting between leaders Donald Trump and Xi Jinping , the sale of U.S. technology to China remains among the thorniest issues the U.S. faces, with billions of dollars and the future of tech dominance at stake . But the tough talk about China obscures a deeper story: Even while warning about national security and human rights abuse, the U.S. government across five Republican and Democratic administrations has repeatedly allowed and even actively helped American firms to sell technology to Chinese police, government agencies and surveillance companies, an Associated Press investigation has found.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File) And time after time, despite bipartisan attempts, Congress has turned a blind eye to loopholes that allow China to work around its own rules, such as cloud services, third-party resellers, and holes in sanctions passed after the Tiananmen massacre . For example, despite U.S. export rules around advanced chips, China bought $20.7 billion worth of chipmaking equipment from U.S. companies in 2024 to bolster its homegrown industry, a report from a congressional committee this month warned. This reluctance to act reflects the tremendous wealth and power of the tech industry, which is more visible than ever under the Trump administration. And in recent months, the president himself has struck grand deals with Silicon Valley firms that even more closely tie the U.S. economy to tech exports to China, giving taxpayers a direct stake in the profits for the first time. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. In August, Trump announced a deal with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD to lift export controls on sales of advanced chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut of the revenue, despite concerns from national security experts that such chips will end up in the hands of Chinese military and intelligence services. Trump said after Thursday’s meeting with Xi that China would follow up with Nvidia on the sales of chips but did not announce any resolution. Trump also has announced that the U.S. government has taken a 10 percent stake in Intel worth around $11 billion. Longtime Chinese activist Zhou Fengsuo said the U.S. government is letting American companies set the agenda and ignoring how they help Beijing surveil and censor its own people. In 1989, Zhou was a student leader during the Tiananmen protests, where hundreds and possibly thousands were shot and killed by the Chinese government. Zhou was arrested and imprisoned.

(AP Photo/Ivan Valencia) Now a U.S. citizen, Zhou testified before Congress in 2024 , calling on Washington to investigate the involvement of American tech companies in Chinese surveillance. An AP investigation in September found that American companies to a large degree designed and built China’s surveillance state, playing a far greater role in enabling human rights abuses than previously known. “It’s driven by profit, and that’s why these strategic discussions have been silenced or delayed,” Zhou said. “I’m extremely disappointed. … this is a strategic failure by the United States.” The sale of technology to China is contentious among both Republicans and Democrats, with some arguing for a harder stance. They are fighting a powerful opponent. An AP analysis of lobbying filings showed U.S. tech and telecom companies, as well as their trade associations, spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the past two decades on lobbyists who listed key bills impacting China-related trade on their quarterly disclosure reports, among other issues.

Tech companies argue that further export restrictions will push China to develop its own domestic supply and strengthen its position in the global race for leadership in artificial intelligence. “Continuing to ban U.S. computing from commercial markets only benefits foreign competition and undercuts President Trump’s efforts to create jobs, reduce the trade deficit, and grow the economy,” Nvidia said in a statement. Nvidia has also said that it does not make surveillance systems or software, does not work with police in China and has not designed its H20 AI chip for police surveillance. Intel, which partnered with a Chinese fingerprinting company as recently as last year , has said the company follows export control policies, and did not address details of its deal with the U.S. government. “The U.S. government’s investment is a passive ownership, with no board representation, governance or information rights,” Intel said in a statement. AMD did not respond. The White House and the Commerce and State departments also did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The AP investigation was based on dozens of open record requests, hundreds of pages of congressional testimony, lobbying disclosures and dozens of interviews with current and former Chinese and American executives, politicians, and former federal officials. Under the cloud services loophole, Chinese companies barred from accessing cutting-edge chips can use Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services overseas instead to train their AI models. Microsoft and AWS also both advertise the capacity to store video surveillance footage on their cloud services for Chinese customers.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, File) For example, SDIC Contech, a state-owned tech company that works with AI, sought access to AWS and Microsoft Azure big data analytics services, procurement bids show. And Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute , a government-backed research institute working on sensitive technologies such as encryption, sought access to $280,000 worth of Azure OpenAI cloud services from Microsoft. Even sanctioned Chinese companies can use AWS and Microsoft Azure to offer surveillance abilities to customers overseas. For example, despite U.S. sanctions over human rights abuses in Xinjiang in 2019, Dahua and Hikvision, China’s two largest surveillance companies, use AWS to offer networked surveillance abroad , according to marketing material on the company websites . Hikvision markets a video surveillance platform called “HikCentral” to private companies overseas, which can be also deployed on Azure, according to a post on Hikvision’s website this year . Microsoft denied providing services to Hikvision or partnering with them to provide services to others. OpenAI, which provides its advanced AI models through Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform, said it was subject to Microsoft’s policies and doesn’t support China’s access to its services. AWS did not respond on the record to questions about the cloud services loophole. Another enduring loophole is in the restrictions passed after the Tiananmen massacre that didn’t include newer policing technologies, such as security cameras, surveillance drives, or facial recognition systems. In 2006, 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013, lawmakers introduced bills to try and close the loophole. All failed. The U.S. government under both Republican and Democratic presidents has made other attempts to regulate tech surveillance exports to China. In 2008, the Department of Commerce asked for comment on whether to include “biometric devices” and “integrated security systems” under controlled exports, but ran out of time before the next administration came in. In 2014 and 2015, it tried to tighten controls on surveillance products , but most fell through. In 2024, it sought to restrict exports of face-recognition systems and bar many more military, police, and intelligence end users from receiving U.S. goods, with no success. Some politicians on both sides of the aisle blame the failures in part on the money and political influence of tech companies. “I think we’ve been naive or complicit in the extreme,” said New Jersey GOP Rep. Chris Smith. The U.S., he said, has been “selling and conveying to a malevolent power the ability to destroy us and destroy like-minded Western democracies.” “What do all those companies all have in common? A big wallet,” said Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon. “That is as much as anything is what’s behind the fact we haven’t made as much progress.” A rickshaw driver transports wounded people, with the help of bystanders, to a nearby hospital in Beijing, on Sunday, June 4, 1989, after PLA soldiers fired rounds towards crowds gathered outside Tiananmen Square. (AP Photo/Liu Heung Shing, File) The first round of U.S. prohibitions on Chinese police came after the Tiananmen massacre and applied to “crime control and detection” equipment. They largely stopped U.S. companies from exporting goods to Chinese entities such as restraints, helmets, shields and batons. But the controls were narrowly confined to largely low-tech goods, leaving out advanced technologies that could be used by police and leading at times to puzzling priorities. U.S. regulators warned sex shops against shipping novelty gold handcuffs to China. At the same time, they broadly permitted Silicon Valley companies to sell routers, servers, software, and more recently, AI-powered surveillance systems to Chinese police. For example, despite explicit restrictions on fingerprint recognition systems, U.S. companies still were able to sell gear to process, store and compare fingerprints. In 2006, with bipartisan support, Smith introduced the Global Online Freedom Act to curtail the involvement of American tech companies in Chinese surveillance. Smith drew parallels with IBM’s sale of computing gear to Nazi Germany, which has been well documented by historians . IBM told AP in a follow-up statement that the claim that IBM knowingly collaborated with Nazi Germany was “false and has been rejected by credible historians.” Associations representing the tech and telecommunications industries and dozens of companies stepped up their lobbying against Smith’s proposal, disclosures show. The companies argued the computers, servers and routers they sold in China were no different from what they sold to other countries. Industry groups and individual companies also submitted hundreds of comments to regulators, hoping to influence China-related export regulations. Smith’s bill went nowhere. Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., speaks about China during an interview in his office on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2025. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) “Money talks … When they flood certain members on strategic committees with the money, PAC money and the like, how much easier it is to listen to their narrative that somehow they’re part of the reform?” said Smith. Tech sales to China continued, sometimes with direct government support. Numerous archived webpages show that the U.S. Commercial Service, the export-promoting arm of the Commerce Department, played a crucial role for more than a decade in connecting U.S. vendors to Chinese security agencies and key government officials, including through its marquee Gold Key Matching service. In 2004, the Commercial Service invited American companies selling security technologies and equipment to show off their products at a Chinese security exposition. Two years later, it advertised opportunities for American firms in the “safety and security” market , followed by another publication later describing market opportunities for foreign security products such as inspection control and guard communication systems . Archived webpages also show that under both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, the Commercial Service steadily promoted U.S. participation in policing trade shows , even those that showcased “biological identification technologies” or were initiated by the Chinese Communist Party. Under Bush, the Commerce Department in 2007 hosted a webinar about how to sell to the Chinese security market and promote surveillance tools to China’s public sector. For just $35, the federal agency could offer attendees “market entry-strategies and long-term market penetration plans,” an archived webpage shows. Jeanette Chu, who then worked at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and helped give the 2007 webinar, recalled sometimes having concerns. “I used to ask myself all the time, ‘what is the scary potential of each item?’” said Chu, now a national security and trade expert advising industry. Despite promises to nail shut Washington’s revolving door, President Barack Obama — like presidents before and after him — gave former industry lobbyists and allies top jobs, including Eric Hirschhorn in the Commerce Department, who represented a trade group that lobbied for tech companies exporting abroad. Hirschhorn wrote that Beijing’s surveillance abilities were nothing compared to the half-million surveillance cameras blanketing London. He was put in charge of the office that administers U.S. export controls. A Chinese national flag flutters near surveillance cameras mounted on a lamp post in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, Friday, March 15, 2019. (AP Photo/Andy Wong, File) In an interview, Hirschhorn said export controls alone were an inefficient way to defend human rights. “You can use a computer to type an order or type a love note,” he told AP. “Are you not going to sell computers to China because one out of every 10,000 of them will be used to store data about a dissident?” In 2010, the U.S. State Department’s human rights report warned of “police surveillance, harassment and detentions of activists.” Yet U.S. Ambassador Jon Huntsman led a mission to promote American business interests in the far-west region of Xinjiang, where authorities had arrested thousands of ethnic Uyghurs and cut internet access after deadly unrest the year before . Huntsman did not respond to requests for comment. That same year, the Commercial Service spotlighted opportunities for U.S. companies to sell equipment directly to China’s central government “to install a city-wide infrastructure of security, surveillance, and alarm systems” on its website. A 2015 State Department draft plan for “smart city” cooperation obtained by AP proposed that China and the U.S. collaborate on joint research, such as on crime and “urban security,” and include private sector players such IBM. Additional documents AP obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request show the U.S. government also sought active counter-terrorism cooperation with China, which gave tech companies a chance for closer contact with Chinese authorities even as Beijing broadly labelled protest or dissent among Uyghurs as terrorism. Documents reviewed by the AP show how the U.S. government helped promote opportunities in the Chinese security market to American companies. (AP video Marshall Ritzel) Kevin Wolf, then an assistant secretary in charge of export controls at Commerce, said as news about human rights abuses inside China kept surfacing, he worried about U.S. innovations falling into the wrong hands. Wolf said he began drafting a rule to regulate certain surveillance gear sales in early 2016. “The problem I was struggling with was, mass surveillance can involve everyday ordinary common items: it’s cameras, it’s software, it’s facial recognition stuff and 99 percent of all of those applications are perfectly benign,” said Wolf, now a compliance attorney for industry. “So if you were to say, ban cameras that can read someone’s face, you blow up international trade.” Wolf’s colleagues told him the draft rule was too complicated, Wolf said, and it foundered. In 2018, Congress passed the Export Control Reform Act, giving Commerce authority to make export control rules about advanced technologies. In 2019 and 2020, the Trump administration sanctioned some Chinese officials and surveillance firms over atrocities in Xinjiang. But sales of surveillance equipment continued, albeit at a slower pace — though references to working with the Chinese police would disappear from annual Commerce Department reports for U.S. industry. In 2021, Joe Biden put out an executive order describing Chinese surveillance tech companies as “unusual and extraordinary threats” that enabled serious human rights abuses. In his final months in office, Biden’s administration drew up sprawling rules for exporting advanced computer chips used to develop AI systems. Commerce also floated an updated version of Wolf’s draft rule to keep facial recognition and other mass surveillance tools from reaching military and intelligence agencies and companies, including in China.

Additional documents AP obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request show the U.S. government also sought active counter-terrorism cooperation with China , which gave tech companies a chance for closer contact with Chinese authorities even as Beijing broadly labelled protest or dissent among Uyghurs as terrorism . Documents reviewed by the AP show how the U.S. government helped promote opportunities in the Chinese security market to American companies . ( AP video Marshall Ritzel ) Kevin Wolf , then an assistant secretary in charge of export controls at Commerce , said as news about human rights abuses inside China kept surfacing , he worried about U.S. innovations falling into the wrong hands . Wolf said he began drafting a rule to regulate certain surveillance gear sales in early 2016 . “ The problem I was struggling with was , mass surveillance can involve everyday ordinary common items : it ’ s cameras , it ’ s software , it ’ s facial recognition stuff and 99 percent of all of those applications are perfectly benign , ” said Wolf , now a compliance attorney for industry . “ So if you were to say , ban cameras that can read someone ’ s face , you blow up international trade. ” Wolf ’ s colleagues told him the draft rule was too complicated , Wolf said , and it foundered . In 2018 , Congress passed the Export Control Reform Act , giving Commerce authority to make export control rules about advanced technologies . In 2019 and 2020 , the Trump administration sanctioned some Chinese officials and surveillance firms over atrocities in Xinjiang . But sales of surveillance equipment continued , albeit at a slower pace — though references to working with the Chinese police would disappear from annual Commerce Department reports for U.S. industry . In 2021 , Joe Biden put out an executive order describing Chinese surveillance tech companies as “ unusual and extraordinary threats ” that enabled serious human rights abuses . In his final months in office , Biden ’ s administration drew up sprawling rules for exporting advanced computer chips used to develop AI systems . Commerce also floated an updated version of Wolf ’ s draft rule to keep facial recognition and other mass surveillance tools from reaching military and intelligence agencies and companies , including in China . But once again , Washington lobbyists , lawyers and politicians pushed back . “ The result would slow business considerably and likely result in the loss of customers that do not present any national security or human rights concerns , ” said a Chamber of Commerce filing from late last year . The proposed rule , in the end , stalled out . Gulbahar Haitiwaji , an ethnic Uyghur living in France , says little has changed since she testified to Congress in 2023 urging the U.S. government to “ stop American companies from continuing to be complicit in surveilling our people ” . Gulbahar Haitiwaji , an ethnic Uyghur who wrote a book about the experience of being held in two “ re-education ” camps and police stations in China for more than two years , is sworn in to testify during a special House committee hearing dedicated to countering China , Thursday , March 23 , 2023 , on Capitol Hill in Washington . ( AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster , File ) Haitiwaji was arrested and detained in internment camps in Xinjiang for more than two years , after policing systems based on U.S. technology led Chinese officers to identify her as a “ terrorist. ” She was under constant , excruciating surveillance , with cameras watching her even in the toilet . After she was released in 2019 , she still found herself living in what she calls “ an open-air prison , ” with every move monitored , until she finally left Xinjiang later that year . She said U.S. tech companies show little accountability . “ It ’ s truly disappointing that the United States , one of the most powerful countries in the world , would sell such technology to China despite knowing the potential for serious consequences , ” Haitiwaji said . —- Burke reported from San Francisco and Washington , Kang reported from Beijing and Tau reported from Washington .

The White House is urging Congress to reject a bipartisan proposal that would restrict Nvidia from selling advanced AI chips to China and other countries subject to an embargo. The GAIN AI Act would require chipmakers to prioritise US buyers before exporting high-performance hardware. Lawmakers are debating whether to attach the provision to the annual defence spending bill, a move that could accelerate approval. The White House intervention represents a significant win for Nvidia , which has lobbied to maintain export flexibility amid shifting trade policies. China was previously a significant market for Nvidia, but the firm has pared back expectations due to rising geopolitical risks.

US,dig.watch,news,11 Jul 2025,Huawei challenges Nvidia in global AI chip market,"Digital Watch Observatory Digital Governance in 50+ issues, 500+ actors, 5+ processes Home | Updates | Huawei challenges Nvidia in global AI chip market Huawei seeks foothold in AI chip markets across the Middle East and Southeast Asia as Nvidia faces export restrictions in China. Huawei Technologies is exploring AI chip exports to the Middle East and Southeast Asia in a bid to compete with Nvidia, according to a Bloomberg News report published Thursday. The Chinese telecom firm has contacted potential buyers in the United Arab Emirates , Saudi Arabia , and Thailand to promote its Ascend 910B chips, an earlier-generation AI processor. The offer involves a limited number of chips, reportedly in the low thousands, although specific quantities remain undisclosed. No deals have been finalised so far. Sources cited in the report said there is limited interest in the UAE, and the status of talks in Thailand remains uncertain. Government representatives in Thailand and Saudi Arabia did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. Huawei also declined to comment. The initiative is part of a broader strategy to expand into markets where US chipmakers have long held dominance. Huawei also promotes remote access to CloudMatrix 384, a China -based AI system built using its more advanced chipsets. However, due to supply limitations, the company cannot export these high-end models outside China. The Middle East has quickly become a high-demand region for AI infrastructure, attracting interest from leading technology companies. Nvidia has already struck several regional deals, positioning itself as a major player in AI development across Saudi Arabia and neighbouring countries. Huawei is simultaneously focusing on domestic sales of its newer 910C chips, offering them to Chinese firms that cannot purchase US AI chips due to ongoing export restrictions imposed by Washington. US administrations have long cited national security concerns in limiting China’s access to cutting-edge chip technologies, fearing their potential use in military applications. ‘With the current export controls, we are effectively out of the China datacenter market, which is now served only by competitors such as Huawei,’ an Nvidia spokesperson told Reuters.

US,www.businesskorea.co.kr,news,2025-05-14T11:52:58+09:00,"U.S. Bans Use of Huawei AI Chipsets in All Countries, Including China","The United States has effectively banned the use of Huawei’s artificial intelligence (AI) chipsets in all countries, including China, as part of a broader effort to block advancements in Chinese semiconductor technology that have proven resistant to existing regulations. On May 13 (local time), the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the U.S. Department of Commerce declared that “using Huawei Ascend chipsets anywhere in the world constitutes a violation of U.S. export controls.” Bloomberg reported that “this action by the Commerce Department will make it more difficult for Huawei to manufacture powerful semiconductors for AI and smartphones.” In response to China’s efforts to smuggle U.S. AI chipsets, the BIS also issued guidance on protecting the supply chains of American companies. This effectively serves as an export guideline for AI chipset developers such as NVIDIA and AMD. Additionally, the BIS plans to alert the public to the potential consequences of American AI chipsets being used in Chinese AI models. The BIS’s announcement comes as it scraps the “country-tiered AI chipset export control policy” introduced under former President Joe Biden, which was set to take effect on May 15. On Jan. 15 this year, the Biden administration had announced plans to classify countries into three tiers–ally, general, and adversary–and restrict AI chip exports accordingly. The BIS criticized the Biden-era policy, stating that it “would have impeded American innovation and imposed burdensome new regulatory requirements on companies,” and that “downgrading dozens of countries to tier-2 status could have damaged diplomatic relations.” However, doubts remain over whether the new Commerce Department policy will effectively block China’s technological progress in AI chipsets, including Huawei. Huawei has been targeting Chinese domestic tech firms unable to procure NVIDIA chipsets due to U.S. export restrictions, and has seen some success. One tech industry source noted, “Since Huawei chipsets had little demand outside of China to begin with, it’s unclear whether restricting their use abroad will have much impact,” adding, “As it becomes even harder to acquire American chipsets within China, domestic demand for Huawei’s chipsets could grow even further.” Never miss another article!
